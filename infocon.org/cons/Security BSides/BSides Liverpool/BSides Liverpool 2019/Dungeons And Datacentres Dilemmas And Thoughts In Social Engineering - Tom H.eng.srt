1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,689
she is for coming I realized that

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,010
there's a whole bunch of you know talks

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,509
activities other things you could be

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,190
doing people could be chatting to so I

5
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:14,830
really appreciate your kind of turning

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,268
up to see my talk is dungeons and

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,640
datacenters which is kind of covering

8
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:20,470
some of my thoughts and violence that

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:39,309
I've had with sort of experiences social

10
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:43,420
engineering recently so so so Who am I

11
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:46,870
my name is Tom I've done way too long 15

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,730
years in InfoSec so I consider myself

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,349
kind of long-term listener first-time

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,760
caller as far as this sauce was

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,750
concerned it's my first talk hence why

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,820
I'm kind of bracketed as being a rookie

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,190
the ridiculously long combination of

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,020
letters there means that I'm a senior

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,730
subject matter expert for advanced

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,759
intrusion testing at Lloyds Banking

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,408
Group which is the repeated three-letter

22
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:11,560
acronym way of saying that I kind of

23
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:13,799
manage scope and design and perform read

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,259
team testing for Lloyds Banking Group

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm a avid gamer of pretty much any type

26
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:22,630
so you know from computer games through

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,399
to board games through to card games

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,479
if basically gave me a tennis ball and

29
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:26,619
said throw this at a wall and you'll

30
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:27,939
score some points I'll probably sit

31
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,999
there for a few hours

32
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:33,098
a massive psychology language and

33
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:34,689
systems nerd so any of that stuff I

34
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,669
absolutely love it it takes up a bunch

35
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,048
of time I'll read anything about it kind

36
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:40,419
of dig deeper and kind of look at

37
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,770
outsource stuff and then also I must

38
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:44,380
kind of social engineering junkie so

39
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,060
it's one more special isms that I fall

40
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,548
under the subject matter expert bit of

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,079
my job title I kind of started digging

42
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,270
into it probably six or seven years ago

43
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,439
and then since I've been doing red

44
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,969
teaming in the last sort of three or

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,678
four it's become kind of a lot more

46
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:59,399
focused and I sort of decent part of

47
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,399
what I do day to day

48
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,449
so what I'm gonna do is kind of go down

49
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,640
the rabbit hole go through red teaming

50
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,170
what it is a little bit social

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,070
engineering how that fits in and then

52
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,149
we're going to go into the bits of

53
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,350
social engineering that I want to talk

54
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,300
about the bits that I think are

55
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,220
interesting and there's some stuff that

56
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,330
we can kind of learn about how to deal

57
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,710
with people and how to you know

58
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,070
appropriately social engineer them that

59
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,980
sort of thing so I've interest who works

60
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,540
in a Red Team offensive security or that

61
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,079
type of thing or for a company that has

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,609
got that cool so for you guys I hope I

63
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,380
don't teach you how to much how to suck

64
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,430
eggs for the start of it and in the last

65
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:39,850
part of it you'll get some sort of

66
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:42,160
useful information out of it so that

67
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,320
quote there is the in theory water red

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,609
themers you know it's a independent

69
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,310
group that challenges an organization

70
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,870
etc etc etc sounds really cool you know

71
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,239
is really appealing and probably one of

72
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,940
the more more interesting bits of

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,940
InfoSec in my opinion in actual fact

74
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,709
it's it's isn't hacking it's hack it's

75
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,959
really really heavily bureaucratic and

76
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,970
regulated hacking with like 80 percent

77
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,050
reporting and that isn't any different

78
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,930
when you work for a bank it's probably

79
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,360
if anything a little bit worse

80
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,440
so scoping red team engagements and that

81
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,510
sort of thing and what you include and

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,410
what you don't is a real art

83
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,359
particularly when you're dealing with

84
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,070
sort of a large organization they don't

85
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,870
want you to go everything's in scope

86
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,070
even though the ideal for a red team if

87
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,080
you can approve anything is that yes

88
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,370
everything's in scope so as a whole

89
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,600
bunch of those arguments that go on on a

90
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,380
day-to-day to their life but hopefully

91
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,530
going to talk about some of the more

92
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,989
interesting bits so social engineering

93
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,250
within red teaming so red team is meant

94
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,540
to be a holistic way of testing you

95
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,310
meant to test kind of everything in the

96
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,890
entire environment allowed people break

97
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,500
stuff down into being PPT I use kind of

98
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,470
pppt I always have to check that I've

99
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,090
said there are around peas so yes so

100
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:50,620
covering people process physical and

101
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,430
Technology whenever we do tests so when

102
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,140
people talk about social engineering

103
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,790
they tend to go this is the bit we're

104
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,548
interested in you know this is the bit

105
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,019
where people talk about the humans being

106
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,519
an organisation's biggest weakness or

107
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,739
there's no patch for human stupidity and

108
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,060
all that solve really really bad phrases

109
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,519
that don't encourage good behaviors in

110
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,380
your user base in actual fact or I tend

111
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,720
to find that the really interesting bits

112
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,340
tend to come when we look at the kind of

113
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,129
intersection between people process

114
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,780
technology and physical and how like the

115
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,539
people monitor those controls how they

116
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,948
use them that sort of thing so you find

117
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,210
a lot of vulnerabilities in in the way

118
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:23,680
that the people interact with them and

119
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,669
in a case of kind of the blue team which

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,710
is the only kind of blue thing I'll

121
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,940
probably discuss for this talk like the

122
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,739
defense's you can put in place there are

123
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,270
still some and if you look at Defense's

124
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,280
in terms of technology or process

125
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,690
controls or physical controls to stop

126
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,070
people doing the wrong thing then that

127
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,160
does actually prevent a quite a few

128
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,080
social engineering attacks so from

129
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,610
breaking down social engineering I break

130
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,020
it down into kind of four main sections

131
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:50,380
so ocean stroke recon which is a massive

132
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,520
subject in its own and is the foundation

133
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,200
of pretty much any social engineering

134
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,030
you do if you want to do good social

135
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,010
engineering you need good ocean a recon

136
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,210
fortunately I haven't got as long in

137
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,889
this talk as I'd like to kind of dig

138
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,770
really deep into how to do ocean recon

139
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:04,210
that sort of thing but you know it's an

140
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,419
essential thing you can find a whole ton

141
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,969
of stuff out there online on it so then

142
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:11,740
we've got fishing which is you know the

143
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,380
most well known you know really high

144
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,660
volume stuff and you know I think the

145
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,490
figure is 65% of breaches start with a

146
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,010
phishing email that sort of thing

147
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,840
then we go up fishing which is phone

148
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,159
social engineering and doing over the

149
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,359
phone and then the bit I'm always good

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,889
to that there isn't a word that starts

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,539
with itching or ends in itching is

152
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,220
impersonation which is the in-person

153
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,870
physical part they see where you go in

154
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,039
talk to people and actually get them to

155
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:38,080
do what you want in person so I'm going

156
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,030
to cover these two areas mainly cause

157
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,630
fishings kind of a thing all of its own

158
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,700
and phishing impersonation cover a lot

159
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,870
the same type of skills a lot of the you

160
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,639
know dealing with people dealing with

161
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:55,060
individuals conversation rapport that

162
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:57,099
sort stuff so if you break down phishing

163
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,740
an impersonation so it starts off with

164
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:01,210
the ocean recon phase right the start as

165
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,669
I said it's a whole whole world of

166
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,710
interest and details then we go on to

167
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,969
kind of pretext development this is

168
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,590
where you're developing the person that

169
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,940
you're going to be when you are social

170
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,679
engineering someone when you're going in

171
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,880
when you're calling them you know this

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,130
is how you define what it is that you're

173
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,229
going to do then you go for what is the

174
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,940
bump or initial approach with phishing

175
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,560
this is really really simple so this is

176
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,050
the bit where you know they pick up the

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,789
phone when you're doing impersonation a

178
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,560
bit more complicated it's the bit where

179
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:27,360
you stop being a

180
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,470
stranger to them so you answer put your

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,730
questions as you approach them in order

182
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,950
to kind of put my ease stop them

183
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,080
questioning you too much then we go into

184
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,610
building trust and rapport which is what

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,560
normal people would call a conversation

186
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,360
but when you say when you do social

187
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,380
engineering there's a whole bunch of

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,370
other factors that you're trying to do

189
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,080
at the same time as having that

190
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,730
conversation and then achieving your

191
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,139
objective so trying to get someone to do

192
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,850
something they may or may not want to do

193
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:52,260
in order to help your attack or or

194
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:53,370
progress what it is you're doing so as

195
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,450
we go to kind of further down the rabbit

196
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,370
hole these the bits that I'm probably

197
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,370
gonna focus on that bumps or approach

198
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,660
stuff is it's kind of fairly low-key and

199
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,830
not something I'm gonna go to detail on

200
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,150
but they're the kind of protects

201
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,770
development how you work out what you're

202
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,719
going to be how you gonna be approached

203
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,310
it and the building trust and rapport

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,720
section the bit that are kind of the

205
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,169
main meat of your social engineering

206
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,270
engagement cool so I'm gonna go over

207
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,340
some of the stuff that I use as kind of

208
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,389
weapons at my disposal so as I said I've

209
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,280
done a bunch of social engineering

210
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:21,840
research but a bunch of reading about it

211
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,820
as well as a couple of different

212
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,489
training courses that sort of thing I'm

213
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,440
a social engineering pentest

214
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,180
professional and master's level social

215
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,820
engineering expert from social engineer

216
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,530
dog but on top of that there's some

217
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,729
extra elements that I've sort of used in

218
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,849
order to help me with these dilemmas and

219
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:40,650
problems so psychology and sociology

220
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,910
huge subject whereas social engineering

221
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,609
as an idea has been around for like

222
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,780
10-15 years obviously psychology and

223
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,700
sociology have been around for hundreds

224
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,719
so there's a whole bunch of tools a

225
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,340
whole bunch of stuff that lets you

226
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,400
dissect how people work what they think

227
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,049
that sort of thing and it is where a ton

228
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,830
of my research time goes is into

229
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:01,770
thinking into this so another thing

230
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,240
which is kind of quite awkward for most

231
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,960
techies and that sort thing improv

232
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,270
acting so the really really similar part

233
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,239
of social engineering applies this is

234
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,039
kind of the the impersonation section

235
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,270
you know when you're there when you talk

236
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,729
to someone you kind of want to be able

237
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,010
to come up with ideas discuss new things

238
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,150
and kind of edit what you're how you're

239
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,750
behaving and what you're talking about

240
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,159
in order to apply better to the target

241
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,020
it's also the bit that at least I find

242
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,940
is the big fear of social engineering is

243
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,530
that part of going oh my god and we

244
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,849
stood there and I'm gonna choke I'm not

245
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,189
going to know what to say I'm going to

246
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,300
panic actually The Improv acting stuff

247
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,979
really helps with that because you're

248
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,640
put on the spot like twenty times and

249
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,640
every time you do it

250
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,720
and then kind of the the big nerd

251
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,050
influence and what influence the title

252
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,880
the talk I think it puts me second on

253
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,849
the nerd hierarchy on the geek hierarchy

254
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,040
slightly below furries um I've been

255
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,980
doing kind of D&D tabletop stuff for

256
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,260
like 15 years I've been a larper for

257
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,329
like well over half my life in the last

258
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,680
few years I've run seven or eight

259
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,750
different events for people where we've

260
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,609
built entire immersive worlds we've kind

261
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,380
of you know developed characters for

262
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,329
them things to interact with done like

263
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,070
20 different pretext generations which

264
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:14,180
we define as you know roles for them to

265
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,920
interact with that sort of thing and

266
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,140
it's a really really good opportunity to

267
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,319
study human behavior human interaction

268
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,519
in kind of weird settings so like very

269
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,079
very difficult in real life to watch

270
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,850
someone who's scared for their life but

271
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:28,819
I get to do it like 20 times every event

272
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,800
which is great you know and and going if

273
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,810
I give a person X Y Zed information

274
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,969
what will they then do with it which is

275
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,260
something you just can't do without well

276
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,760
occasionally associated new you get to

277
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,170
do that but as I've kind of done it I've

278
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,430
seen the parallels between the two quite

279
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,569
a lot so dioramas and thoughts which is

280
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,729
kind of the main focal point of this

281
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,890
talk which is kind of issues or problems

282
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,230
I've experienced whilst doing social

283
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,430
engineering and the tools or ideas that

284
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,370
I've used in order to help kind of fix

285
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,430
them

286
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:00,320
so the ptex development part as I said

287
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:04,069
realized really heavily on ocean and

288
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,660
recon that little diagram is one bit

289
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,449
that's really important assess what you

290
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,069
can and can't do so like I would fail

291
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:11,839
miserably to impersonate an Olympic

292
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,610
athlete a pregnant woman or a brain

293
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,339
surgeon and like you kind of have to

294
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,769
accept that but that being said in some

295
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,180
situations you can go I'm going to

296
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,440
impersonate a brain surgeon because I

297
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,239
need to do it for five minutes to this

298
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,589
one guy before I leave him away and

299
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,980
never get asked questions about it again

300
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:30,350
so it is kind of possible to learn some

301
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,630
things very very quickly I crammed at

302
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,699
one point to be an interior designer in

303
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,750
the space of two and a half hours and

304
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,130
managed to carry off a relatively

305
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,199
successfully for like an hour and a half

306
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,029
in a discussion with people kind of you

307
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:42,620
have to understand what it is you your

308
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:43,850
pretext needs so what you're trying to

309
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,829
accomplish with this social engineering

310
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,779
engagement and then look at who you are

311
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:50,529
and what you think you can be within the

312
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,529
timeframes you've got

313
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:57,709
so sorry just checking back on that so a

314
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,810
couple of dilemmas that I face when

315
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:01,518
doing this is what preparations should I

316
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,619
do because that's a really kind of hard

317
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,850
thing to decide there's a whole whole

318
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,290
world of preparation you could be doing

319
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,480
you then what's useful what's not and

320
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,790
then there's a thing about how perfect

321
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,139
is too perfect for your pretext you know

322
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,449
if you're approaching someone exactly

323
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:21,800
how detailed you want to make it and

324
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:23,540
what you want to talk about so one of

325
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,920
the things of course want a spontaneity

326
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,300
versus preparedness style Emma so you've

327
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,099
got a temptation to write a full

328
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,300
autobiography you know you've got you

329
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,490
know you're going in you pretending to

330
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,660
be a certain person and you want to

331
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,980
write all the details you want to

332
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,329
prepare everything if you like me you

333
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,769
want to kind of design everything put it

334
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:41,149
all down make sure you've got it all

335
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,790
embedded in your mind that sort of stuff

336
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,949
but if you lock yourself down too hard

337
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,300
you lose the ability to kind of

338
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:48,889
improvise when you need to when you're

339
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,800
talking to someone so if you approach

340
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:53,540
someone and they're you know kid is does

341
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,120
football then you want to be able to

342
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,589
switch your pretext to going yeah Mike

343
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,670
it also does football you establish

344
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,809
yourself as part of a tribe with them

345
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,399
you build a link with them you start

346
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:02,660
building trust and rapport and you can

347
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:07,009
then leverage that further on to get

348
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,170
what you want so being prepared is great

349
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:10,309
as much as you can remember it all like

350
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,660
that's one of things I tend to find as

351
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:13,189
well is that you get to a point where

352
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,809
you've gone I'm not gonna remember all

353
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:17,930
the details of this I'll just remember

354
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,519
certain key things and then kind of be

355
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,949
spontaneous spontaneous with the rest

356
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,569
but even like spontaneity requires a

357
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,040
basic amount of background knowledge for

358
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:28,000
you to leverage in order to know what to

359
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,410
do with it so I use this which is

360
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,439
Whitney Maxwell's kind of breakdown of

361
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,269
digital footprints I'll turn it on his

362
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:37,129
head and go okay like different

363
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:39,889
categories of stuff so core intermediate

364
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:41,449
peripheral information so things like

365
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:42,860
personal preferences likes and hobbies

366
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:44,359
really good things to be spontaneous

367
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,889
with really good thing to connect with

368
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,879
people on and talk about a little bit

369
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,839
you need to do a little bit of research

370
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,860
on anything that you're going to be

371
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,300
spontaneous about that you're going to

372
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,430
bring up so you can at least cover it

373
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,809
the kind of I've heard it termed as

374
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,979
being the related songs man so knowing a

375
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:57,850
little bit about everything so you can

376
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,899
use that to better leverage your pretext

377
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,910
when you're talking about the kind of

378
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,730
intermediate stuff so categories like

379
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,699
you

380
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,530
hometown employer religion you want to

381
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,300
do make sure that's consistent research

382
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,709
you know in the facts that you can come

383
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,109
across as someone who works for company

384
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,000
acts or who lives in town X you don't

385
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,320
beat them going all whereabouts in you

386
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,380
know whereabouts in least you live and

387
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,850
you're going all by the car park is you

388
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,020
know absolutely dreadful so you want to

389
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,910
make sure you know enough details that

390
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,380
you can say that if you are questioned

391
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,339
in normal conversation about it

392
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,410
you can still come up with the right

393
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,880
ideas and then kind of peripheral stuff

394
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,680
which is the end of an individual facts

395
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,820
about you that's tough you need to know

396
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,079
it because everyone knows their

397
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,120
individual individual facts about them

398
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,530
but it doesn't need to necessarily be

399
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,130
researched or linked into anything or

400
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,720
anything like that

401
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,920
as long as you're consistent with it and

402
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,390
you're not giving you know you know

403
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,099
introducing yourself as Bob to person

404
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:48,210
one and then Kyle to person two you

405
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,070
should measure the time to find so the

406
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,900
other aspect the too good to be true

407
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,060
dilemma so this is something I've seen a

408
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,060
couple of times whilst doing social

409
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,130
engineering people are naturally

410
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,729
suspicious of anything that's too

411
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,300
perfect

412
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,070
so you do eurosam

413
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,270
you find out everything about this

414
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,250
person that you're gonna be targeting

415
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,750
and you're like right I'm gonna write

416
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,360
the perfect pretext he's into

417
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,820
photography his kids do football

418
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,400
he's wife's a chef so you show up with

419
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,170
you know your cooking book under one

420
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,490
hand your phone your camera onto the

421
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,140
other one and start talking about how

422
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,030
great your kids football was and he's

423
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,370
gonna look at you and go that feels

424
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,290
wrong because that's too close to me and

425
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,670
normally there's more differentiation

426
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,439
between you and strangers you mean

427
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,969
unless this is gonna be you know unless

428
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,560
you you pretext this that that guys are

429
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,670
gonna meet your soulmate you probably

430
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,910
don't want to be going to that level of

431
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:41,160
detail so what I find is that there's a

432
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,260
kind of a role play game technique

433
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,480
that's really useful here so sit down

434
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,100
and go write that list of what I am or

435
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,290
what I could be and what pretext needs

436
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,060
build out list it out in a big page and

437
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,829
then go I'm going to choose one of those

438
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,510
at random rather than necessarily I'm

439
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,470
gonna go straight for this first one

440
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,270
that I've made that's absolutely perfect

441
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,730
so take all the elements split them out

442
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,770
and then use a kind of random generator

443
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,300
to go yeah I'll be this because then

444
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,780
it's not going to be precisely spot on

445
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,780
and perfect

446
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,240
cool so this is a something that comes

447
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,920
from 1730 when they started defining the

448
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,780
properties of actors in plays and that

449
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,300
sort of thing but it's something that I

450
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,560
find really useful so my brain naturally

451
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,270
works and approaches stuff and I'll go

452
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,130
here's the details here's the facts that

453
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,590
saw stuff this sort of thing is the

454
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,260
thing that I never really think about

455
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,430
unless I'm kind of forced to so I won't

456
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,080
go through them all but a few of them

457
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,670
like you know the dramatic need of what

458
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,020
you're trying to accomplish kind of the

459
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,280
attitude of the character that you're

460
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,860
trying to portray the pretext at you

461
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,600
developed that saw stuff and then like

462
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,730
weaknesses and mannerisms are good ways

463
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,380
to kind of differentiate yourself break

464
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,720
away from being the same thing every

465
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,460
time you do it and kind of also help you

466
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,650
load better into what I consider to be

467
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,060
kind of different brain VM in that you

468
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:56,640
are then that thing and you're that

469
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:58,290
person so as caring pretext generation

470
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,240
so I'm going to go on to kind of

471
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,260
developing trust and rapport so this is

472
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,310
the foundation of every social

473
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,840
engineering attack really really heavily

474
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,760
leverages body language and and that

475
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,380
sort of thing I'm not going to go into

476
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,660
detail on that because there's a lot of

477
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:16,650
people who covered it books by you know

478
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,230
Ian man Paul Ekman Joe Navarro as well

479
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,670
as talks by Chris Hutton Aggie shark

480
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:25,110
Ian man a whole bunch of other people so

481
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:28,800
sociology kind of defines a breakdown of

482
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,910
conversations into form and content so

483
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,849
you cannot kind of analyze them

484
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,699
independently of each other and an

485
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,120
aspect of the form of conversations is a

486
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:41,610
thing called flow which was defined in

487
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,990
2014 research paper by Guttenberg post

488
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:48,030
MERS an owl so there is defined as being

489
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,980
the way a conversation is experienced as

490
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,930
being smooth efficient and mutually

491
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,760
engaging and as a social engineer I read

492
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,959
that description and went holy crap I

493
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,980
want that in every single social

494
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,450
engineering conversation I have if

495
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,830
you've got those three elements then

496
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,540
that conversation is going to be going

497
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,860
well you're gonna find it really easy to

498
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,060
develop trust and rapport and that

499
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,660
person's gonna be a lot more compliant

500
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,659
when it comes to it

501
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,870
so talking about the form part of it

502
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,309
there's the classic social engineering

503
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:15,379
advice you know you match you match the

504
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:18,439
tone pitch speed and volume of the

505
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,429
person you're talking to you've got a

506
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,750
bear in mind that when you've developed

507
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,949
that pretext before you've L this

508
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,510
character that you're going to be whilst

509
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,189
you're doing your social engineering but

510
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,869
if you try and do this stuff too hard

511
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,160
because sometimes break that so that's a

512
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,899
conscious decision you need to make as

513
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,520
to whether to you know if your planks if

514
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,360
you want to be someone who's nervous or

515
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,679
apprehensive or you know excited then

516
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,320
you might be talking a lot quicker than

517
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,299
normal you might be kind of like putting

518
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,918
more herbs and and pauses into your

519
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,570
conversation so you don't necessarily

520
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,650
want to match all those if you still

521
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,399
want to come across as the same kind of

522
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,320
aspects one of the things yeah never try

523
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,150
and do accents like unless you've got an

524
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,439
accent that you know 100% you can pass

525
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,049
for that person if you're put into that

526
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,880
city then don't don't even try and do it

527
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,168
learn from Sean Connery you know stick

528
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,330
to whatever your traditional accent is

529
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:05,150
and the other thing that I've found that

530
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,699
isn't included in that se advice I don't

531
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,380
whether it's a positive UK thing because

532
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,760
you know we shift around kind of accents

533
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,700
and formality and different places so

534
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,039
much but changing varying your formality

535
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,110
so abbreviating words not using words

536
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,640
that are too long or doing the opposite

537
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,889
and being really formal with something

538
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,450
can really help to kind of put across

539
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,380
your needs what you're trying to do what

540
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:29,419
you're trying to accomplish that sort of

541
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:30,890
thing so one of the other things I found

542
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:33,049
is that a lot of traditional social

543
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,700
engineering advice is you dealing with

544
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:36,440
an individual you know you approaching

545
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,690
that one person and getting them to do

546
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,330
what you want and it's really really

547
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,500
rare that well it's pretty often that

548
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,270
you'll find that that person's in a

549
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,320
group of people and that's a very very

550
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:50,600
different situation to approach so what

551
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,700
I'll try to do a lot of time is when you

552
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,320
first enter a group conversation look at

553
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,610
positions of body blading and feet so

554
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,990
like where your hips shoulders head

555
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,090
pointing and where your feet are

556
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,590
pointing that can help show kind of how

557
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,600
the authority and flow of that

558
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,699
conversation goes who's important who

559
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,260
you like who that sort of thing and then

560
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,210
you can kind of match that to some

561
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,919
extent to make sure you fit in now

562
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,090
another one of things that that kind of

563
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,830
traditional social engineering advice

564
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,230
comes along with is being kind of

565
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,210
synchronous being similar to the people

566
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,350
talking about same things you know

567
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,180
agreeing on every sub

568
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,790
that sort of thing and matching them in

569
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,320
a whole bunch of ways actually sometimes

570
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,850
you'll find especially positioning group

571
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,439
conversations that you want to be what

572
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,840
they call alternating or complementary

573
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,370
so this means that you have a value to

574
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,870
add to the conversation you're not being

575
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,850
the same as what they're saying you're

576
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,409
adding something new but you need to

577
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,840
make sure it's not a conflicting thing

578
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,160
so add something new that kind of

579
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,919
couples on to what they've been saying

580
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,470
and then listening out for common

581
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,360
grounding noises so this was defined by

582
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,060
someone called Kasim or a researcher

583
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,500
called Kashima which is the noises we

584
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,020
make during a conversation when we're

585
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,640
not the one talking that confirm that

586
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,080
we're still part of that conversation so

587
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,220
they're yep's aha that sort of thing

588
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,659
listen for those and see what the ones

589
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,460
that are that are used in that social

590
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,440
context and try and mimic those when

591
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,810
you're agreeing to stuff it's really

592
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,280
good like it's like psychology wise it

593
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,139
establishes you as being part of their

594
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,490
tribe even though that tribe is just

595
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,900
people in this conversation it

596
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,950
establishes being part of that and

597
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,410
instantly kind of connects you to people

598
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,240
so onto flow it's as I said it's really

599
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:29,510
a ephemeral concept measuring how well a

600
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:31,400
conversation is going it's kind of key

601
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,870
on the prompts for transfer of focus

602
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,980
just to be able to kind of assess how

603
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,969
well it's going so if you listen to two

604
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,680
people who've got really good flow

605
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,420
they'll be hardly any gap between one of

606
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,940
them finishing on the other one starting

607
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,860
and people won't talk over each other

608
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,420
they won't interrupt as much like he'll

609
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,979
naturally kind of bounce between people

610
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,920
and they'll pass the different amounts

611
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,630
of focus so that focus transfer is

612
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,340
normally less than 200 milliseconds in a

613
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,230
good conversation so if you're thinking

614
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,760
for more than a fifth of a second about

615
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,140
what you're gonna say then it can make

616
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,070
it seem like you're not really part of

617
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,100
the conversation and like the

618
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,929
conversations going awkwardly flow comes

619
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,449
really easy for people who talk a lot so

620
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:08,750
these days especially you know your text

621
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,070
your email you'll slack or whatever I've

622
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,720
started trying to force myself to

623
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,850
actually call people on the phone and

624
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,710
talk to them because like exercising

625
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:18,080
those muscles is super important and and

626
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,640
if you're not doing that then you kind

627
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,760
of start falling out over the way to

628
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,010
make good conversation so there's a

629
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,940
really good improv accounting game for

630
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,180
when you're doing social engineering

631
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,500
with a group of you or a pair of you you

632
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,150
want to make sure the flow between you

633
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,910
is kind of really strong and

634
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,870
you're not going to you know talk over

635
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,700
each other you're not gonna interrupt

636
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,860
which is a really simple game involving

637
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,040
counting so the concept being the

638
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,850
between you you need to count to 20

639
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,379
you're not going to just take it in

640
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,810
turns you're gonna say whichever number

641
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,430
you feel like saying and then you after

642
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,870
about four or five times of doing it and

643
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,340
talking over each other way you both say

644
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,840
to at the same time or you both so for

645
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,250
eventually get to the stage where you're

646
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,560
naturally picking up on that person's

647
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,940
kind of body language and cues that

648
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,500
they're about to speak and you'll stop

649
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,820
talking over them so much and being able

650
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,260
to fill up that with whoever your social

651
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,060
engineering with means that when you end

652
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,470
up with your target you not likely to

653
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,580
kind of enter in that same situation and

654
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,100
they'll find it a lot easier to enter

655
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,020
into the flow of your conversation and

656
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,840
then the other one which is really

657
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,389
really good for active listening so if

658
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,230
you're talking to people then a lot of

659
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,430
the time you'll be sat there thinking

660
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,020
about what you're going to say next

661
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,480
rather than what they're actually saying

662
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,070
so there's an improv game which involves

663
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,680
starting your sentence with the last

664
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,780
letter with the last person sentence

665
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,520
that's really really good and is really

666
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,840
good for forcing you to listen right to

667
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,090
the very end of a sentence before you

668
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,669
start the next one if you can do that

669
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,139
with that same lack of talk too much of

670
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,610
a gap then you become a really good

671
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,750
active listener people really start to

672
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,340
kind of engage with you and talk to you

673
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,630
about stuff and that's really good you

674
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,580
can do it deliberately if you go to

675
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,020
someone and go hey let's you know do

676
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,399
that game whilst we're talking you can

677
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,110
have a regular conversation whilst

678
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,130
applying that and likewise you can apply

679
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,050
it to people who aren't really paying

680
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,070
attention so if they do even if they

681
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,960
don't know that you're playing that

682
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,250
improv game you can do it and kind of

683
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,330
just force yourself to wait till the end

684
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:05,540
of a sentence before you think about

685
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:07,610
what you're going to say so content so

686
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,170
content is what you're actually gonna

687
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,159
say to you target you know is this it's

688
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,620
the things you're gonna deliver the

689
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,720
things you're gonna discuss so you

690
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,399
always want to let them lead and kind of

691
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,760
use the work that you put into your

692
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,890
pretext earlier to let to help kind of

693
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,740
shape and and direct the conversation

694
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,360
and make sure you've got stuff to add

695
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,700
you want to try and break bring people

696
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,370
into helping you so people don't want to

697
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,200
back out after commit to doing something

698
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,879
people will find that if they've started

699
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,290
doing something for you they'll carry on

700
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,490
doing that something for you all go

701
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,010
carry on doing something else for you

702
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,840
you know really kind of get those stuff

703
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,190
in early to know what you're kind of

704
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,790
framing to get them because you're pull

705
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,940
for what you want to do later

706
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:52,090
so having another person to shift and

707
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,290
blame - for any kind of effort or rule

708
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,540
breaking the need is really really

709
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,549
useful so going oh god my boss is asking

710
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,899
me to do this or you know or my wife

711
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:00,700
wants me to do this because she'll be

712
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,049
really upset if I don't people can

713
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,580
empathize with having a you know

714
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:04,240
potentially grumpy partner or a

715
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,129
pain-in-the-ass boss

716
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,150
and so they'll instantly kind of put

717
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,309
that puts you into one of their tribes

718
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,260
as well and then also if they're feeling

719
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:12,639
if there's sort of negative feeling or

720
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,379
they don't want to do what is you're

721
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,880
asking then they're not directing that

722
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,960
you they're directing that at some guy

723
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,100
who's off in the background here they

724
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,970
never meet and then they'd be aware of

725
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,928
the need to pivot so pivoting is one of

726
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,140
the things that gets discussed quite

727
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:30,940
often so it's a situation where the

728
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,760
target is either intentionally or not is

729
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:38,350
changing your pretext or kind of the

730
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,270
frame of your attack so situations where

731
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,709
it feels like they're putting you into a

732
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,540
situation where either they're correct

733
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,450
or you're correct so if you come in and

734
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,418
go hi I'm Dave from IT and they go well

735
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,470
I know everyone from IT then this is the

736
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:53,200
point where you need to kind of pivot

737
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,720
and go or actually I'm a contractor or I

738
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,640
only started last week or basically find

739
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,929
a third option in order to be able to

740
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,040
give them something that makes them feel

741
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,780
like they're still correct

742
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,799
you haven't lied to them and they can

743
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:07,570
carry on about their business so

744
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,340
roleplay games are kind of discuss this

745
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,960
is being an option three traditional

746
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,889
difference between kind of tabletop

747
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,080
role-playing games and that sort of

748
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,340
thing versus computer games is that

749
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
they'll always be kind of an option

750
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,490
three because you're in the real world

751
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,460
and you've got everything to work with

752
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,720
this under the Sun so there's a really

753
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,179
good improv cornerstone for this which

754
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,470
is the yes and game so someone make

755
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:29,860
something up the next person goes

756
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,330
yes and so you basically confirm what

757
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,309
the person said and then add something

758
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,570
to it now when you're doing social

759
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,799
engineering you end up a situation where

760
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,780
you need to pivot that's because they've

761
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,950
said no book to you which is a really

762
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,678
really hard thing and tends to break

763
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,960
down in profit improvise those who

764
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,880
improvisation so there's a few

765
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,110
role-playing games and saw tabletop

766
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,090
games that are really really good for

767
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,799
practicing this so there's one called

768
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:54,129
The Adventures of Baron von Munchausen

769
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,340
which is a one set of being a like late

770
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,360
1800s kind of adventuring Baron where

771
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,980
you go this is the

772
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,510
easy story I made up and then someone

773
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,100
challenges you and you need to come up

774
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,080
with some idea going yes you're right

775
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,850
but this is why that's right and I'm

776
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,100
still right so kind of learning those

777
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,500
things to do in order to be able to kind

778
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,270
of still confirm that they are correct

779
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,450
and that the challenges is valid but

780
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,770
answer it and move on so this is

781
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,680
something again super easy to practice

782
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:23,980
with friends you know I play a game

783
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,290
called well terms bullshit with a friend

784
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,420
of mine and I'll say something that's

785
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,580
that is nonsense always you know a lie

786
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,080
that's made up they'll call bullshit and

787
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,580
go that's bullshit because of this and

788
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,949
then your immediate response to that

789
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,750
needs to be yeah but this is actually

790
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,670
why it's still true and and you kind of

791
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,650
have a vague argument where you're not

792
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,970
actually arguing really easy to practice

793
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,110
with friends a really good thing to kind

794
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,110
of develop and kind of work from there

795
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,340
so that's kind of getting towards a

796
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:53,230
conclusion a talk I think I covered the

797
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,610
key stuff I wanted to thanks for

798
00:26:53,230 --> 00:27:00,100
listening so the takeaways whilst social

799
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,840
engineering engagements even working in

800
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,040
part of a red team and it being actually

801
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,689
part my job is it's something that

802
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,040
doesn't happen all the time actually

803
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,990
finding Talent ways to practice is

804
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,350
really easy so games like that type of

805
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,270
thing like one of my things recently has

806
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,070
been trying to start a conversation with

807
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,600
three strangers every day which is

808
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,460
really really difficult especially if

809
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,360
you're in London on the tube you get

810
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,400
looked at like an absolutely crazy

811
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,649
person but trying to find ways to you

812
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,230
know use words at the very least and

813
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,420
then a bit of conscious effort and kind

814
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,620
of research and a bit of planning can

815
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,410
change your in bonus to a Christmas

816
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,179
bonus so people who are way of TMZ and

817
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,100
stuff will understand so going from

818
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,510
taking your intelligence and kind of an

819
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,459
analytical mindset and that sort of

820
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,930
thing and using it towards conversations

821
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,920
and discussions can mean that you

822
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,450
actually come across as being really

823
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,920
charismatic when actually just

824
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,320
substituting it for a whole bunch of

825
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,690
stuff you've learned and practiced and

826
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,820
then whilst the humans are the last line

827
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,650
of defense and all that sort of thing

828
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,870
they can actually be sometimes helped by

829
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,610
process and technology controls and

830
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,020
physical controls to stop and doing

831
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:02,800
things that they really really shouldn't

832
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,850
be so if you want to contact me and talk

833
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,460
to me about any of this stuff afterwards

834
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:09,129
or my contact stuff down there Twitter

835
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,920
Gmail I hang around on the many hats

836
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:13,840
Club discord and in the SEO

837
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:28,900
and Red Team channels so always happy to

838
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:30,760
chat there yeah cool any questions so I

839
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,520
struggle to give direct examples as part

840
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,080
of the fact so I work I work for a large

841
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,090
bank and they've gone I can't talk about

842
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,470
any actual details of stuff like that

843
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,730
but so if stuff when social engineering

844
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,730
stuff goes wrong especially if it's kind

845
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:48,670
of a really key pivotal moment tend to

846
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,950
find that it can massively skew things

847
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,470
it raises suspicions in people that's

848
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,910
all things so a lot of the time it's one

849
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,710
of those things where if it starts to go

850
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,900
wrong you can't really remediate and fix

851
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,330
it unless you can pivot well and kind of

852
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,290
transfer it off at the time then you end

853
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,730
up in a situation where you're going

854
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,680
right we just have to avoid that person

855
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,790
that subjects that that protects these

856
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,470
ballots because you don't want to kind

857
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,600
of carry on pushing something if people

858
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:15,940
start to get suspicions it's a real real

859
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:19,000
slippery slippery slope so yeah so there

860
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,230
is some degree of kind of going here's

861
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,420
my get-out-of-jail-free card I'm going

862
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,460
to walk away ideally just leaving and

863
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,690
going we're just going to leave that and

864
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,430
let it be someone who's vaguely

865
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:40,270
suspicious and hasn't reported it and

866
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:42,160
hopefully doesn't so we tend to try and

867
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,360
feed it back so we don't do it to

868
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,340
individuals is one of the kind of

869
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,899
cardinal rules because for social

870
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,550
engineering anyone can trip up anyone

871
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,260
can make those mistakes and you don't

872
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,060
want any organization kind of

873
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,080
persecuting the individual for having

874
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,659
made the mistake that anyone can make

875
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,800
but yeah we do kind of go this is the

876
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,300
type of thing you need to be looking at

877
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,159
but a lot of the time it's just talking

878
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,139
about like awareness of the fact that

879
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,000
this is a type of attack and then kind

880
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,040
of encouraging critical thinking so

881
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,630
people actually go is this really what's

882
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,350
going on rather than just naturally

883
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,350
assuming yes it is

884
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,408
cool well I'm gonna be looking around

885
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,479
here in probably outside smoking for the

886
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:18,010
rest of the next half hour and then I'm

887
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,750
about for the rest of the day so feel

888
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,440
free to catch up then cheers thank you

889
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:25,839
very much

890
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,839
[Applause]
