1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,849
what I want to talk about today is our

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,959
digital threat and our service which is

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:15,639
called the emergency VPN I'll start with

4
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:21,970
telling you something about myself and

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:24,130
our project so right now I'm a full-time

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:28,450
researcher at the Czech Technical

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:32,259
University in Prague I do anything

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:35,980
InfoSec related mostly network traffic

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:41,530
analyst analysis I'll actually start my

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,669
masters in October in AI so the stuff

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,690
that I'll talk about

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:49,120
that's a effort of our team there which

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:54,099
is called the civil sphere project it's

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:58,390
led by Veronica Valero's and our goal is

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,639
to help the civil society help them

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,510
protect themselves from digital threats

17
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:08,880
and attacks so basically we try to

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:13,439
provide tools and services for

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:20,560
journalists NGOs and such to help them

20
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:23,628
detect and prevent digital threats so

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,629
[Music]

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:33,579
simply what is the emergency VPN project

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,189
let's say someone contacts us someone

24
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:39,100
who's not sure whether his phone has

25
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:40,779
been compromised or whether everything

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,679
is all right

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:47,950
we tell them to use our VPN for some

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:52,270
amount of time and based on the traffic

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:57,210
that we see we then can say if

30
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:59,770
something's wrong with the phone so

31
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,178
first of all I'll ask you a couple of

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,740
questions so the questions that are

33
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:09,190
important when we're talking about

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:13,150
digital threats mainly mainly network

35
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:16,400
security related so which one of you

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:21,739
were a target of digital attack

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,080
ever I'm sure I'm sure everyone probably

38
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:28,099
has and that's really important to

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,670
realize that anyone using a mobile

40
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:34,280
device anyone connecting and interacting

41
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:38,089
will eventually be a target of some

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:45,049
attack now another question which tested

43
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:48,769
this one is who might attack us and why

44
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:52,400
so for us when we deal with the civil

45
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:55,459
society usually the attacks would be

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,190
targeted targeted once there is a person

47
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,180
with valuable information and someone is

48
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,129
trying to specifically attack them

49
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,730
compromise their device get their

50
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:10,209
location anything really but that's not

51
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,390
always the case most of the attacks

52
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:16,489
actually are not targeted to a person

53
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:20,029
but it's just hackers trying to infect

54
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:22,700
your device getting access to your

55
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,720
mobile banking application or just

56
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:30,649
spreading them out malware so the last

57
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:35,989
question obvious one is how do you

58
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:40,370
defend yourself well you can't really

59
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:42,769
ever be sure that you're safe 100% when

60
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,769
you're interacting and you're connecting

61
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:48,650
to other devices using the Internet you

62
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:52,310
can never be sure I mean sure you can

63
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:55,910
set up a firewall you might use an

64
00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:01,370
anti-virus application which might help

65
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:05,180
you but it might not so one thing that

66
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:09,069
is important to note when you're trying

67
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:12,500
to defend yourself from these threats is

68
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:16,690
to know where does your network traffic

69
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:21,228
flow so as you can see on the picture

70
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:25,139
when you connect to a Wi-Fi right or

71
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:28,139
okay let's say to any server to Facebook

72
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,990
so how it starts you're probably

73
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,919
connected to the Wi-Fi so anyone here

74
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,590
who is also connected to the Wi-Fi can

75
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:42,139
look at your traffic intercept it modify

76
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:48,659
it then the traffic goes to probably

77
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:51,659
several routers to the ISP everyone that

78
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:53,840
has access to that traffic can intercept

79
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:57,990
it look at it modify it

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,409
now obviously the traffic goes through

81
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,719
other routers there's people who have

82
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:10,229
access to those until it reaches the

83
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:15,210
server now VPN might help

84
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:16,919
it creates encrypted tunnel which makes

85
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:21,688
sure that all of your traffic is

86
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:24,120
encrypted but that is up to all the way

87
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:26,759
up to the VPN provider as you can see

88
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,909
the green line represents the encrypted

89
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,029
tunnel or the encryption but after that

90
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:38,819
there's still people that can access and

91
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:46,849
look at the traffic right so emergency

92
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:50,909
VPN it is a VPN it is our free security

93
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:55,770
service the goal is to detect digital

94
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:59,159
threats and attacks we analyze the

95
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:03,688
traffic manually there's some tools that

96
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:06,930
do some automatic analysis but basically

97
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:10,219
when we look at the traffic we should

98
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,580
understand each packet that went through

99
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:15,810
now

100
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,680
as I already told you we we focus on

101
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:24,599
people at risk which might be

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:27,060
journalists lawyers anyone not from the

103
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,550
business sector who doesn't have a

104
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,789
dedicated security team doesn't have the

105
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,680
budget but is still at a great risk and

106
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,589
deals with valuable information so

107
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,730
that's what we focus it on and usually

108
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:42,600
the service we

109
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,760
provide it for three days so we captured

110
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,230
traffic for three days

111
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:52,349
that's usually what we think the

112
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:58,130
sufficient time to see all the traffic

113
00:06:52,350 --> 00:07:01,530
from the main applications and yeah so

114
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:06,330
basically how does it work someone

115
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:10,349
contacts us we tell them to connect to

116
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:14,219
our VPN we provide the necessary the

117
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:17,220
information and when a person wants to

118
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,280
connect to besides Liverpool first it

119
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,610
will connect to our server the Czech

120
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,359
Technical University we capture the

121
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:35,850
traffic there and then we make a copy of

122
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:37,950
the traffic and we send it along so

123
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,310
behind-the-scenes how it works it's

124
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:45,800
basically a Python tool we use the

125
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:49,290
twisted engine as the little maze snake

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:54,990
we use that to handle the networking

127
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:59,720
events and the evpn manager interacts

128
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:03,990
with the open with a Open VPN server and

129
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,480
manages the profile creation exploration

130
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:10,440
and all the all the stuff that's

131
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:13,230
necessary it also interacts with a mail

132
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:18,540
server retrieves data from there and

133
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:23,130
sends automated messages so the timeline

134
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:27,870
will look like that person asks us for

135
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:30,810
an emergency VPN profile we retrieve the

136
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:34,860
email we use the domainkeys identified

137
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:38,070
mail mail method to authenticate the

138
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,940
person we create the profile the open

139
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:44,850
VPN profile and then we start the

140
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,310
traffic capture we automatically send

141
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,220
the profile to the person and this is

142
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,380
where the three days start we capture

143
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,550
the traffic for three days

144
00:08:52,380 --> 00:09:01,910
after that we revoked the profile and we

145
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:05,520
let the user know and here is when oh

146
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:09,020
the analysis comes in so we take the

147
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,360
traffic it's usually a peek app and we

148
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:15,689
use different tools for the analysis you

149
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,410
might recognize some of them so the I

150
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:25,050
that's a logo for Zeke formerly known as

151
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:28,650
bro it's a it's a tool that helps with

152
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:33,089
network analysis there's also some of

153
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:35,250
our own some of the tools that our

154
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,740
friends at stratosphere project

155
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,680
developed which the one in the middle

156
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,080
that's called the stratosphere Linux

157
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,760
intrusion prevention system basically

158
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:52,080
uses machine learning techniques to find

159
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:58,050
the suspicious behavior and and such and

160
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:01,920
then manatee that's the sea cow sea cow

161
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,750
logo that web-based tool to help us

162
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,770
analyze some of the traffic makes sense

163
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:12,360
of for example the logs generated by bro

164
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:17,460
and then sir kata the intrusion

165
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:20,400
prevention engine and of course I'm sure

166
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:23,640
a lot of you know Wireshark for packet

167
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:28,260
analysis who want to really go really

168
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,660
deeply and see the details so all of the

169
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,170
traffic that we see is generated by

170
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:38,100
applications right it's either native

171
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:44,969
applications or once externally

172
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:48,110
installed now we so we usually see the

173
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:52,250
some vulnerabilities there some issues

174
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:57,800
and when we seen that in the traffic we

175
00:10:52,250 --> 00:11:02,100
try to go a step further and basically

176
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,609
see how secure the application is not

177
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,130
only looking at a profile or some car

178
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,560
of a traffic from a user so the question

179
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,240
always arises with all of the

180
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,869
applications that the person uses

181
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:21,840
they're generated generating the traffic

182
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:25,410
how secure are they to use right now the

183
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:29,820
main issue that we usually deal with is

184
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,469
not an infected phone right someone that

185
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,080
would have a spyware or malware

186
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,090
installed we can clearly see it in the

187
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:43,350
traffic we tell the person what to do

188
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:46,080
it's usually data leaking data literally

189
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:51,380
all over the place from applications

190
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:55,200
that are do not have a malicious intent

191
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:57,350
so it's usually due to the lack of

192
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,750
encryption or bad

193
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:06,300
TLS implementation TLS handling for

194
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:10,530
example no certificate validation or

195
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:15,449
such so imagine a GPS location leaking

196
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:19,230
in real time if there's a person with

197
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:22,230
let's say journalists with important

198
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:25,320
data right valuable data and there's

199
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:29,880
someone targeting the person trying to

200
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,310
find them one packet with a GPS location

201
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:36,780
might be the difference between life and

202
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:39,300
death for the person and that doesn't

203
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,459
stop there um from the applications that

204
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,930
we tested we found out that there were

205
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:47,880
emails passwords leaking unique

206
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,969
identifiers and just from the

207
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,670
applications that we tested we know that

208
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:00,360
there are millions of users affected by

209
00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:02,819
these issues so the process when we look

210
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,510
at these applications always want to see

211
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,780
how secure the application is and we do

212
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:13,860
it by looking at the network traffic

213
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:16,800
it's obviously not an analysis of the

214
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,110
of the of every security aspect of the

215
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,380
application we look mainly at the at

216
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:25,500
network traffic and so we look at the

217
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:29,700
traffic we see the vulnerabilities and

218
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:32,040
optionally we try to attack them as an

219
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,210
attacker would in a real world

220
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:41,040
environment the methodology we route the

221
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:44,160
traffic through our computer from a

222
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,599
phone usually we select the application

223
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,089
and we use it as a normal user would

224
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,190
then we identify the issues and

225
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:58,290
vulnerabilities if there are some there

226
00:13:53,190 --> 00:14:00,990
usually are because we already kind of

227
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:04,380
have suspicions from our from our

228
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,860
previous analysis so when we see these

229
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,290
issues we exploit them using mended

230
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,440
middle attacks injection techniques

231
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,930
different different methods and after

232
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,510
that we always document all the findings

233
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:23,459
and we communicate with the developers

234
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:25,800
try to make them aware of the of those

235
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:29,760
issues and hopefully sometimes we even

236
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:34,140
collaborate in fixing those issues those

237
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:41,520
vulnerabilities now I have a live demo

238
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:45,500
for you it's example from an application

239
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:49,730
this is I would say the most popular

240
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:54,090
transport application in Czech Republic

241
00:14:49,730 --> 00:15:01,650
so pretty much yeah everyone knows about

242
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:05,430
it and so well what I have here I'll

243
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:09,300
have two phones here one where I'll show

244
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:13,099
you how it works normally how the

245
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:16,160
application should work and another one

246
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,150
with the victims phone

247
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:27,300
hh-how intercept the traffic and try

248
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:29,510
attack the user so let me let me set it

249
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,510
up

250
00:15:50,420 --> 00:16:01,490
so this is how the application looks

251
00:15:53,579 --> 00:16:07,560
like now imagine Lonardo dicaprio is

252
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:09,470
coming into Prague he he's on his film

253
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,680
tour trying to promote this film and

254
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:15,959
continues to the next largest city in

255
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:21,660
Czech Republic which is below from

256
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:24,540
Prague to Brno so me the attacker

257
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,639
I don't want lonardo to go to Brno I

258
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,349
know that he's using this application

259
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:33,990
and I'll try to get him to go to my

260
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,990
hometown to promote his film there so I

261
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:41,339
can meet him there so how it works a

262
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:45,720
person selects where he is

263
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:52,470
so just Prague and the destination which

264
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:57,209
would be but no so the user searches for

265
00:16:52,470 --> 00:17:03,269
best options this is what it looks like

266
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:06,178
there's a train from Prague to Brno you

267
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:17,449
can click and see the details of the

268
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:21,919
connection so you can see the map - so

269
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:21,919
right here is Prague

270
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:38,050
is Bernard and here is the city is my

271
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:47,190
hometown where I'm trying to get low

272
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:47,190
nada right so let's let's see the attack

273
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,210
[Music]

274
00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:09,280
okay my another device is not working

275
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:17,100
exactly at the right time so let me try

276
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:17,100
to attack this phone so

277
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,400
[Music]

278
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:19,030
let's see if it works oh so right now

279
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,280
I'm low Nardo trying to get from proc

280
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:27,940
okay

281
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:33,740
sorry for that trying to get from proc -

282
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:41,450
but no now I'll try to see the best

283
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:55,780
options okay the that's the problem with

284
00:19:41,450 --> 00:20:05,030
live demos oh yeah okay so I actually

285
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:07,720
will have to show you a video because so

286
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:11,629
we work with the developers and the

287
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:15,559
application that I had here is actually

288
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:26,169
the one that has not been fixed and the

289
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:26,168
other ones fixed fortunately but yeah so

290
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,750
so yeah this is how it works

291
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:47,990
see

292
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:56,350
so here Lonardo choose from his location

293
00:20:47,990 --> 00:21:03,039
to learn oh right and I

294
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:10,330
as an attacker i intercepted the traffic

295
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:13,480
and changed the the destination so the

296
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,949
person gets different results so you can

297
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:22,330
see here that the destination is home

298
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:24,250
poets my hometown but I added that you

299
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:31,658
know the user shouldn't worry that it's

300
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:35,500
a part of Brno so now Leonardo might be

301
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:40,990
suspicious so he looks at the details of

302
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:44,799
the connection or the map so here as an

303
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:51,880
attacker i intercepted the traffic again

304
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:54,460
and I returned the original map or the

305
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,820
original route so now when Leonardo

306
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:01,059
looks where he's going from and where

307
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:09,280
he's where he's going to it would be

308
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:13,530
Prague and Bernal again so yeah you can

309
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,530
see that it goes from Prague to Brno and

310
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:22,860
if Leonardo wants to look at the best

311
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,230
options cuz but it is running out and

312
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:31,059
the the best price is usually what he'll

313
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:36,669
take so here is where i intercepted the

314
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:39,450
traffic again and i changed the price so

315
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:45,390
it says that it's for free you know

316
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:45,390
Czech people are so nice so yeah

317
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,750
so how was I able to do that what was

318
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,170
the issue

319
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,490
[Music]

320
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,040
so the first there were two

321
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,970
vulnerabilities I exploited the first

322
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:05,210
one there was no certificate validation

323
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,580
for an important host who handled most

324
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,880
of the important connections in the

325
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:14,899
application so I was able to perform the

326
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:18,380
man-in-the-middle attack I exchanged the

327
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,080
certificates the application didn't

328
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:26,960
check if the certificate is actually got

329
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:29,030
coming from CR WS and I eventually got

330
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,870
the key was able to decrypt the traffic

331
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:35,990
and encrypted it decrypt modify and

332
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:40,689
encrypt back again second vulnerability

333
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:44,720
is there was a lack of encryption for

334
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:47,330
some options in the applications which

335
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,820
I'll show you later this is how it

336
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:56,120
looked in detail you can see that the

337
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:58,760
request is a CPS it's encrypted but you

338
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,699
could still see see everything that's

339
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,640
happening here so this would be when a

340
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:10,460
person logs into the application there

341
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:14,930
is an email and a password the response

342
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:17,660
to that would have a unique ID for the

343
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:23,060
user and the name and the surname of the

344
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:25,850
user this is how this is what the

345
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,379
attacker was changing so here is the

346
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:32,780
current location of the user and I

347
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:35,920
changed the destination so the server

348
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:39,379
gives me a different result

349
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,410
the response which could which was

350
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,960
altered to I changed the price there you

351
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:51,680
can see the options that are displayed

352
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:54,290
to the user and this is the second

353
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:59,600
vulnerability that's the unencrypted

354
00:24:54,290 --> 00:25:04,990
just HTTP connection which reveals

355
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,990
again the name and the email of the user

356
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:16,428
so that was the vulnerability in this

357
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:19,250
one specific application right but as we

358
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:21,860
test it more of them we realized that

359
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:25,669
it's actually a widespread problem it's

360
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:29,389
not just one application for example be

361
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:33,919
a coma Sega argentinian application

362
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:37,520
developed or yeah developed by visited

363
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,549
the government of when Osiris it had

364
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:44,210
similar issues as it owes leaking the

365
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:48,740
location of the user and a lot other

366
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:51,860
information but they were not encrypting

367
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:55,970
anything actually and the same goes to

368
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:59,719
for the movie application which claims

369
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:04,039
to have several hundred millions of

370
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:07,760
users with similar issues lack of

371
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:11,150
encryption and other for example whether

372
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:15,470
applications or Romanian application for

373
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:18,020
taxi all of them leaking location and

374
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:26,049
other important information about the

375
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:30,260
user so the takeaways the first

376
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:32,150
obviously mobile applications are not as

377
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,690
secure as you might think you can't

378
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:38,809
really see if the if the connections

379
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:42,350
that are going out are encrypted or not

380
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:45,010
and it's not just one stream it's

381
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:47,899
different hosts different ones for

382
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:51,408
advertisement service different ones for

383
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:55,039
different vendor service it is

384
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:58,039
definitely not a good idea to

385
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:02,000
underestimate these risks especially for

386
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:05,270
people dealing with valuable data as I

387
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:11,919
already told you one packet with the GPS

388
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,918
location might make a huge difference so

389
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:18,080
looking at network traffic can tell you

390
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,490
a lot about the security of the

391
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:27,230
application so thank you for your time

392
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:51,680
and now it's the time if you have any

393
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:55,520
questions yes yes so it's an ongoing

394
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:59,930
project we already analyzed I'd say

395
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:04,520
close to probably a hundred profiles so

396
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:06,980
a hundred people approximately yeah

397
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,590
around that number contacted as we

398
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:13,510
analyzed the traffic and yeah we work

399
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:16,580
with that no that's completely free

400
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:20,240
that's part of the project that we do

401
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:24,260
all of the services that we do are for

402
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,290
free and the focused on people for

403
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,360
focused on people at risk and you can

404
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:33,260
actually find the source code and on

405
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:48,409
github so anyone can provide the similar

406
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:52,580
service no problem so the VPN works with

407
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:56,210
the Open VPN server so how it's used is

408
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:59,929
a person uses the open VPN app and we

409
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:02,900
just send him the profile so the user

410
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:06,200
imports the profile to the application

411
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,480
and just starts the VPN so it works for

412
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,640
three days and then the user receives an

413
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,910
email the profiles not gonna work

414
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,980
anymore and he stops using it and after

415
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,980
some time we send him the results

416
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:31,280
we expire the profile so in your phone

417
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:34,400
you receive the profile that's valid for

418
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,480
three days after that you're not going

419
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,670
to be able to connect to the VPN so

420
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,390
anyone can keep the profile but it's not

421
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:50,470
gonna work

422
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:50,470
does that answer your question okay yeah

423
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:58,070
well so how it works in the application

424
00:29:54,530 --> 00:30:01,370
you import the you can import several

425
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:05,030
different profiles right and for that

426
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:08,389
time yeah it is the default one but we

427
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:10,940
kind of give instructions for the people

428
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,760
to know that it's imported there for

429
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:27,290
three days but after that it's no longer

430
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:33,920
of any use a hacker if the hacker had

431
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:35,899
the profile of a different user if the

432
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,420
hacker had the profile of a different

433
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:44,080
user would probably be able to connect

434
00:30:38,420 --> 00:31:18,530
to the VPN but he would not be able to

435
00:30:44,080 --> 00:31:21,169
decrypt the traffic so yeah right so it

436
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,080
is the default one but it's no longer

437
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:27,260
working so it's not really a

438
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,330
vulnerability because the hacker can use

439
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,330
it the user can use it I mean it's just

440
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,199
there

441
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:38,659
it's yeah no one can exploit it and no

442
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,660
one can use it so that that's the idea

443
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:51,540
okay

444
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:57,360
yes if someone lives somewhere where

445
00:31:51,540 --> 00:32:01,110
this is blocked we we haven't we haven't

446
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,350
had that problem yet so we would

447
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:07,020
probably try to solve it at that time

448
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:09,750
with some you know and with a different

449
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,230
proxy or something but we haven't gotten

450
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:20,610
into that problem so I don't really know

451
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:25,920
yeah right

452
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:28,860
so ideally if you if you do a little bit

453
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,800
of traffic analysis if you can look at

454
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:35,010
the traffic yourself it might be fun to

455
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,620
just you know create a hotspot from your

456
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,810
computer connect with your phone there

457
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,540
and then just start up at Wireshark and

458
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:45,870
I don't know for starters you can just

459
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:48,300
look at all the HCP that's going through

460
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:51,300
and just go through our applications

461
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:54,750
play with them and you can get an idea I

462
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:57,110
mean for example the apps the transport

463
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,910
applications you just turn them on and

464
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:02,330
you see a lot of data coming out

465
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:06,090
immediately so that might be one thing

466
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:09,810
second I mean a VPN might help it

467
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:15,060
encrypts the traffic so like you're safe

468
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:16,950
on public Wi-Fi should be safe so yeah I

469
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:27,840
would recommend looking at your traffic

470
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:30,150
probably yeah I mean I ideally so the

471
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,600
process for an application to get fixed

472
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:37,230
it's really like it really varies might

473
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,230
be a couple days but for example for the

474
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:44,260
App Store there's some kind of a process

475
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:49,390
before a new version can be deployed so

476
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:51,460
that would take more time so yeah from

477
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:54,460
my personal experience I just uninstall

478
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:58,120
the applications and when we actually do

479
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:01,290
a proper analysis and a report we try to

480
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:14,109
fix them but I don't I don't use them

481
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:16,989
yes okay yeah so that's that really

482
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:21,369
varies it really depends on the

483
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:23,739
individual company I mean I understand

484
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:25,419
that if if it's just a small team of

485
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:28,899
developers they don't really have any

486
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:30,790
one or the budget to take care of the

487
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:36,668
security someone pentesting the

488
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:41,070
application and such so it might be like

489
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:44,739
an added problem and some face it with

490
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:48,520
like some what's basically say thank you

491
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:51,219
can you help us fix it give us all all

492
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:54,730
the issues basically do a pen test and

493
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:58,839
we can fix it together some would

494
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:01,510
probably more look at the marketing side

495
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:05,250
of it so when we release our blogs or

496
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:08,560
reports about these vulnerabilities they

497
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:12,510
basically care just about their names

498
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:16,480
who they try to patch some of the

499
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:20,400
vulnerabilities but they usually don't

500
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,500
do a good job so it's really about the

501
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,600
about how the developers about their

502
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,900
approach if it's more marketing wise

503
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:33,160
it's highly probable that they'll patch

504
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:35,590
some of the issues which will possibly

505
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,710
come up back again in another version

506
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:41,230
but there are genuinely some developers

507
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:43,060
that really communicate with us and try

508
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:47,190
to get a new version out as soon as

509
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,190
possible so yeah

510
00:35:48,820 --> 00:36:24,800
yeah it's definitely about trust I'm not

511
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,470
sure if I understand completely but

512
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,440
definitely the relationship between the

513
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:33,500
users of the VPN and us is about trust

514
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:36,710
that with that helps the fact that we're

515
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,850
kind of like we're working under the

516
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:42,880
Czech Technical University which has

517
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:46,250
some name for itself I would say like

518
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,220
people can trust the institution maybe

519
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,470
and also the fact that we don't do it

520
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,750
for money we do it as a part of our

521
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:58,069
research so when it's not a business

522
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:00,470
it's not as a interest for us to sell

523
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:02,720
the vulnerabilities to anyone our goal

524
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,390
is mainly to protect the people we work

525
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,049
with so that's the idea and of course

526
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:11,330
it's about trust and people having to

527
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:23,450
trust us that we're gonna deal with the

528
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:25,810
data appropriately yeah I'm sorry say

529
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:40,910
that again please

530
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:43,130
yeah yeah okay so the question was with

531
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,170
the users with the users that we deal

532
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,900
with what were what were the

533
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:51,380
vulnerabilities and the issues they're

534
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:54,970
mostly so I can say mostly from my own

535
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:59,420
experience I don't really look at other

536
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:00,560
analysis so from what I've experienced

537
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,240
there's always

538
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,120
is data leakage I haven't really come

539
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,339
across a user that would have a device

540
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,069
that's completely safe there's no data

541
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:16,370
leaking that's the number one issue that

542
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:21,070
I come across second there were some

543
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:24,770
Edward that I came across I never really

544
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:27,950
experienced the user with hack phone so

545
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,940
like malware or stock where something

546
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:35,480
like something like that

547
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:38,890
so that's from my experience yeah okay

548
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,500
so thank you all very much

549
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,500
[Applause]
