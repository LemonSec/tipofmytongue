00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,890
panel and what only 30 minutes over not

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,090
bad

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,520
since we started 9 o'clock this morning

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,780
those of us who are here at half 7:00

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,509
has an even longer day

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,760
I'm before we kind of start with this

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,080

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,570
thank-yous I'm it is actually been a

13
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:40,358
bloody brilliant b-sides and even as an

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,670
organizer I recognize a good b-sides so

15
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:44,589
I think when we go through this just

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,510
kind of think about your place in the

17
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,949
day whether you've been a goon whether

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,539
you've been in a talk

19
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:51,309
whether you're given a talk whether

20
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,989
you're on a panel and now having to

21
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:56,498
suffer some Twitter abuse at the moment

22
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:58,239
does it really matter this has been a

23
00:00:56,499 --> 00:01:00,039
really good b-side and let's go through

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,099
this now as quick as we can so we can

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,710
get to the beer so it didn't go to plan

26
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,210
there have been some issues along the

27
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,089
way we've had speakers who pulled out

28
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,130

29
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,119

30
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,119

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,079
actually for those who did the workshops

74
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,180
