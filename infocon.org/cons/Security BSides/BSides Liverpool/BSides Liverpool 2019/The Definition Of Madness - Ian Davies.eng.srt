1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,570
welcome to b-sides Liverpool and the

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,399
rookie track my name is Ian

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:15,019
I nameless taught the definition of

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,210
madness most of you some of you will

5
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:18,710
have heard the phrase the definition of

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,030
madness is doing the same thing over and

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,869
over again expecting different results

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:26,060
and although I've only been doing this

9
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,100
for a very short time I did my first

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,390
intersect qualification last year at

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:35,420
this time last year I have run across

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,789
the same behaviors in the last 12 months

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:42,409
and it seems a bit strange to me so

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:46,550
before we get into the detail of that a

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:50,449
little bit about me so I worked on my

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:53,120
first computer in 1980 I worked on my

17
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:57,620
first industrial system in 1987 I did my

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,288
first IT qualification in 1989 I've had

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,708
roles in the military in small business

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:06,530
a little business with 30 plus employees

21
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:10,070
I've worked in education both as a

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,680
technician and as a lecturer and I now

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,490
work for a builders merchant group with

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,050
businesses across four countries for

25
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,820
those of you that weren't around in the

26
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,990
80s that's the first computer I ever

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,729
played with I didn't own it it was owned

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,800
by the RAF and we had it in a computer

29
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:31,040
Club and we used to do programming basic

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,479
on it I said we programmed basic on it

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,430
we probably spent more try and keep the

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,110
more time keeping the memory pack in the

33
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,130
back than we did actually programming it

34
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,780
but that's a story for a different day

35
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,089
that's the first industrial system I

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,080
ever worked on it's a Ferranti August

37
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,659
500 it was an industrial control system

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,600
the very variant that I used was I had a

39
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,390
choral 66 compiler and we used it for a

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,580
private military messaging system but

41
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,850
the storage was one inch mag tape and it

42
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:06,060
booted from punched paper tape so

43
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,449
I've been doing it for a while but about

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,390
a year ago I was asked to go and do this

45
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:16,049
qualification by the company that I now

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,390
work for and actually I haven't I've got

47
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,670
the the reaction that I got when I gave

48
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,869
this talk somewhere else

49
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,700
but I have found that they get quite a

50
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,120
negative reaction for this from this

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:31,440
qualification quite frequently I was

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,300
really excited to go umm I actually

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,310
really enjoyed the course bearing in

54
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,890
mind that I'd been doing IT for the best

55
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,790
part of 30 or more years before I got

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,920
there and I came home with full of

57
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,950
enthusiasm or wanting to learn more and

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,470
do more and get more involved but

59
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,079
actually I found that I was pretty well

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,290
ignored by the people that I could reach

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,670
out to I didn't know any of you guys the

62
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,459
only people I could reach out to were on

63
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,170
social media and the easiest form of

64
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,420
that spoke social media was LinkedIn and

65
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:08,399
Twitter but I really didn't get anywhere

66
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,899
at all and I was ignored I was put down

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,940
because of the qualification that I'd

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,799
done which had sparked this interest I

69
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,959
said on there that I was ridiculed on it

70
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,269
I think actually probably now that's a

71
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,760
bit harsh it wasn't me that was being

72
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:24,269
ridiculed it was that ceh qualification

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,828
that I'd done and as a consequence of

74
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,570
all that I found it very difficult to

75
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:31,290
get any help or guidance or any

76
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:34,769
direction on where to go and I was quite

77
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,690
surprised at that for me what I learned

78
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,110
on that course lots of really good

79
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,480
positive things I learnt what data our

80
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,760
systems leaked I learnt what we could do

81
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,488
with that data and how we can then use

82
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,709
that to exploit the systems I saw

83
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,690
examples of lateral movement which never

84
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,010
had explained to me before I've never

85
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,680
seen past the hash

86
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,480
I'd never seen many cats working but I

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,820
was able to see all of that in real time

88
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,670
actually doing it we launched the

89
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,470
ransomware we built root kits and I even

90
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,630
played with Metasploit and yes it was

91
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,919
all done on vulnerable XP machines but

92
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:14,459
it demonstrated what's possible and that

93
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,200
for me was will open my eyes after 30 or

94
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,149
more years doing infrastructure

95
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,349
to what was possible and nobody had ever

96
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,320
explained this or showed this to me

97
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,300
before

98
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:33,930
anywhere in any of the roles I'd ever

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:38,490
had so when I got home and I tried to

100
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:43,560
learn more this is what generally I got

101
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:47,880
told everybody I spoke to said that I

102
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,190
needed to go into a osep that was it I'd

103
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,960
done this certified ethical hacking it

104
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,190
was rubbish it wasn't worth the paper it

105
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,039
was printed on you need to go and do

106
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,890
osep if you want to be an ethical hacker

107
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,710
but the distance between starting out an

108
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,340
info sack and starting out with a CH and

109
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,680
actually doing OS CP was enormous and I

110
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,119
had no idea about what journey I needed

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:16,680
to take or how I would get there it

112
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,470
wasn't at all helpful and for a long

113
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,870
period of time or a few months after I

114
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:25,860
came away from from Dublin with that

115
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:30,420
that piece of paper I really struggled

116
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,680
because I started to question I started

117
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,570
to question whether I should have known

118
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,800
some of this stuff whether I should have

119
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,900
already known it I'd been doing it for

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,580
30 or more years should I already have

121
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,419
known about it should I already have

122
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:45,180
understood it where should I be in my

123
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,800
career it seemed a bit odd that I'd

124
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,210
managed to go all of this time and not

125
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,030
know any of this stuff and I started to

126
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,250
talk to some of the guys that I worked

127
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,380
with I started to talk to some of the

128
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,480
guys that had been in the RAF with I

129
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,219
even talked to some of the suppliers

130
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,980
that we work with and their IT teams

131
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,220
with good relationships with and it it

132
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,410
turned out actually that they all had a

133
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,260
similar knowledge gap they were all

134
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:16,020
focused sis admins they were all focused

135
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,420
on delivering infrastructure and keeping

136
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,789
it up and running but with very very

137
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,070
little understanding of information

138
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,380
security or cyber security or just the

139
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,120
infrastructure security in general they

140
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,800
would do some stuff with Active

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,490
Directory but they didn't understand

142
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,530
beyond

143
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,520
lying things that could be exploited

144
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:38,159
they had no idea how breaches occur very

145
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,240
little idea of how witches occur how

146
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,770
vulnerabilities are exploited and more

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,870
importantly I think very few of them

148
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,909
realized that lots of what they needed

149
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,340
was freely available on the web with

150
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,900
YouTube tutorials and and actually you

151
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,739
could set yourself up as a little script

152
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,289
Kitty in about five minutes and that

153
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,780
helped me and I decided to go and do

154
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:03,180
some more research about that and so I

155
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,159
looked around again I only had contacts

156
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,729
on social media I only been doing it for

157
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:12,060
six or seven months by this time but I

158
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:15,900
found some quite a telling posts on

159
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,180
various social media outlets and this

160
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,789
lady at the top her lady called Cassie

161
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,710
in this state and she was told that she

162
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,690
wasn't cut out for InfoSec because she

163
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,479
was asking for people to go and study

164
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,039
with she wanted to study with other

165
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,539
people that was the way she learnt best

166
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,240
but she was told that she'd never make

167
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,729
it in InfoSec because she wanted to do

168
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,070
that which it's a very negative approach

169
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,870
there's like I don't quite understand

170
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,719
why you would say that but that was the

171
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,330
feedback that she got I gave this talk

172
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:47,840
of besides London a few weeks ago and

173
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,130
after the talk a chap came up to me and

174
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,169
he shared with me this other comment

175
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,469
he's asked me not to put his name on it

176
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:57,479
which i think is is telling in its own

177
00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:01,860
way that he didn't want to be identified

178
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:05,039
but he went to a security conference as

179
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,599
an IT admin and he was interested in

180
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,849
getting into information security but

181
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,030
the consultancy told him that most IT

182
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:14,819
admins don't make it in security which

183
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,229
again seems a bit strange who shouldn't

184
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,900
we be encouraging them in and not

185
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:22,409
telling them they can't ever do it it's

186
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,750
a bit it does seem a bit bizarre to me

187
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,520
I don't know how many of you know about

188
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:31,560
malicious or no malicious and C is an ex

189
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,020
teacher and I've worked in education

190
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,120
I've taught and Fe I've worked in

191
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,699
education as a as a technician and I've

192
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,440
also been a school governor but there is

193
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,160
a different approach there's a much more

194
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,540
collegiate approach in education to

195
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,660
making sure that we keep our

196
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,339
professional development I worked in a

197
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,140
secondary school for five years and in

198
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,300
that five years every Thursday morning

199
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,090
the whole staff would go to the staff

200
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,310
room before school started and one

201
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,350
department would do a presentation on

202
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,969
some best practice or something that

203
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,040
they'd done or some obstacle that they'd

204
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,110
overcome and we did that every Thursday

205
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,569
morning for 38 weeks of the year every

206
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,270
year for five years so I was getting

207
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,390
that professional development for free

208
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,730
we were sharing that amongst can you

209
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,230
imagine how much training and

210
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,970
professional element we could get if we

211
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,560
could get the helpdesk the devs and the

212
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,230
SIS admins together for half an hour

213
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,780
every week and just get one or other of

214
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,580
them to share some best practice but we

215
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,740
don't do it we don't admit that we don't

216
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,630
know things or we find it hard to admit

217
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,520
we don't know things and this idea of we

218
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,640
can't admit it we just need to try

219
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,380
harder really in my opinion we need to

220
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,340
change that approach we need to change

221
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,950
the attitude

222
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,340
try harder has a place but it's places

223
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,300
in osep it's not in the wider

224
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:56,400
information security of cybersecurity

225
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:59,160
domain if we can't talk to each other

226
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,930
and help each other and admit that we

227
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,910
don't know something or ask questions

228
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,660
about how we might understand something

229
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:09,000
better how do we expect our helpdesk

230
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,100
operators or our developers or our sis

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,130
admins to come and ask us for help or

232
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,930
ask us to explain things are we making

233
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,460
ourselves approachable to those people

234
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,329
who really need to know because they're

235
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:23,230
the guys that need to implement it

236
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,820
to many of these people don't know about

237
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,670
these things too many of them don't know

238
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,160
about reconnaissance they they don't

239
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:35,030
know about enumeration assessment

240
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,969
exploit they are just oblivious to what

241
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:42,800
goes on in in this world that we that we

242
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:46,070
exist in and it struck me that for many

243
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,630
years I worked with people who just

244
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,090
patched their systems because they were

245
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,380
told to not because they understood why

246
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,050
they were doing it or what the

247
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,760
consequences of not doing it were and we

248
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,329
had a really really good example of that

249
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,890
recently with blue keep so for those of

250
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,360
you that know about blue keep it's a

251
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,740
vulnerability in RDS

252
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:11,480
it's through the Microsoft RDP client

253
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:14,090
and it's probably it's been proposed as

254
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,170
that is the next one a cry if it gets

255
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,550
out in the wild possibly it was

256
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,650
everybody was warning about it Microsoft

257
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,380
released patches for XP and for Windows

258
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:28,100
and for Server 2003 as a pre-emptive

259
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:29,750
thing not as a reactive thing and we

260
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,730
decided in our business that we were

261
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,650
going to found all of our suppliers

262
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,570
anybody who had any connection with our

263
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,620
network we were going to phone them all

264
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,810
up and make sure that they were

265
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,190
proactively doing something about it and

266
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,810
we found this one supplier and they

267
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,360
didn't know anything about it at all and

268
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,609
they outsource all of their IT to

269
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,040
another company we phoned that company

270
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,440
and they said oh they don't take our

271
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,500
patching service so they hadn't even

272
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,420
told them about blue key don't even told

273
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,160
them how dangerous it was because they

274
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:03,560
didn't pay for their patching service

275
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,329
and in the end we convinced them that it

276
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,030
needed to be done and it got done but

277
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,670
it's a it's a bizarre state of affairs

278
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,650
where the security of that business and

279
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,319
an ultimately security of our business

280
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,939
came down to the fact that they didn't

281
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,670
pay for a patching serious in a managed

282
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,460
service provider but the more we spoke

283
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,959
to them actually I don't think the MSP

284
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,010
the senior engineer we had on that call

285
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,180
he didn't understand what bleep was he

286
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,660
didn't understand what that

287
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,979
vulnerability actually did or didn't do

288
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,110
and that's the

289
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,670
was that they were patching on this

290
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,010
cycle because they're told they have to

291
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,550
patch they're not patching because they

292
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:46,340
understand why and we need to help them

293
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,689
learn more we need to be more open

294
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:53,180
last year's course fundamentally changed

295
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,660
my approach to IT security and it drove

296
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,729
me to learn more it's driven me to go to

297
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,650
besides London and driven me to come

298
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,270
here I've only ever been to two

299
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,569
conferences and I've given the talk at

300
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:07,880
two conferences and that's because I did

301
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:11,540
that thing that CH that everybody

302
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,850
ridiculed so much it brought me to this

303
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,939
point today

304
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:20,180
it's a journey InfoSec it never ends

305
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,920
and it's got a start and it's got

306
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,189
multiple destinations and it's got

307
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,260
multiple roads that you can follow how

308
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,060
do you try harder when you don't know

309
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,760
which road you're trying or what you're

310
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:36,010
actually trying this is a really good

311
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:41,960
image which I think shows really well

312
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:46,310
the InfoSec domain and the variations

313
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:49,070
within Infotech so you might be a pen

314
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,079
tester you might be in governance you

315
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,880
might be an operational security you

316
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,400
might be blue team you might be red team

317
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,020
there's all of this stuff this is a mind

318
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,780
map that was tilled by a sea so called

319
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,730
Henry's anger New York and he's very

320
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,589
kindly let me reproduce it and he's put

321
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,210
it on his LinkedIn page as a PDF as a

322
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:12,140
JPEG for anybody who wants to go and

323
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:14,030
download it but it really shows that you

324
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,610
can't just have one approach to

325
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:19,430
information security because it's

326
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,680
different you don't need to code to work

327
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,510
in governance how many times you hear

328
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,969
people say you can't be an InfoSec if

329
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,650
you can't code of course you can you

330
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,150
might not be able to be a pen tester you

331
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,990
can definitely work at information

332
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,610
security but all we do or my experience

333
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,160
is that everybody's giving you reasons

334
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,500
where you can't do it and not finding

335
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,140
ways of helping you to do it and that's

336
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,130
why I'd like to change

337
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:48,890
changing attitudes it's possible it

338
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,620
takes some effort it takes some work

339
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,420
thank you it takes some effort it takes

340
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:58,190
some work it's not going to happen

341
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,890
overnight here's an example in 1980 when

342
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,100
I worked on my first computer

343
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,709
drink-driving

344
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,420
was a bit of a macho challenge we'd go

345
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,709
out we'd have a few pints we drive home

346
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,569
and then the next night we'd go out we'd

347
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:11,029
see I had 10 pints last night I loved 11

348
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,399
tonight drive home but it was a bit of a

349
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:15,890
thing we did I'm not particularly proud

350
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,130
of it but it was it was the way it was

351
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:22,160
Oh wearing seatbelts wasn't compulsory

352
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,339
in fact a lot of cars in 1980 didn't

353
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,910
even have seatbelts in them if the

354
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:30,050
younger of you can even believe that

355
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,670
speeding was never talked about and

356
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,319
there were far less speed limits than I

357
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,510
see now it was never talked about

358
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,010
because it just wasn't a thing you know

359
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,390
you just got in a car you drove you got

360
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,649
home you got back in the car you drove

361
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:44,600
you went to work fast forward that to

362
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,260
2019 drink-driving is completely

363
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,290
unacceptable

364
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,660
very few people now would even think of

365
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,420
having a beer and getting in a car and

366
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,430
driving it we've changed the attitude

367
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,380
it's taken a long time it hasn't quite

368
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,269
taken that amount of time but it took a

369
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,910
long time and a lot of hard work to

370
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:03,769
change the attitudes the same with with

371
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,420
seatbelts it took a long time to get

372
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,550
people for those of you that remember

373
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,469
click click every trip and all that it

374
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,240
took a long time to get people to

375
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,820
actually realize that it was in their

376
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,380
best interest and you know we we have

377
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,610
your car talking to you or beeping at

378
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,740
you now if you don't put your seatbelt

379
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,750
on but you wouldn't really get in a car

380
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,640
and not put your seatbelt on anymore and

381
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,800
speeding now is the new drink driving

382
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,370
we're starting to see changes in those

383
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,390
attitudes we're starting to see people

384
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,070
come in and say oh I've got a speeding

385
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,260
ticket off that camera the other day and

386
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,510
now the answer is logicians have been

387
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,180
speeding them where it's not that long

388
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,430
ago it would have been more likely to be

389
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,069
where are those flippin speed cameras

390
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:46,670
pain in the backside only but we started

391
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,620
to see those attitudes change and so we

392
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,120
can change attitudes if we're willing to

393
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,220
put the effort in if we willing to go

394
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,340
that on the long haul and I think we

395
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,650
should I was Charlie

396
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,070
and when I was preparing this talk for

397
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:05,410
besides London to eat I was it was said

398
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:09,230
to me you're having a bit of a rant so I

399
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,820
am you're having a bit of a rant what

400
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,940
you're gonna do about it how are you

401
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,319
going to change it what your things that

402
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,110
you're gonna do so these were the things

403
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,869
that I came up with I would like to

404
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,939
build a new community where it's it's a

405
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:24,439
shared community it's not just InfoSec

406
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,280
it's where anybody can come in and ask

407
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,720
questions about security but it's a safe

408
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,190
place where you can come in and you can

409
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,110
come in and ask and you won't get

410
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,910
ridiculed and nobody will say you should

411
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,490
have known that and there are always

412
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,470
people who know more than you and there

413
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,060
are always reasons there are always bits

414
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,750
that you don't know nobody can know

415
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,730
everything about everything so it's very

416
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,800
small there's about six of us from

417
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,140
besides London it's not a great

418
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,930
community it needs more of you please

419
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,670
come and join us please share it I will

420
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:59,120
be posting a lot more when we finish

421
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:01,790
here today and I'll share their slack

422
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,219
channel link again as well over the next

423
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:06,320
few weeks several times on Twitter but

424
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,560
please come and join us and talk to us

425
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,500
because without you guys without

426
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,240
starting this off we can't make the

427
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,450
changes that we need to make we need to

428
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,580
be more positive we need to encourage

429
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,680
people in we need to get rid of the

430
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,540
gatekeepers and we need to get rid of

431
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,310
the gatekeeping that goes on and we need

432
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:29,000
to stop saying your cards and start

433
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:35,389
saying you can and so my challenge to

434
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,190
you as seasoned professionals is to be

435
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:41,960
patient with newcomers please and

436
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,570
challenge gatekeeping if you see

437
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,080
gatekeeping behavior challenge it it's

438
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:51,490
it's rife in our industry and we we

439
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,020
really do need to try and root it out

440
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,480
make it acceptable to ask questions

441
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,700
because you've we've all learnt from

442
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,680
somewhere and if even if you spent the

443
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,540
last 30 years teaching yourself because

444
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,210
there wasn't an Infotech community and

445
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,850
you had to hack away and hack away and

446
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,010
hack away for those of you that wondered

447
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:13,179
where the word hacker came

448
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:14,860
from its it do you really need to then

449
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,900
go make other people go and do it the

450
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,959
same way you did it or could you not

451
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,140
just share some of that information and

452
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,920
again

453
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,390
stop putting obstacles in people's way

454
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,640
please don't tell people to try harder

455
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,950
time to try harder if they do no SCP

456
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,260
that's fine you can tell us you try

457
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,970
Google or don't mind that but you can

458
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,480
help them and you can direct them and we

459
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:40,150
can encourage them and and we'll start

460
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,180
to have a wider and a better community

461
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,340
will start to encourage people into our

462
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:49,090
industry and will stop being so

463
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:52,330
exclusive and so elite or maybe that's

464
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:56,169
what you want I don't know but that's my

465
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:59,050
talk and I've been doing it for 12

466
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:02,680
months I started with ch I've ended with

467
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:05,430
2 talks at 2 besides I'm still going on

468
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:08,530
I'm looking for other opportunities and

469
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,180
I hope you will join me and try and

470
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,889
start to change some of these attitudes

471
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,840
that we've seen or at least encourage

472
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,450
people who want to come into our

473
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,030
industry so that we can have an

474
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,850
inclusive industry not an exclusive one

475
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:33,879
and I'll take any questions if you'd

476
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:35,169
like to ask Brian I don't know he didn't

477
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,240
he didn't share the name of the

478
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,900
consultancy with me he posted it on

479
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,220
Twitter after we'd left um he said I did

480
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,620
actually say I really enjoyed you talk

481
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,410
and then obviously put that that tweet

482
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,760
up home and I asked him if I could use

483
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,990
it and he said you can use it well

484
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:58,080
please take my name off it which is

485
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:58,080
which is what I've done anymore

486
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:19,020
i tell you i know ii just take this yep

487
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:21,450
since you are since you would force by

488
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:26,250
your company to do the certified ethical

489
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:29,940
hacking was your company at least in

490
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:31,260
terms of its staff in the same right

491
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,560
after you got your information

492
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,790
did they ended up spreading did you end

493
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:41,760
up spreading your message to your own

494
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:45,180
company Oh s-sorry no we really bad at

495
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,370
it to be fair it's a bit odd because we

496
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,110
have 10 companies 10 IT teams and a lot

497
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,610
of acquisitions and they all do their

498
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,959
own thing and I go out and tell them or

499
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,709
what they've got to do and then try and

500
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,930
enforce it and so it's a bit harder but

501
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:02,630
we're we are fairly immature to be fair

502
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:06,270
as far as security goes and and we are

503
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:08,400
we're getting better for them but we

504
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,710
don't share very well and there's only

505
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,320
me well there's me and two others but

506
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,570
that's that's not a big team to go in to

507
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:21,389
go out sharing with with teams of ten or

508
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:23,550
twelve or more across the business what

509
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,230
we are doing interestingly is we get

510
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,300
into the table at the start of projects

511
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,340
and night at the end that was something

512
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:33,030
that I learnt from a another conference

513
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,470
that I went to and it's got nothing to

514
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:39,420
do with my talk but as you asked the

515
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:41,670
question I went to it I went to I went

516
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,860
to a Palo Alto conference sorry for the

517
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,260
advertising and there was a chap there

518
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,360
who said information security if you

519
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,310
think about building a house you go and

520
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,229
find a piece of land you really like it

521
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:54,300
- ideal - right on the docks in

522
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,740
Liverpool it's the best you know it's

523
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,120
your perfect piece of line for building

524
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,860
your house you go to your architect he

525
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,500
builds up the right shoes you got the

526
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,139
plans done it's the best building is

527
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,970
your ideal home and then you take those

528
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,940
plans to the planning office and they

529
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,440
say you can't do that and we're that

530
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,750
planning office

531
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,150
or we could be we can be that planning

532
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,770
office so they did all of this stuff and

533
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,930
then the security team come along say oh

534
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,710
you can't do that that's not safe that's

535
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,170
not secure

536
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,740
so we get into the table early and

537
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:27,270
working with them to make sure we do

538
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,280
certainly on new stuff anyway try and do

539
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:33,570
the design and build security into the

540
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,280
design whatever that happens to be and

541
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,460
that way we're not the blocker with it

542
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,760
the we in Korea we delivering it with

543
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:47,670
them

544
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:49,620
sorry hey so I I was the infrastructure

545
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:52,290
delivery manager I run a team of eight

546
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:56,070
people who - all of the infrastructure

547
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:59,639
across the UK for all shared services in

548
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,500
a builder's Merchant Group and I've left

549
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,800
that role now to go and do this security

550
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,380
role so I'm I'm just an operational

551
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,510
security and a large part of that is

552
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,460
just making sure that other IT teams do

553
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,170
what they're asked to do or are

554
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:17,220
delivering a level of security that's

555
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:38,390
acceptable to the business there's

556
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:41,880
answer your question any others yeah

557
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,440
yeah yeah so the talk is a we should be

558
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,500
and Corinne's everybody to talk about

559
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,140
security and not making it exclusive so

560
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,540
it's not it's not an exclusive domain it

561
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,130
should be inclusive to everybody and one

562
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,899
of the ways you can do that is to be at

563
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,390
that table when you start those designs

564
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,250
when you star that development I'm

565
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:02,700
there's no point me going and sitting

566
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:05,160
with the dev team because I don't code I

567
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,630
do infrastructure so I go and sit with

568
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,280
the network team and the server team

569
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:13,250
somebody ask goes and sits for the dev

570
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:16,590
teams does that answer your question

571
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,390
anything else anybody else I think

572
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:22,480
that's just about the time up anyway to

573
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:26,239
be fair M thank you very much everybody

574
