00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,119
miss brother much miss brother Mike who

22
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:21,280
passed away at the end of March after a

23
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:23,520
nine-month battle with bowel cancer he

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,539
left a huge hole in everybody's heart

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,060
but I would like you to try and remember

26
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:35,409
Mike for saying wonderful things like

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:37,659
this super I'm not gonna read for you by

28
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:40,869
the way right new that you can manage in

29
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:43,270
he would appreciate that too but he's

30
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:44,830
left a huge hole in our heart and one

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,830
thing that I was kind of hoping that you

32
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,750
would all do for me is maybe after three

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,209
that we could all tell cancer to go and

34
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:57,030
I think he would appreciate a big cheer

35
00:01:52,209 --> 00:02:00,420
of cancer so after three one two three

36
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,420
fuck cancer

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,030
and deep breath you are all very

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,430
privileged because I didn't cry once

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,380

46
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:36,670

complex people we love hacking shit

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,600
that's the obligatory we've seen this

55
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,970
million times we do some very weird

56
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,340
incident responses we do some normal

57
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:10,239
ones but some of them are quite weird

58
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,430
I'm not gonna tell you anything I'm just

59
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,380
gonna leave you like now we do some

60
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,820
defining I'm sorry I mean blue teaming I

61
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,750
believe that's the popular term for

62
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,250
defense nowadays every now and again I

63
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,160
have to speak to some gray beards at

64
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,830
work and the Dave been struggling to get

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,420
their head around what DevOps means

66
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,340
until I explain to them that's what we

67
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,390
used to call in Ex system admins and

68
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,489
they were like oh shit right got ya so

69
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,980
yeah the blue team's of what we call

70
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,680
defending back in the day I spend an

71
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:52,988
ever-increasing amount of time talking

72
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:56,640
about risk no but this is I spend a lot

73
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:59,800
of time talking about recognizing risk

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,059
which is if I have to explain this side

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,600
to you right it's been a very long day

76
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,760
I'm sorry and of course I spend a lot of

77
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,590
time telling people that a lot of risk

78
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,649
is bloody predictable he must have known

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,358
this was going to happen come on who

80
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,099
remembers this story

81
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:23,590
love and of course one of the biggest

82
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:30,460
risks that we deal with mostly is people

83
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:33,818
being dumb I try I try to be patient

84
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,650
very patient but sometimes I just wonder

85
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:39,159
can we try a couple years without the

86
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:43,239
warning labels just maybe maybe we could

87
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:44,530
let the universe helpers oh shit yeah

88
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,360
and one of the weird things that happen

89
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,099
to me is I met my actual to God nemesis

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,020
last week don't worry I will explain

91
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:57,159
it's quite weird I mean I know what a

92
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:01,409
nemesis means and if you don't well let

93
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:04,449
this or it can't explain it to you but I

94
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:06,129
became an interim CTO for a company

95
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,099
recently I've done a lot of work with

96
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:11,319
him for a while so when everything went

97
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:14,199
they called me and called I'll come here

98
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:16,930
in and off we went and I spoke to their

99
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,210
customer care team they didn't feel like

100
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,819
they had much input with the the

101
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,560
technology departments of the company no

102
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,560
great surprise there and that story

103
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,419
right and they spoke to me and I said

104
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,430
hey look tell you what don't mean to

105
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:31,839
sound like a prima donna but I run six

106
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,210
calendars at moment speak to my

107
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,560
assistant and I will we'll sit down and

108
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,758
we'll work this list out get through the

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,509
problems cool no problems so anyway my

110
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,370
colleague came up to me and went you you

111
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,430
you've got an appointment with locally

112
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,310
right I know what know you've got an

113
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:55,810
appointment with someone called locally

114
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:57,279
so enter stage left low key so right

115
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,460
enough my colleague was right I did have

116
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,199
an appointment with low key now the

117
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,089
reason that that might not sound very

118
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,219
interesting to you is it took me a

119
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:08,770
second to realize why my colleague a

120
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:11,860
dust so here is low key put your hands

121
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,620
up if you know who low key is cool right

122
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,449
so as you know I work for a company

123
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,789
called findly I'd say I'm one of the

124
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:23,080
founders of the company so I spoke to

125
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:24,490
link that low key and I said to her we

126
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,459
had the meeting business meeting

127
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,750
conference room she walks in I walk in

128
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,390
assists it is it really low key Oh

129
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,700
loke really yeah sounds fucking

130
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,060
brilliant my colleague was you can send

131
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,880
my colleague recently so why I says well

132
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,760
you know I presume you know the Norse

133
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,330
mythology about your name yeah of course

134
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,880
cool well a vimla we really love Norse

135
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,340
mythology too we've got a fucking we've

136
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,180
got a Viking ship with a logo right we

137
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,219
love it I said so um you might not know

138
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,380
but VIN is actually named after a Norse

139
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,090
God - I said really

140
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,230
which Norse God I said well I'm down and

141
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,489
we both started laughing but I

142
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,560
appreciate that you guys might not know

143
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,080
who might not know the significance

144
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,260
between loci and Heimdall being in the

145
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,520
same room but we kill each other in

146
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:21,950
Ragnarok which is cool and I said to her

147
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,180
at the time I'm like wow it's not often

148
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:28,219
you actually meet your actual nemesis at

149
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,900
work because if you know the Norse

150
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,820
mythology you know that Loki and

151
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,770
Heimdall have been enemies forever and

152
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,080
they kill each other and Ragnarok and

153
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,210
she's like wow that's amazing

154
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,770
it's cool I mean yeah yeah it's cool

155
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,270
obviously we're a bit concerned that

156
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,840
this might be the end of the world but

157
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:49,099
you know bar that how's things going so

158
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,229
I said - look I'm gonna ask you a really

159
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,300
strange question so yeah sure

160
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,940
okay can I take a selfie with you I've

161
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,190
never asked this of someone before and I

162
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,360
know it's a little bit weird it's just

163
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,400
like yeah sure was cool tip selfie and

164
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,740
then I said okay so now the weird part

165
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,620
and so they go that what do you mean the

166
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,540
weird part well and speaking in a

167
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,419
conference in Liverpool and I wondered

168
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:18,380
if I could use the the picture and she's

169
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:21,260
like yeah so everybody this is Loki and

170
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,050
she's promised to leave her sharp things

171
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,150
for me at home on Ragnarok I don't know

172
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,850
us to believe her or not anyway but like

173
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:32,799
I say meeting your nemesis is quite an

174
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,800
interesting thing right so anyway I die

175
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:39,409
Cooper but anyway I digress so what am I

176
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,438
talking about

177
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:46,519
I am talking about Machiavelli's guide

178
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:49,248
to InfoSec or really using yesterday's

179
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,829
knowledge to kind of secure tomorrow's

180
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:53,779
future just for that spin ranges I feel

181
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:56,569
like I'm in the cyber world right now

182
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:59,689
so here's Machiavelli he was very

183
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:03,498
devious looking not to be confused with

184
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:04,579
the other Machiavelli two-putt changed

185
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:06,949
his name towards the end to mark

186
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:12,229
availing read the book in prison and

187
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:13,758
actually the album cover is a parody of

188
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,019
each other but we're not we're not

189
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,689
talking about Tupac

190
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:21,759
they talk about niccolò machiavelli so

191
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:24,139
he wrote a book in 1513 and it was a

192
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:29,509
little bit controversial to say the very

193
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:32,269
least there's a rule goes if the

194
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:34,129
Catholics don't like your book so much

195
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,620
so that they make an entire list that

196
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:39,259
says these books are not allowed to be

197
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,120
read and the person that started that

198
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,920
list is Machiavelli I probably want to

199
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,350
read Machiavelli right at that point

200
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,649
so he's super controversial but really

201
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,149
the book is about an amoral guide to

202
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,660
power and governance

203
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,769
Ray has had a bad press over the years

204
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,449
some of it because a lot of assholes

205
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,540
have read it to to beefer but you know

206
00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:04,878
moving on did I mention it was

207
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:08,259
controversial Kim Davis recently Rosa

208
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:12,230
Parks I don't fucking think so

209
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:13,490
but the prince so back to the book super

210
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:18,050
controversial put your hands up if

211
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:21,679
you've read it long time ago everybody

212
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,569
says that right so yes I said it isn't

213
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,939
rule about governance it's a rule it's a

214
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:28,309
book about how to manage or obtain power

215
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:30,459
and how to keep it that's why people

216
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:34,550
like Nixon had it by their bedside

217
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:39,498
however as we know this is not now

218
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:42,790
there are rules but the prince is where

219
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:45,950
we get the term Machiavellian from

220
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,319
obligatory Wikipedia quote blah blah

221
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,589
blah blah blah but anyway he was a

222
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:56,240
diplomat in the Florentine Republic

223
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:57,769
Italy Renaissance Italy he used to live

224
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,600
in a state that was governed by the

225
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,750
Medici dynasty and the Medici dynasty

226
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,260
was quite the thing at the time right

227
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:09,279
and eventually the Medicis would click

228
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,439
the floor kicked out florentine and

229
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,390
Machiavelli became kind of like an

230
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,829
ambassador then became a chance so he

231
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,230
basically became prime minister in the

232
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:22,189
end but started off as an ambassador and

233
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,810
in that time 14 year period he was

234
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,360
involved with some of the most

235
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,479
influential players in Renaissance

236
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:34,040
Europe that you can think of right he

237
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,829
was in charge of a town Florence right

238
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,390
here in the middle of Renaissance Italy

239
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:45,859
and this is basically Game of Thrones

240
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:48,920
real life right period you're talking

241
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,510
about a period in time where your allies

242
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,219
are your enemies your enemies are your

243
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:56,779
allies and we still haven't done lunch

244
00:11:52,220 --> 00:12:01,100
yet and this changes constantly so he

245
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:04,779
was involved in issues with well all

246
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,670
over and very very diplomatic problems

247
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:10,430
eventually the Medicis come back into

248
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,430
Florence and niccolo machiavelli is

249
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:16,790
arrested for treason and tortured for

250
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:19,550
about three or four days held on to not

251
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,370
confessing to being a part of the

252
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,959
conspiracy against the Medici dynasty

253
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,570
you know they put him on the rack I

254
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:29,000
think that he's quoted as saying that he

255
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,899
went on the rack like nine times bla bla

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,269
bla bla bla and eventually a interesting

257
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:39,260
Pope came along Leo the tenth and Leo

258
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:41,420
the tenth is quite an interesting

259
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,170
character so what he does is he does a

260
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,750
general amnesty and Machiavelli is

261
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,640
pardoned and is allowed to live in exile

262
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,570
away from Florence but in his townhouse

263
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,600
about ten kilometres away also

264
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,300
interestingly enough do you know that

265
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,920
this is the Pope that gate you know that

266
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,979
every British monarch since Henry the

267
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,370
eighth who's used the term defender of

268
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,889
the faith right and most people think

269
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,079
that that title comes from him starting

270
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,959
up the Church of England it actually

271
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,138
isn't the term defender of the faith is

272
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,399
what this guy gave to Leo the tenth gave

273
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,290
to Henry the eighth's

274
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:25,040
after writing a rebuttal to Martin

275
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:27,949
Luther the other famous Protestant which

276
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,149
is quite strange but anyway Leo the

277
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:34,519
tenth pardons Machiavelli unfortunately

278
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:36,230
he's never in high esteem again he split

279
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,769
off to his vineyards he has to work

280
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:43,610
there and he has this idea that he's

281
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:45,350
gonna reach out to the Medici those in

282
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,050
charge of the farnsworth the Florentine

283
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,759
dynasty right now Leo the Magnificent

284
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,910
and he's gonna write a job application

285
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,089
right he's gonna write a book

286
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:58,880
specifically to lira magnificent that

287
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:01,100
says you know hey this serves my

288
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,589
thoughts so it's basically a job advert

289
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,139
it wasn't meant for to be published and

290
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:09,949
read five hundred years later four stars

291
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:14,480
so his opening gambit just to give you a

292
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:17,000
rough idea it's quite cool basically

293
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,949
what he says is is hey look people will

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,019
try and give you gifts to show you that

295
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:23,569
they love you right you're magnificent

296
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,610
and it whatever those people value will

297
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:27,709
be the gift that they give you so if

298
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,500
they value horses you'll get horses if

299
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,420
they value gold you'll get gold me I

300
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,850
don't have much to give but the thing

301
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,979
that I value very very much is the

302
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:41,209
things that I learned dealing with

303
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:45,740
powerful people who so with a little bit

304
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:47,540
of artistic license and for fun let's

305
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,930
see how security could do through

306
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:54,500
Machiavelli's eyes right so the thing is

307
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,599
over the years I've been root on lots of

308
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,470
things lots of things that inner that

309
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:04,639
wants rooted solar panels ray I know

310
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,340
it's a bit weird there's a whole host of

311
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,850
really random shit that I got shallow

312
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,710
over the years and mostly because it was

313
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,730
harder to fail than it was to succeed

314
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:21,320
you know in a lot of cases I owned it by

315
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:23,930
doing admin admin you know who while I

316
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,160
would like to believe I'll take the win

317
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,290
no problems

318
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,480
I've got no shame there but in a lot of

319
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,360
cases as I say it's harder to fail them

320
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,640
is to succeed and a lot of cases why

321
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,840
does this happen well there's a few

322
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,130
different reasons where it happens but

323
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,100
one I'd like to pick on particularly

324
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:42,680
today would be the fortress mentality

325
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:46,280
we've all seen it before we've all heard

326
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,439
that story of ah but it's an internal

327
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,949
system we don't have to worry it's

328
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,760
inside the network like y'all do you

329
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:58,340
know what the internet means that means

330
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,980
interconnected networks so it being

331
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:04,000
internal everything's external if you

332
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,280
try hard enough but they don't get that

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,220
also we've all heard this before right

334
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,360
yeah the firewall handles that this

335
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,380
happens constantly

336
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,300
recently I was told that the firewall

337
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,980
scans malware and the kool shit I don't

338
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,810
like them firewall doing firewall things

339
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,150
never mind malware things now but okay

340
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,189
cool but this is what we see in

341
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,579
corporate states all the time and the

342
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:31,700
reality is in a lot of ways your

343
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,440
fortresses suck they've decrepid the

344
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,490
falling you haven't invested in them

345
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,530
they don't do the job and when you pull

346
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,480
a comp when you point a company's

347
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,970
developers it's sort of putting me off

348
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,390
because my slides are slightly over if

349
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:51,670
any of you have got OCD here shits are

350
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:55,790
in pond companies developers or

351
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:59,469
compromised the IT department it looks

352
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,469
like a career in IT right there right

353
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,950
I'm gonna digress for a second it's an

354
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:09,109
absolutely awesome story I'm really

355
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:11,209
sorry but so my daughter called me up

356
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:13,520
one day and she said to me I mean what

357
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:17,090
you did well that what you doing on the

358
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,119
11th of February 2019 this this this was

359
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:23,720
in April last year I'm like

360
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,428
I'm not sure but I guess like it's a

361
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,309
very specific question for ten-year-old

362
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,270
why ah

363
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,549
Maskull was wondering if you could come

364
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,580
and talk I'm like aha

365
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:36,950
why well they'd liked that they'd like

366
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,668
to speak to Jaco like well why does your

367
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,200
school nor dama Hakka but I told them

368
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:44,750
okay what did they say to you what he

369
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,440
didn't believe me and my uh huh why did

370
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:51,110
he believe you now

371
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,919
well we watched on YouTube okay seems

372
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:57,830
legitimate right so anyway eventually I

373
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,890
end up in a school in Scotland speaking

374
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:03,230
to a bunch of ten year olds which attend

375
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,669
yells and seven years at two classes and

376
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,919
it's very cool because the ten year olds

377
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,929
they were all trying to play cool right

378
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,049
so when I come and I'm super interested

379
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:14,510
but they're very much worried about what

380
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,460
the person next to them like oh no and

381
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,520
my daughter's got this big smile on her

382
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,320
face I'm super nervous I've done lots of

383
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,658
public speaking but the minute they said

384
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,250
can you speak to your children your your

385
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:27,740
child and her school friends

386
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,419
and like no don't maybe do it please

387
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,460
don't make me that I'm scared no no

388
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:33,230
please let me go and speak to the

389
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,929
InfoSec crowd please don't make me do it

390
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,929
but of course consignors my daughter so

391
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,549
anyway I do this talk to a bunch of

392
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,309
seven year olds and they are very

393
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:44,929
different from the ten year olds so

394
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,789
firstly the ten year olds are all set

395
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:49,279
and cool at the table and like yeah I've

396
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:50,750
got snapchat blah blah blah blah and all

397
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,850
being a kind of nonchalant about

398
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,789
everything trying to play it cool and

399
00:18:52,850 --> 00:19:01,459
the seven year olds they came into the

400
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:02,390
room running and it was just chaos and I

401
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,690
thought these are my people

402
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:09,890
awesome I love them carry on Johnson

403
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:12,200
here's some red Bull go on and

404
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,210
eventually they all got their cushions

405
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,620
and sat on the floor so I got my

406
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,880
question Santana Florida teacher made me

407
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,870

408
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,000

413
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,220
mortified when I asked my daughter's

and the kid kids had great answers but

447
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,320
there was a little boy and I'm not gonna

448
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:55,860
lie he looked like he had a career in IT

449
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:57,450
at seven I mean I had warm spot too and

450
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,979
when I said to the whole class like okay

451
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,690

452

453
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,269

with computers I have fucking love you

455
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:10,350
and later on he puts his hand up and I

456
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:10,679
say to him how do you verify who they

457
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,949
are

458
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,330
yes as well the first thing I do is I

459
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,580
tell them to take a photograph

460
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,439

468
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:36,750

I do is I upload the avatar picture to

471
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,309
Google and I see where else it's gone

472
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,850

475
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,899
the image is genuine or not and like who

share the young gentleman's name but

482
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,980
we'll call him the seven-year-old hacker

483
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:17,260
I hope that they they find some use for

484

485

490
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,669
with them this kid

491
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,200
boom anyway I digress and the only

492
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:36,370
reason I digress is it's just two people

493
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,470
that little either should be working in

494
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,678
IT sorry so anyway compromise an IT

495
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,289
department or lull porn or Wi-Fi because

496
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,539
that's not hard to write or own a bunch

497
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,830
of these printers or any other print

498
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:49,780
earns because hey you're hacking

499
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,158
printers we've been doing that for years

500
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,260
let's do it some more there's a whole

501
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:57,510
bunch of new hacks in there it's fucking

502
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:00,820
awesome lawl wreck some VoIP phones and

503
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:04,840
then all of a sudden your big security

504
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:09,610
fortress is a bunch of rocks awesome

505
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,559
well done so fortress mentality has some

506
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,250
flaws but what would Machiavelli have

507
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,950
said about using the fortress mentality

508
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:20,799
and if we look to chapter 20 of the book

509
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:24,789
he actually has a specific speak about

510
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:30,070
fortresses and he goes a long way to say

511
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:32,890
you know if a prince is scared of

512
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,559
foreign invaders he should not be

513
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:39,400
building fortresses if he's scared of

514
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:42,039
his people totally build fortresses so

515
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,500
that's kind of really easy to steal that

516
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:47,320
insecurity right that a security team

517
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,900
who is more afraid of their users should

518
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,110
be using fortresses but the security

519
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,549
team there's more afraid of strangers

520
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:58,209
should maybe focus their security

521
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,930
efforts a little bit more robustly than

522
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:06,510
building high

523
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:09,330
walls obligatory Lebowski picture woohoo

524
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:12,220
the thing is is historically speaking

525
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:14,649
the fortress the issues with fortresses

526
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,890
have slightly been well-documented I'm

527
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:20,800
not sure if you know but people who hide

528
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,350
in fortresses we know where you are it's

529
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,680
the big building with a high wall you're

530
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:29,740
in it so for starters your enemies know

531
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:32,230
where you are before you even start and

532
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,960
secondly you don't actually have to be

533
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,060
effective in a siege to cripple a

534
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,040
fortress just like you don't have to

535
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,370
actually be that effective in a DDoS to

536
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,139
cause problems to a company and if

537
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,169
you're wondering this picture is this is

538
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:50,110
the famous Athens vs. Sparta does

539
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:52,660
anybody know the story about this so

540
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:58,110
this is a great story about should have

541
00:24:52,660 --> 00:25:01,510
updated their antivirus basically so

542
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:03,280
Athens and their big fortress decided

543
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,800
that they were gonna eventually destroy

544
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:10,629
their foe the Spartans and the Spartans

545
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:12,669
went low we we our warrior people into

546
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,140
your philosophers yeah but we've got a

547
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,570
navy like bring it

548
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,010
so the Athens did and they started a war

549
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,710
with the Spartans they've done it a few

550
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,450
times to beefer so the subtle wall of

551
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,580
the Spartans and they're going hide in

552
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,380
their big fortress and they shot all the

553
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,379
doors you see don't worry we're gonna be

554
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,360
supplied from our naval feet we will

555
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,070
stay in the fortress and Spartans will

556
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,469
stay outside and I'll eventually either

557
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,659
have to go or they'll start attacking us

558
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,450
because they're frustrated but either

559
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:45,490
way we'll get them because we've got a

560
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:48,820
plan right awesome unfortunately they

561
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,650
also got the bubonic plague and that

562
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,929
will really screw up your attempts to

563
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:56,020
piss off your neighbor apparently so

564
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:58,240
eventually in the fortress the Spartans

565
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,580
didn't even do it they just waited they

566
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,340
just sat there and waited and eventually

567
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,090
the Athenians brought in the bubonic

568
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,879
plague

569
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,669
everybody got ill the military leader

570
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,740
involved in this died so the plan went

571
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,690
to hell in a handbasket

572
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,120
and then eventually they were completely

573
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,770
and utterly utterly annihilated by the

574
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,800
Spartans that had to do an unconditional

575
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,210
surrender in the end right

576
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,919
but of course they had the security

577
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,420
infrastructure and the advancement of

578
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,380
the military infrastructure that would

579
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,770
be the Navy there were far more

580
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,440
superiors and Navy so this is the

581
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,030
problem with fortresses that they're

582
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,220
very good at keeping your people in

583
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,530
check but they're not very good at

584
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,420
dealing with problems like the like

585
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,800
we've got the bubonic plague or that's

586
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,670
cool we're stuck in these four walls and

587
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,830
we're all gonna die

588
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:48,610
that's not a good position to put

589
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:51,460
yourself in right but fortresses is not

590
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:55,120
the only thing the book talks about we

591
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,490
can actually apply some of this to red

592
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,500
teaming or threat hunting or proactive

593
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:03,670
security or whatever the new term is

594
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,720
probably be purple team soon or

595
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,990
something I know all right

596
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,150
is there a purple team er in the house

597
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:14,620
right okay you know you guys were a

598
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:19,000
parody ten years ago right I'm sorry I'm

599
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:22,709
not trolling you really so red teaming

600
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,809
and we go back to chapter 20 again right

601
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,280
and basically what Machiavelli is

602
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:29,980
talking about here I'm not gonna read

603
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,649
things out you you're all adults but

604
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:36,390
you're all adults in age probably not in

605
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:39,790
spirit later on tonight though but um

606
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:42,700
but basically way says is is that for a

607
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:46,090
prince to be successful he really needs

608
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:48,550
an enemy right fortune if fortune loves

609
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:51,580
the prince they will give them an enemy

610
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:53,559
because it's only in the struggle it's

611
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:58,659
only in the struggle that you can be

612
00:27:53,559 --> 00:28:00,399
victorious and loved red cool so we can

613
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,890
sort of reapply that again right so

614
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,179
instead of you know the prince what we

615
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,790
can say is it'd be good for the blue

616
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:09,100
team to organize some shit with a red

617
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:12,639
team and actually win but by the way

618
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:17,139
just out of interest should the blue

619
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,390
team at least win sometimes no right

620
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:23,110
okay hands up if you think the blue team

621
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,400
should win sometimes okay and the rest

622
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,020
of you I don't care where you believe

623
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,010
you

624
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:31,830
good people right the the red team has

625
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:34,080
to lose sometimes right has to because

626
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,110
otherwise why you keep on testing them

627
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,820
they suck you've proved it now help them

628
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:44,850
grow but anyway as we say Machiavelli

629
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,760
sees the importance of causing chaos of

630
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:50,270
being attacked of defending that and as

631
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,070
all of you know that we learn the most

632
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,770
insecurity once we've been hacked

633
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:57,750
once we've been attacked because all of

634
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,120
those plans all those ideas all of those

635
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,640
things it was there what's the famous

636
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,479
Mike Tyson quote you all have a plan

637
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,060
until you're punched in the face and

638
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,050
security is very much the same thing

639
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,090
paraphrase it but it's um everybody's

640
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,530
got a plan until you I hit you in the

641
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:19,260
nose or something like that but anyway

642
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:21,360
as a ret as a as a as a blue team you

643
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,640
should get your ass kicked every now and

644
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,139
again because that victory will give you

645
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,260
confidence it'll make your people good

646
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:30,950
it will make you stronger right I know

647
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:35,700
I'm a bit like this at this moment right

648
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:38,070
but what would Machiavelli say about

649
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,600
building a security team well

650
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,889
Machiavelli was quite a complex

651
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,139
character and you've probably been

652
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,480
interested in and if you inherited

653
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:49,020
security team or build a security team

654
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:52,050
and I've been involved in both both

655
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,580
processors and what I can tell you is

656
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,620
the kind of person I am

657
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,179
I much prefer to build a security team

658
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,889
because you get to see the people you

659
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,440
get to know the people you get to work

660
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,900
with them when you inherit a security

661
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,450
team what you have is a lot of

662
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,820
complexity that you're only going to be

663
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,420
able to find out on the ground right

664
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,939
you're not gonna find out that you're

665
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,680
your senior pentester actually secretly

666
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,120
has been searching for new jobs the past

667
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,010
three months bla bla bla bla bla you'll

668
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,439
only find these things out on the ground

669
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:24,330
when you see it and I'm not gonna read

670
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,380
the wall of text again but basically

671
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:30,510
what Machiavelli says here is yo if you

672
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,810
take a new place over that's different

673
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,970
in customs in all of the sort of stuff

674
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,409
if it's different different and you're

675
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,150
going to change it

676
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,550
you need to go and live there and he

677
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:44,880
talks about Alexander the Great here

678
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:47,010
when Alexander the Great was great at

679
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,510
stealing other people's land apparently

680
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,280
but at the end the date he was very good

681
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,710
at holding on to it too and this is

682
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,690
because in a lot of cases he would go

683
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,640
and live amongst people and enables you

684
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,080
to fix problems earlier on this is

685
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,650
another one that's super simple to adapt

686
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,780
we can just say yo look if you take over

687
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,970
a new area and you are the security

688
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,760
officer that's responsible for it please

689
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,680
don't do this job remotely you can't be

690
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,930
effective yeah I have to be on the

691
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,490
ground with the troops because it

692
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:18,030
enables you to see problems straight

693
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,980
away how many of you have had senior

694
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,680
security people making decisions about

695
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,740
your security on the ground they have

696
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,650
never even been to your office right I

697
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,870
mean seriously

698
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:35,460
of course there will be problems for

699
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:36,840
this of course they are what happens

700
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,420
with that famous firewall when it

701
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,159
detects ransomware oh my god please stop

702
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,100
clicking on the fucking things that say

703
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,740
Dexy I tell you a small story

704
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,040
I got a panicked phone call from an HR

705
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,690
department awhile ago they're like ah

706
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,930
we've clicked on ransomware what should

707
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:57,180
we do ok don't click on it I'm like no

708
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,590
no no like what should we do like unplug

709
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,230
the system we've done that already

710
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,449
ok then cool just tell Heidi to roll it

711
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,610
back no problems but can you send me the

712
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,280
files just so that we can have a look

713
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:10,139
yeah no problems we can't send them out

714
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,270
the firewalls blocked oh hang on a

715
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,360
second how did it get in if you're gonna

716
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:17,190
block them on the way out it turns out

717
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,550
they were reading the inside of zips

718
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:27,180
very properly and it received a zip with

719
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:30,060
resume exe and resume PDF XE and a

720
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,130
profile picture and I'm like nobody

721
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,950
nobody nobody at any point went that's a

722
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,240
bit odd they just unzipped it and double

723
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,720
clicked on it and I went oh shit

724
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,090
ransomware

725
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,660
unplugged it the first question that you

726
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:45,480
have to ask yourself is why did it evade

727
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,040
so force right I mean that that's the

728
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,200
first thing that we should say here

729
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,190
because clamavi picked this thing up

730
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,230
instead

731
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,049
Dainius Lee and I'm gonna say the

732
00:32:52,230 --> 00:33:00,179
clamoring ears that should be your bare

733
00:32:55,049 --> 00:33:03,418
minimum I believe but anyway whoo

734
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:09,840
it's really like this you know when you

735
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:13,110
look at it right it's super super and

736
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,980
really the problem is you know the

737
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:19,379
obligatory Lebowski picture again but we

738
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,539
didn't really train anybody properly

739
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:23,580
here we can blame the tools right say

740
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:26,460
well the a/v didn't pick it up and you

741
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,870
know what the the anti-malware device

742
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,330
didn't pick you up and blah blah blah

743
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,879
blah blah does security UTM blah blah

744
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:35,879
blah blah blah didn't pick it up maybe

745
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:38,789
fucking look dodgy and what we hadn't

746
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:41,149
done is taught the staff the importance

747
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:44,870
of you see if that looks a bit weird

748
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:47,370
probably not to do it right but actually

749
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:50,879
Machiavelli it's almost like giving

750
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,979
staff tools arms to be able to defend

751
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:55,408
themselves against strangers trying to

752
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,059
steal things from Machiavelli has this

753
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:00,200
great point and basically what it says

754
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:02,908
is when it goes into a principality the

755
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,220
where the citizens have been unarmed

756
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:08,010
it's super wise to arm the citizens

757
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,770
because they will be forever in your

758
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,290
grave forever in your gratitude for

759
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:15,480
releasing them but more importantly

760
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:20,129
they'll be really good defending you as

761
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,480
partisans so arm them so hey we can do

762
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:24,480
the whole user awareness training under

763
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,750
this - that it doesn't make sense for a

764
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,960
security officer to go into a new place

765
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,060
and be very restrictive it makes sense

766
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,970
to start educating as soon as soon as

767
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,969
possible to arm people up because the

768
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:41,239
only effective firewall that you're ever

769
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:43,348
going to have is your users

770
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,750
unfortunately in brain and we need to

771
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:48,450
wake up to that because there isn't

772
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,190
going to be a next gen 2.0 blockchain

773
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:52,500
assisted bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

774
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:56,670
bla bla other thing right it's just

775
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,840
going to be pitch as it always has right

776
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:02,760
you're only effective firewall is people

777
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,470
educate them and you know what maybe

778
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,460
they'll fuck up every now and again but

779
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,870
so do you guys so it's all fair now I

780
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,550
know I'm supposed to be half an hour I

781
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:15,750
know I'm slightly over so I'm gonna wrap

782
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:16,890
up a little bit right so the talk was

783
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,480
supposed to be about a little bit about

784
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,759
fun but it's really about good

785
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,270
governance our embassy is about good

786
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,420
governance

787
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:27,390
I knew the things are really crazy when

788
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,850
the long haired hacker in the business

789
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,069
meeting was saying you know we really

790
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:34,290
need some good policy here that's when

791
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,780
I'm like oh shit the world is inversed

792
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:38,880
it's upside down maybe when they were

793
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,150
making black holes in Swiss mountains

794
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,700
the parallel universe happened but when

795
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,620
you have hackers start talking about

796
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:50,310
policy and governance as something very

797
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:52,279
able to help users survive your security

798
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:58,020
is pretty fucked at that point Graham

799
00:35:52,280 --> 00:36:00,720
but we as an industry tend to love geeky

800
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,720
things but we don't tend to look further

801
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,140
back for other solutions we find that in

802
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,379
tech industries every innovation is a

803
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,029
new revolution right but a lot of

804
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,640
lessons can be learned in history about

805
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,040
good governance helping users to be safe

806
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,009
is a governance job right that that's

807
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,920
what we're there to do also superhot

808
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:25,170
take but Machiavelli wasn't very

809
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,510
Machiavellian I can give you probably

810
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:31,470
two big reasons firstly he was a bit of

811
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:35,130
a loser so he never got employed again

812
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:37,049
he basically wrote a few books but after

813
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,600
he wrote that job application it was

814
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,520
thrown in a drawer and forgotten about

815
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,500
and published five years after his death

816
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,230
do you know the prince was never called

817
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,910
the prince in Machiavelli's lifetime it

818
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:50,790
was called that after his death when it

819
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,680
was published by the publishing house so

820
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:55,590
it was never supposed to be that also

821
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,259
not super Machiavellian to actually

822
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:00,510
write the rules down and then give it to

823
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,940
people he seems to mean the more

824
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,130
Machiavellian would have been I'll shut

825
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,640
the fuck up and benefit from it and I'll

826
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,530
win that way so yeah here the three hot

827
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,020
takes that want his takeaway today

828
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:15,060
remember fortresses defend you from your

829
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,759
own people right that's what the Dare

830
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,080
for and of course we do have to defend

831
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,120
ourselves against our own people from

832
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:26,910
time to time they do do some dumb stuff

833
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:31,680
right they're human but we have to be

834
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:33,799
vigilant when we say our security is the

835
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,049
security that starts out of the firewall

836
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:40,700
because otherwise you're just the

837
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,700
Athenians waiting for the bubonic plague

838
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:48,750
if you get hacked it's a great

839
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,850
opportunity don't forget that like if

840
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,370
you are doing good work people will

841
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:55,500
target you and learning how to define

842
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:59,520
that will will make you better don't

843
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:05,220
panic and remember failure is a natural

844
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,980
side-effect of trying or trying is the

845
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,379
first step towards failure one of the

846
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,550
two right I can't believe that you

847
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:17,610
