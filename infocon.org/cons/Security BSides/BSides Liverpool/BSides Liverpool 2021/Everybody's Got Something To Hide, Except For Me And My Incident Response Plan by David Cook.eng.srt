1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,960
i'm david cook i'm from a law firm

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,799
called dla piper

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,120
i've got a job title legal direct all

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,719
this sort of stuff that doesn't matter

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,799
what what i do day to day though is deal

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,880
with incident response

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,320
and we act on behalf of the information

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,760
commissioner's office and against the

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,439
information commission's office with

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,439
cyber security data breaches

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,320
um most of the matters we deal with i i

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
can't discuss publicly obviously but

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,760
it's public knowledge that we act on

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,599
behalf of soloins for the solarwinds

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,600
breach so it's that sort of stuff um

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,960
and so it means that we have lots of

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
contact with organizations that you know

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
the worst day of the cso's life uh cyber

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,280
security incident and the

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
stuff that i tend to advise on comes

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,039
either within the network and

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,200
information systems regulations or the

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,920
gdpr the dreaded gdpr it's not just

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,760
about cookies and marketing it's also

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,160
about other stuff which i which i find

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,360
quite interesting

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,559
so

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
let's go through it um

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,280
what

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
i think is really interesting is it's

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,399
not going to be

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,520
death by

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,799
you know powerpoint and death by

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,960
statistics but just bear with me some

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
interesting ones here so every year uh

36
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
dcms runs a cyber security breaches

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
survey and they ask big organizations

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,920
about what they think about various

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,759
things what their experiences are and

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
every year i look to see what's going on

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,479
and every year these stats surprise me

42
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,680
and so this year's one 40 of businesses

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
reported suffering a cyber security

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,439
breach or a successful attack within the

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,079
last 12 months a quarter suffer them

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,360
once a week

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,759
uh and 77 percent of businesses say that

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,079
cyber security is a high priority so far

49
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,400
so good it's all the sort of stuff we

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
imagine it's the case and we probably

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
see as the case every day

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,119
only 31 of businesses have got an

53
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,720
instant response plan

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,520
so

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,799
there's a disconnect there and it's

56
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,159
something i come in contact with all the

57
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,200
time

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
and you'll see yourselves in in

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,040
organizations if if you work

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,719
in relation to incident response which

61
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,360
is

62
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
there's there's money plowed into

63
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,520
information security security but that

64
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,960
doesn't always translate into where that

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,959
funding needs to go the most and

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,038
incident response plans and

67
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,640
understanding what an organization is

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
going to do in the event

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
is a really obvious thing but

70
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,400
vast majority of organizations don't

71
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,879
ever actually think about it so

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,560
we'll come to it there's very strict

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
timelines under the gdpr you've got to

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
report a breach within a very set period

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,440
of time otherwise you have to explain

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
why you're out of time

77
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,680
now the worst possible time to work out

78
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
how you're going to deal with a breach

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
who's going to sign off on telling the

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
information commissioner if it's over

81
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,599
weekend who's going to speak to the

82
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,160
lawyers or the external forensic i.t

83
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
provider who's going to speak to the

84
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
board are the board going to get

85
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
together over zoom or how they're going

86
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
to come into the office and if it's over

87
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
zoom how does that work if the network

88
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,400
goes down all those sort of questions

89
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
nobody thinks about upfront they think

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
about that in the event of a breach in

91
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,560
the middle of this you know the the

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
blazing and white heat of into the

93
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
response

94
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,720
you know

95
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
that sounds over the top but actually

96
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,080
there are times when caesars are crying

97
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,720
during this it has bad bad times

98
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,599
so do all that work up front that's easy

99
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,920
to say isn't it the reality is vast

100
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
majority of organizations don't and and

101
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,120
that's that's what i want to tell people

102
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120
to do i've told people to do it for five

103
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
years and the stats are not changing so

104
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
i'm not affecting the results of these

105
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,720
surveys but i think this this is an

106
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,799
interesting topic so

107
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,720
what do we see in reality and you know

108
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
you guys can be familiar with this stuff

109
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,239
but on the left there we've got the

110
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,040
events so the threat actor establishes

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,120
access to a network we've then got the

112
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,080
detection point so it's recognized and

113
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,760
it's known as an issue and as that's

114
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,200
then triage

115
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,760
we've got reporting for the regulator or

116
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,239
data subjects data subjects is a gdpr

117
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,680
term that means the individual is

118
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,959
involved

119
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,120
we've got containment so vulnerability

120
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,879
and threats removed and on the right

121
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,840
remediation

122
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,239
now in reality this this phase this

123
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
latter half that's all within the same

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
thing you know once you report the

125
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
regulator they then want to know about

126
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
all this other stuff when i say

127
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
regulator i mean the information

128
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
commission's office but that could also

129
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,439
be the case for the fca if it's a fca

130
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,639
regulated firm and that could also be

131
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,960
some of the utility sector regulators so

132
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
regulators are on top of this straight

133
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
away because they see there's an issue

134
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
people are at risk

135
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,759
but what does the gdpr say about this

136
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,639
now look

137
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,479
it's not going to be legal lecture but

138
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,160
the difference between event and

139
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
detection so when uh when the threat

140
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
factor structures access to the network

141
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,720
when it's spotted that averages out

142
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,080
around three months now the gdpr doesn't

143
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,479
explicitly talk about what that stage

144
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,160
should be but it does say that

145
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
organizations should know what's going

146
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,960
on

147
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,280
the information is

148
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,160
public

149
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,120
lectures

150
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,299
[Music]

151
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,940
[Applause]

152
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,129
[Music]

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
it takes three months for an

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
organization

155
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,030
um

156
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:45,929
[Music]

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,960
telling the

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
you know

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
hours

160
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
so again once an organization works out

161
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,000
it's happened

162
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,990
[Music]

163
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,280
says

164
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,750
two percent likewise

165
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,720
[Music]

166
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,919
wrongly that these regulations

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,039
the gps says

168
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,339
[Music]

169
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,659
[Music]

170
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,720
in your mind collaboration so if you're

171
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
on the practice

172
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,599
and then they ask before you introduce

173
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,599
foreign

174
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,680
[Music]

175
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
and in order to demonstrate that we have

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,720
appropriate security in place we've got

177
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
these plans to contain and remediate the

178
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,759
issue and that demonstrates your uh

179
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
position around cyber security and your

180
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,240
your posture if you come at the

181
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,680
information commissioner and say this

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,039
issues happened it was a criminal it's

183
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,400
not our fault we're not going to do

184
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
anything else because what more could we

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,199
have done the information commissioner

186
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,800
will go mad and you will get an audit

187
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
and you will get technical teams asking

188
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,639
you lots of difficult questions if you

189
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,800
go and say we know what the issue was

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,639
multi-factor authentication was set but

191
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,800
we could have had uh localized access

192
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,160
control

193
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,479
a more sophisticated picture very

194
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,639
sophisticated even more sophisticated

195
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
picture that then you can see how the

196
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,319
information commissioner or whatever

197
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,680
regulator

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
could be more relaxed about that but but

199
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,879
the point is that the real issue is the

200
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,440
event to detection that's too long three

201
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,720
months is too long but we're not going

202
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
to change that very quickly that's a

203
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
cultural thing cyber security culture is

204
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,760
a very critical task but detections are

205
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,320
reporting you see that around two weeks

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,839
after insulin detected it's been

207
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,240
reported and organizations are routinely

208
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
out of time and we have to find

209
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
a justification or a way that we can say

210
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,279
the point of awareness was perhaps at a

211
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,600
different time that reflects better on

212
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
the organization but the reason that

213
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
protection to reporting time is so long

214
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
is because organizations don't know what

215
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
to do what information do we need who's

216
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,800
going to give it to us and who's going

217
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,560
to put their neck on the line and sign

218
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
off on this

219
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
that is what takes the time and it's

220
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,360
those questions that can be done up

221
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,160
front and in other more mature just um

222
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
jurisdictions around cyber security so

223
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
particularly in the us so california had

224
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
the first mandatory breach notification

225
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
law in 2001 so americans are good at

226
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,320
this stuff and what they have there is

227
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,959
routinely have instant response plans in

228
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
place and all this sort of exotic

229
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
language like wargaming and playbooks

230
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,519
and things that make sense on paper

231
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,519
people really doing practice but in the

232
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,880
us they do

233
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,519
here they don't and i think that this is

234
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,360
an area that if it's tightened up will

235
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,160
will

236
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,000
move organizations from a position where

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
they are rushing to get the information

238
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
on the door and making mistakes and

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
inviting regulatory scrutiny and data

240
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
protection compensation claims and all

241
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
the bad stuff you see in the newspapers

242
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,760
you know

243
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,959
i despite my accent work in manchester

244
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,440
and we had a large retailer a

245
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
supermarket had a breach within 24 hours

246
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,440
there was a full-page advert in the

247
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
manchester evening news saying have you

248
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
been affected by this data breach you

249
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,519
can claim 5000 pound compensation it was

250
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,920
a a figure out of thinner but a

251
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,240
compensation class action

252
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
and again look to the us for what

253
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,839
compensation class action looks like

254
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,040
we're going to see the same sort of

255
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
thing developing here and we are

256
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,200
some of this stuff you know

257
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
the the law

258
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
in in the black letter law and paper and

259
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,079
what we see in practice could be

260
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,399
different and regulatory fines will come

261
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
on too and four percent of underglow

262
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,839
will turn over we don't see anything

263
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
like that in practice but that

264
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
compensation bit we are seeing that when

265
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,399
we're seeing a growing culture around

266
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,160
compensation following the data breach

267
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
and that is the bit and this links in

268
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,839
with that the last a bit i think is

269
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
scary

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,720
so

271
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
gdpr

272
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
we got all that rubbish through our

273
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
emails a few years back will you consent

274
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,440
to allow marxism to continue and all

275
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
this sort of stuff the gdpr's about much

276
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,360
more than that but and it's this bit in

277
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,519
the middle here so gdpr talks about

278
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,519
accountability being able to prove

279
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
compliance from a cyber security

280
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,760
perspective it's being able to show how

281
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
your security was

282
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,519
appropriate and how you can justify it

283
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,760
so it's stuff like have you had audits

284
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,839
have you had pen tests have you

285
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,800
had a

286
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
program of continuous improvements have

287
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,120
you evolved this over time can you

288
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
demonstrate that you have appropriate

289
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,279
security what's in the market

290
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,079
is that a sign to end

291
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,360
[Music]

292
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,399
i mean this session's on fire

293
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,639
all right let's give a recap it looks

294
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,079
like there's more people in before no

295
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,680
that's great so

296
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
what i was saying right was

297
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
that event point so the threat act that

298
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,240
gets on the network to detection takes

299
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
about three months and that's massively

300
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,839
longer than it should be and from

301
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,320
detection to reporting which should be

302
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,279
72 hours because the law says it gdpr

303
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,440
says it that takes about two weeks on

304
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
average and what i'm saying is the

305
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,839
solution is incident response plans

306
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,240
people should plan and understand what

307
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,519
they're going to do who's going to be

308
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,600
the person who calls in the lawyers if

309
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,880
it's going to happen who's going to be

310
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
the person to call in the external

311
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,000
providers if it's going to happen who's

312
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
going to be the person to sign off who's

313
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,959
going to stick your neck out right all

314
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,839
that stuff adds to what is taking two

315
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,360
weeks and should take sense to us and

316
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,000
could do if it's done in a meaningful

317
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,639
way where people have thought before it

318
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
happens how they're going to respond to

319
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
this sort of incident so so that that's

320
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,480
where we were up to and what i was

321
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
saying was all the bad stuff about the

322
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,120
gdpr comes out as a result of it so the

323
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
gdpr talks about accountability you're

324
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,399
going to be able to demonstrate

325
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,880
compliance in document form they'll be

326
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,720
accountable you know they'll show how

327
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
and why you're accountable and then

328
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,120
there's other stuff here which you know

329
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
probably don't need to go into any great

330
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
detail but data protection by design and

331
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
default this is a new system we've got a

332
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,959
big data protection from the start

333
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,320
privacy impact assessment we've got to

334
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,760
consider what the privacy risk is and

335
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,000
try and reduce it transparency data

336
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,680
subject right all this sort of stuff and

337
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
this is what organizations are spending

338
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,519
money on spending money on stuff like

339
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,519
how do we deal with data subject access

340
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,880
requests

341
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,199
transparency how do we tell people what

342
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,360
we're doing privacy impact assessments

343
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
so a document that sits on a computer

344
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,959
somewhere saying that when we've rolled

345
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
out this um exposed everything to the

346
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,240
cloud we've thought about what the

347
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
impact is all this stuff beneath the

348
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
hood and hidden away and then they get

349
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
pierced by those three things on the

350
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,079
left there so

351
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,760
the subject access request goes wrong

352
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
and you get grassed up

353
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,680
at the bottom the regulator's doing an

354
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,519
audit on your sector and the regulator's

355
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,600
doing an audit on ad tech at the moment

356
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,040
so they're asking lots of questions and

357
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
getting into the meat but in the middle

358
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,519
ear personal data breach you have to go

359
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,959
to the regulator you've got to tell them

360
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
we've got some bad stuff going on and

361
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,480
then they ask questions which can

362
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,920
improve all this stuff so all of the the

363
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
money that's gone into gdpr uh

364
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
remediation and preparation is then

365
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,959
potentially undermined by a personal

366
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,600
data breach and i would say if you go to

367
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
the regulation and say we found out

368
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,199
about this two weeks ago

369
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,800
we're only telling you now you're

370
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,160
already in a defensive position and

371
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,360
you're much more likely to ask these

372
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
questions because the consequences are

373
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
there's criminal offences

374
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
computing issues act but it happens more

375
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,279
than you probably realize

376
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,600
uh civil litigation so compensation

377
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
claims and a regulatory enforcement bit

378
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,399
so fines of up to four percent of annual

379
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,880
global turnover for the breach

380
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,519
but then also finds up to two percent of

381
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,199
annual global turnover if you report

382
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,519
late they can be combined you can have

383
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,199
uh six percent for that reason

384
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,639
and we'll come on to that we didn't see

385
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
any of this stuff but it's possible

386
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
and if we look further down the road i

387
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
think that this sort of stuff is coming

388
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,760
up and the reason is is this

389
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,800
some nice little things that are

390
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,079
flashing let's go on so over time we are

391
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,399
seeing more penalties issued under the

392
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,240
gdpr so by the data protection

393
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
supervisory authorities in this country

394
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
the information commissioner's office so

395
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
you can see in the phases so gdpr came

396
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,440
in in may 2018 and so at the beginning

397
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
there are very few penalties and this is

398
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,440
not cumulative this is for each period

399
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,120
alone april 2019 to march 2020 big jump

400
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,199
and then an even bigger jump there i

401
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,000
think so there are more penalties coming

402
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
up within these time periods than ever

403
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,880
before um

404
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
and the value of them sort of i mean

405
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,959
strange that that even though there were

406
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,880
more penalties for those two initial

407
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,399
phases actually the value didn't really

408
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,199
go up but suddenly the april 2012 march

409
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,320
2021 massive massive increase what does

410
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,600
that tell us

411
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,360
because people are constantly critical

412
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
of the information commissioner's office

413
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,720
because they've issued relatively few

414
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
penalties but they're doing a lot of

415
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
stuff there's a lot of investigations

416
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
the ico

417
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
started life and it's in manchester

418
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,480
where i'm in manchester so you know

419
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
these guys they started life almost like

420
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
an ombudsman and nudged they were

421
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,839
nudging you towards compliance and the

422
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,600
gdpr says you have teeth you've got to

423
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,959
bury your teeth you've got a bite on

424
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,279
people they're not really used to that

425
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,480
but they're doing a lot of stuff behind

426
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
the scenes now what you can see here is

427
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,600
across europe

428
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,000
and increasingly in the uk the regulator

429
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
is not only there in a team but also

430
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,360
cruising down with some fairly fairly

431
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
big penalties but what's interesting is

432
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
the information commissioner's office

433
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,000
you know what we've got there is the

434
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,720
fourth highest penalties imposed

435
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
in europe and the uk for gdpr are

436
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,399
uk information commissioner's fines so

437
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,279
so

438
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,600
we're not behind the curve by any event

439
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,120
it's just that they're all clustered in

440
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,119
two or three penalties which is which is

441
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,359
not great uh and the top ten largest

442
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,119
fines imposed

443
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,480
we've got their france number one that's

444
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,880
google 50 million and it goes right down

445
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,720
there but you can see fourth and fifth

446
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,959
we've got uk penalties against british

447
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,039
airways and marriott and both of those

448
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,679
cyber security failings were uh british

449
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,160
airways uh well and married or both

450
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,520
legacy systems that were no longer

451
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,640
looked at

452
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
and obviously believe something can you

453
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,960
neglect it security

454
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,799
is not patches aren't implemented the

455
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,400
security is not updated over time you

456
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,520
can see how things go wrong

457
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,599
[Music]

458
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,960
the issue arising and the

459
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,559
the time between the issue

460
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,919
[Music]

461
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,160
yeah

462
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,640
yeah

463
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
it's not a legacy system you're right in

464
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
in a penalty notice it refers to a

465
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
legacy system so that there may be other

466
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
points there that i'm not aware of i i

467
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
guess the point is that the penalty was

468
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,799
imposed for cyber security failings

469
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,080
whatever they looked like and there's a

470
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
very good point there i think that

471
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,480
forced his fortitude days as you know

472
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
that's justifiable there are other

473
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,679
issues and the penalty notice is a long

474
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,440
notice and there's quite a lot of

475
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
lookout there

476
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
but the point is that the regulator

477
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,160
although people criticize it for

478
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,240
relatively few penalties

479
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,840
what we're seeing in practice is the

480
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,919
penalties is imposing a large and there

481
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,240
are a lot of open investigations we know

482
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
that because we act

483
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,000
in a lot of these sorts of cases and the

484
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
regulator's got a big sector or focus at

485
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,640
the moment looking at bad stuff that's

486
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
going on so after the cambridge

487
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,480
analytica and brexit investigation they

488
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,960
then began to look at data misuse in a

489
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,799
much more holistic way but they've got

490
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,160
all this stuff coming down the track as

491
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
well and we know they've got a lot of

492
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
open investigations for big cyber

493
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
security incidents that you've read

494
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
about in the news but um so going back

495
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,320
to the beginning uh and probably a good

496
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,720
place to stop is we've got here

497
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
that only 30 percent of organizations 31

498
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
organizations have got plans for this i

499
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,400
say by thinking about this organizations

500
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
are not only in a better state to

501
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,240
respond if there's an incident but

502
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,840
probably also see what those failings

503
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
are if the person is going to sign off

504
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,080
on this as a ceo does the ceo need to be

505
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
briefed on cyber security what the

506
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,919
issues might be if you're going to call

507
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,360
lawyers and i talk about lawyers a lot

508
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,480
because i'm a lawyer but if you're going

509
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,679
to talk about

510
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,280
third parties you've been struck third

511
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,720
parties have you thought about who they

512
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,640
are have you thought about if the it

513
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,160
director is going to be on holiday who's

514
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
going to sign off in his absence what

515
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
happens if your network goes down how do

516
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,880
you communicate with each other do you

517
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,440
have a second

518
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,039
communications network through phones or

519
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,120
whatever it might be so

520
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,480
i think that's quite an easy step to

521
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,640
take instant response plan in some form

522
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
or another is probably a good idea

523
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
okay we were cut midway there by the

524
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,520
fire alarm but hopefully that's enough

525
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,159
of a whistle-stop tour that's a

526
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,640
you walk away ready for a beer and happy

527
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,000
thanks very much any questions

528
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,159
thanks i don't mind having questions at

529
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,960
the bar or here

530
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,480
um

531
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,039
uh

532
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,360
yeah so that's a good question so what

533
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,720
what happens is

534
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,159
and this this is a lawyer thing i

535
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,600
suppose you have

536
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,840
open communications which can be

537
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,360
referred to in court or in public and

538
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,280
you have without prejudice discussions

539
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
so they are discussions which are

540
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,120
aimed to negotiate the settlements which

541
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,280
aren't public a lot of the stuff in this

542
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,600
country happens behind the scenes and

543
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,120
that without prejudice which is not made

544
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,960
public however

545
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
there are large monetary penalty notices

546
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,400
which give lots of information to what

547
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
went wrong and they're worth looking at

548
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,840
they don't give granular detail but

549
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,960
certainly something you can wave in

550
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,559
front of the ball but in the other

551
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,559
jurisdictions so

552
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,679
you've

553
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,039
this is a problem but you know the

554
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,200
french finds a lot of information some

555
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
of the jurisdictions don't publicize the

556
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,679
penalties at all so it varies but if you

557
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,360
want to scare your board and if you want

558
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
to release funding and raise awareness

559
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,840
there's genuinely racist british airways

560
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,880
penalty notices and the married

561
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
counselors are worth reading they do

562
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,760
give quite a lot of information

563
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,919
86 pages

564
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,039
100 i've only read half of it okay 86

565
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,400
pages

566
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,840
tough going yes

571
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
the fourth biggest law firm in the world

572
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
and it's easy to be seen to be looking

573
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
down on some of these street firms and i

574
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
wouldn't want to do that but where there

575
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,640
are uh justifications for claiming

576
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,960
compensation from these organizations

577
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,240
there are law firms who are looking for

578
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,559
that business and in the aftermath of a

579
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,720
big incident they frequently have google

580
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
adwords and facebook adverts and take

581
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,039
adverts out in in newspapers so they're

582
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,720
easy to come by i think it's i think

583
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
it's quite scary because there's lots of

584
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
these claims going on they settle for

585
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,840
about two thousand three thousand pound

586
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,240
a pop for each claim so if there's a big

587
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
incident that affects hundreds of

588
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
thousands of people it could wipe the

589
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,039
company out you wouldn't be allowed to

590
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,120
also but you can see that you see the

591
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
there then with the fat but it might be

592
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,280
a good sign of the future maybe in the

593
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
absence of regulatory enforcement that

594
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
is the the mechanism by which cyber

595
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,039
security is enforced in a way maybe

596
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,840
i think it was a question

597
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,360
okay

[Music]

599
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,760
it is whatever it looks like it's what

600
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,039
you do in the event of a breach i would

601
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,400
say a policy is you know an

602
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,840
organization's policies we will be

603
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,080
transparent we will report the regulator

604
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,320
we will cooperate with authorities and a

605
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,679
plan is what you're actually going to do

606
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,360
behind the scenes and a runbook or a

607
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
playbook is

608
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
how would it work in practice but

609
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,919
whatever the distinction is you know

610
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,200
it's planning what you're going to do in

611
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,039
the event no matter what you call it

612
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,520
okay

613
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,600
so the only and it was how do i see

614
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
organizations change their approach to

615
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
cyber security insurance the biggest

616
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
thing is ransomware they are very keen

617
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,279
to pay the ransom if they're insured and

618
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,640
sometimes the insurance wants to pay

619
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,960
their answer but besides that i don't i

620
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
don't really see

621
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,000
that that there's much of a difference

622
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,279
the insurer is breathing down the next

623
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,440
and go be given updates and it slows

624
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
things down but there isn't actually

625
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
much just a ransomware

626
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,829
[Music]

627
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,799
i mean i'd love to give you a legal

628
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,799
lecture a bit late in the day but

629
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,400
but you have to report to the regulator

630
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
once you are aware of a personal data

631
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,480
breach what does a word mean and that

632
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,919
that's the bit that i you know look at

633
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,559
almost every day so it's once you become

634
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,720
once you have positive evidence

635
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
that there is an insulin which affects

636
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,840
personal data

637
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
and i think i think that's the point

638
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,320
with that awareness when is it

639
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
crystallized so

640
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
that's a difficult question

641
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,799
uh

642
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,329
[Music]

643
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
yeah so

644
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,760
so for those who don't know the

645
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,039
information commission is being replaced

646
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,000
with the new commissioner because their

647
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,279
terms come to an end so you're not

648
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,480
nothing suspicious but there's a new

649
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,080
influence commission who comes from new

650
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,640
zealand the old one came from canada um

651
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,159
is it gonna be a difference i mean it's

652
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,000
not just the person at the top who

653
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,159
defines the tone but department for

654
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,240
culture media supporters not intervened

655
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
but exerted pressure on the ico and and

656
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,679
so i think one we may see more

657
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,799
regulatory action but two dcms seems to

658
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,559
want to be

659
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,520
more supportive of of uk businesses and

660
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,480
this idea of a digital strategy so

661
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,520
it's going to be you know be more

662
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,600
aggressive but against the right sort of

663
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,960
organization so

664
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,320
taking away with one hand given the

665
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,200
others so i don't know the answer uh

666
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,600
yeah so

667
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,520
so i mean we we are in the midst of all

668
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,600
this stuff so you can't comment too much

669
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,039
but but there's supposed to be changes

670
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,799
about how the gdpr is implemented and

671
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,080
what it means in practice and whether

672
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,600
you're gonna do away with some of these

673
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,360
impact assessments ideas and we'll see

674
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,200
how it plays out i think gdpr is pretty

675
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
good

676
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,520
you're all probably sick of it because

677
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,039
of the media

678
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
reporting about marketing emails

679
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,039
when you look at it from

680
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,760
position of protecting data and reducing

681
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,520
risk i think a lot of that makes sense

682
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,200
but it's not fleshed out because not in

683
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
too many cases yet

684
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
i think we've probably got time for

685
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,840
maybe one more question then

686
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,000
what

687
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,159
yeah well not by you but uh yeah okay

688
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,240
uh so what one more question should we

689
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,080
do a lottery for it

690
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,678
okay no more questions then we're done
