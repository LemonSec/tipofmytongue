1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,759
hi welcome to here comes the saw uh

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,600
getting rid of my sort of beatles pun

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
early on in the title there

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
but for anyone reading that title and

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,160
sort of thinking well that's a bit

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,280
ominous

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
don't panic slow's not here to take our

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,880
jobs it's here to help us get rid of

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,960
those menial tasks um

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,560
leaving humans to make decisions and

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
focus on key areas

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,160
so

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
a little bit about me uh currently i'm a

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,279
thor product owner and technical lead

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
for a global mssp i've been doing that

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,480
role for about two years but i've been

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
involved in soar for about the past four

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,680
so

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
a bit about the talk um

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,960
the ubiquitous nature of saw was kind of

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
essentially the origin of talk we're

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
getting more and more customers that are

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,079
interested in saw more vendors that

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,160
claim to sell solar products and jobs

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,199
that are popping up left right and

26
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,879
center it's a product with great

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,960
potential as long as you know

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,640
what you want and why you want it but i

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,920
just want to go over some of the things

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
that we've seen last few years where

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
actually maybe you can sort of benefit

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
from our experience a little bit so

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
hopefully there'll be some useful things

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,040
that you can use to maybe ask those

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
questions of your own sore programs or

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,640
guide your own saw experience if you

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,479
haven't sort of started down that track

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,600
yet um that being said if you are fully

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
embedded with saw in your environment

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
this talk might not be for you it's more

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
sort of like those early hints and tips

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
and things that can hopefully uh guide

43
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,159
you and bit of a disclaimer this is just

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,000
my experience and opinions it's totally

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
cool to disagree with me i think i'm

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
wrong i'm almost certainly not correct

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
on all of this

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,400
not all solar platforms are created

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
equally um be wary of any company that

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
tells you that it has sole capability so

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
is not just about automation stores

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,079
everything all those built-in commands

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,159
many of the platforms that are out there

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,399
at the moment you know in reality maybe

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,040
they're an sa platform or an sr platform

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
they might do some of the automation

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,159
some of the response but they're not

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,799
doing all the four elements or all three

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
of the elements at least

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
if you've not already chosen a solar

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,000
platform make sure you buy something

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
that suits your purpose if you just want

63
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,440
something that's going to enrich your

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
scene data then use a theme that's got

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
submit like smart response or pre-built

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
workflow

67
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
workbooks

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,239
if you need a full sore environment then

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
that's what you should be looking for

70
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
some of the companies that say maybe

71
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
they've got a seamstor solution they

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,599
actually expect you to write a lot of

73
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
your own integrations for the text and

74
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,239
if that's the case really well

75
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,840
you could just hire a developer it's

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,959
gonna be a lot cheaper give them an

77
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,959
online ide you know get them to write a

78
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,360
few sort of api hooks

79
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,640
if you're using the sole platform

80
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,080
outright you should have those

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,840
orchestrations written for you for

82
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
security technologies you know some of

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,040
them out there are offering 600 built-in

84
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,760
out-of-the-box capabilities that you can

85
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
start using you know pretty quickly once

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
you've given it a few credentials so

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,959
on top of that as well sir environment

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
should age with ir as well so it's not

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,760
just that you're running some

90
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,120
orchestrations you're not just looking

91
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
at seamless you're actually potentially

92
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
going to be running full breach

93
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,680
environments of investigations within

94
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
within the soil platform itself so

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
when buying the soil platform i'd say we

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,599
really need to focus on each of the

97
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,200
elements orchestration commands should

98
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,959
be simple and easy to use

99
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,280
automation should be written for us uh

100
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
if not then you're going to inherit a

101
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,080
lot of technical debt

102
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,640
you need to employ devs if the api

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,239
changes then you're gonna have to get

104
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
them to update it depending on how many

105
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,519
technologies you're integrating and how

106
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,440
many commands you're running i can zoom

107
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
rack up if one of those devs leave you

108
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,120
know you're gonna regret it

109
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,239
so

110
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,760
should also be using ir like i've

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,599
mentioned

112
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
the response elements literally in the

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
name right we want to make sure that we

114
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
can record our investigations we want to

115
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,360
be able to build timelines lines show

116
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
the evidence of everything when when we

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
you know you know when we find a

118
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,120
compromise store all in one place and

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,480
have that

120
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,959
make the life of the ir team easier you

121
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
know get away from that traditional

122
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,560
note-taking thing make sure it's all

123
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
collaborative in saw

124
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
a bit of a disclaimer source definitely

125
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
not a silver bullet even though i might

126
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,319
talk about it like it is uh there's

127
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,319
still a lot of hard work involved

128
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,920
uh but it's definitely a first step

129
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,599
towards that sort of single pane of

130
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,199
glass that we sort of want in in

131
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,959
security

132
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
out of the box as well

133
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,320
not always a good thing you shouldn't

134
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,960
necessarily just be looking at some uh

135
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,919
because maybe the number of

136
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,960
out-of-the-box

137
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
integrations uh

138
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
if the integrations are there don't do

139
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,639
anything for you or it's not for

140
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
technologies that you've got you

141
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,320
probably want to maybe reassess if that

142
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
sole platform's right for you

143
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
based on some of the companies that

144
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,880
we've analyzed and sort of looked at

145
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,160
their technologies the security

146
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,759
technologies and then compared that them

147
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,199
to a vendor

148
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,560
uh you can actually end up with a suite

149
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,120
of technologies and only a handful of

150
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,759
them have usable apis and then only one

151
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,280
of those apis is actually in the saw

152
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,479
platform

153
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,840
in the first place so you've really got

154
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,199
to make sure that

155
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
you assess your own need against the

156
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
platform and don't just pick it based on

157
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
on like a number

158
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,039
same thing goes for playbooks it's all

159
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,800
well and good having a thousand out

160
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,360
out-of-the-box playbooks and uh you know

161
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
capabilities there or workbooks whatever

162
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
you want to call them

163
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,440
but if none of those playbooks solve a

164
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
problem that your company has then

165
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
you've just got a load of space getting

166
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
taken up on the box and it's you know

167
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,039
it's not really worth it um

168
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,240
worthwhile

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,639
using it

170
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,000
obviously if you still submit that

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
you've already purchased or maybe it's

172
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,960
been rolled into one of your products it

173
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,160
doesn't mean that you can't meet the

174
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,960
criteria but uh

175
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,360
you know you can still deliver on some

176
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
of those things and you should still

177
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
look into it and if you end up

178
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
finding that say you're using a theme

179
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
and you're using that sort of automated

180
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
capabilities with that you're going to

181
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,919
hit a wall at some point maybe that's

182
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,600
when you sort of say now it's time to

183
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
invest in soar as a natural sort of

184
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
platform

185
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,319
once you've chosen the solar platform uh

186
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,280
you're going to want to get everyone

187
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
involved you're going to want that from

188
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,520
you know day one really you don't just

189
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
want a sore team that works in splendid

190
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
isolation so

191
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
everything you produce is going to have

192
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,199
an impact even if you don't realize it

193
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,880
it's really easy to get carried away

194
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,479
with you know solving those first few

195
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,160
problems that you see and you actually

196
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,600
don't realize the impact that it's had

197
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,080
on the wider business so if you focus on

198
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,319
only one individual or one team you're

199
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,479
going to get quite a blinkered view

200
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,319
of the real impact of the problem as it

201
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,400
as it relates just to them

202
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
but that can actually end up causing

203
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
your problems down the line so

204
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
you know think about that as a simple

205
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
example you might have um

206
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,639
the saw is looking at seam alarms it's

207
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,000
enriching some of the data and then

208
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,759
it'll go put some sort of remediation in

209
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
place and then you know it's going to

210
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,039
happen in a couple of seconds

211
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,319
this might be saving your first and

212
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
second line some time and effort making

213
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,720
them have a better job it's also going

214
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,599
to reduce the potential impact on mtr

215
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,800
and ttr of the given indicator or you

216
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
know security incident

217
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,599
but

218
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,880
at the first line really going to have

219
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
considered things like when the ioc

220
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720
should be timed out and removed from

221
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,400
that block list or

222
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
who needs to know that the block's been

223
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
put in place you know does an itsm

224
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
solution need to be updated for reports

225
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
and things like that so

226
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,039
the more people we get involved when we

227
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,960
identify a problem and a potential you

228
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
know sore solution

229
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
the more likely we are to get us right

230
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
the first time so and that comes from

231
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
knowing your stakeholders knowing who

232
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,080
you need to deliver deliver the

233
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
successful implementation it goes beyond

234
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
the development and the automation and

235
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
you know you need to get involved with

236
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,120
process analysts you need to get

237
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
people that can track the pro the

238
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
progress of your implementations and you

239
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
know make sure that it's successful and

240
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,479
that they're delivering value so

241
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,840
on top of that you're gonna need

242
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
political buy-in from stakeholders

243
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
you're gonna need

244
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,240
people in the c-suite that can sort of

245
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
say get it done you're gonna

246
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
really need to make sure that you've got

247
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
as many people backing it as possible to

248
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,599
make sure that you don't get stuck with

249
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
those blockers last thing you want is a

250
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,080
backlog of cool stuff that you've made

251
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,240
and some sort of politics is holding it

252
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,960
up

253
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,240
so

254
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,000
soon you get those people involved

255
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,199
sooner you're going to achieve value

256
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,800
from use cases

257
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
uh when i say use cases key distinction

258
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,840
here for me is

259
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
playbook is just submit that does the

260
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
doing it takes an input it does some

261
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,639
cool stuff and it makes an output a use

262
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
case encapsulates that solution that

263
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,720
little bit of technology the playbook

264
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,840
but it's also all those other

265
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,599
dependencies the stakeholders the

266
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,759
sign-offs the definition of done you

267
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,759
know all your requirements and how often

268
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,599
it's delivered as well also

269
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,919
for me thor is about delivering use

270
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,958
cases not just playbooks so

271
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,599
uh internal politics really is the sort

272
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
of biggest pain point for for me when it

273
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,240
comes to sort of delivering tours my

274
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
internal companies external companies

275
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,519
whatever it is

276
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,680
if you can find the right person

277
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,519
you can often sort of

278
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,680
expedite the delivery of things but

279
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
you've actually got to go out there and

280
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
find them so make sure you do do things

281
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,279
like stakeholder mapping like really try

282
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,680
and find who the key holders are who are

283
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,279
the people that are responsible for

284
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,120
making sure that you can get those

285
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,200
credentials to a.d that you can put that

286
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
block in place because it's been

287
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,000
pre-approved that sort of thing

288
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
uh with that as well it's you know

289
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
the more people you've got involved the

290
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,800
more experts that you've got

291
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
connections to thor engineers or your

292
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
developers that are making your use

293
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,880
cases and helping build out your sole

294
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
platform

295
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,279
they're not necessarily needing to be

296
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,480
network engineers or you know proxy

297
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
theme firewalls sort of streams whatever

298
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
they just need access to those people so

299
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,519
the more people we're bringing on board

300
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
the more likely we're going to get these

301
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
sort of right decisions made when we're

302
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
implementing a block or responding to

303
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,680
alarm you know so

304
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,959
think of it this way

305
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
would you rather have your team able to

306
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,560
send you know a simple message an email

307
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
or something like that and a proxy get

308
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,160
block gets put in place

309
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
or follow a more traditional method

310
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,839
where you say

311
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,200
you know what let's raise the ticket and

312
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,440
then we'll wait until someone finds that

313
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,519
ticket picks it up reads it and then

314
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,959
goes action it

315
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
with saw you can get that response in

316
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,959
seconds and you can actually empower

317
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
people that have no knowledge of how to

318
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
use a proxy system a theme system

319
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,760
whatever it is to actually go do things

320
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,160
with it you know get that remediation

321
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,000
pull back that log data or whatever it

322
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,959
is so

323
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,279
yeah for me by having those experts in

324
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,760
the first place you can use

325
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
their expertise put it into your soil

326
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,079
platform and then empower other team

327
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,320
members to sort of essentially get a

328
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
self-service capability for

329
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
you know various security tools

330
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,360
um

331
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
this is pretty true as well when it

332
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,000
comes to intel decisions so if you're

333
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
making a decision on fret intelligence

334
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
like you know if if

335
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
indicator is found in list go do

336
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
remediation

337
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,360
make sure that it's not your development

338
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,920
engineers and making the choice on what

339
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,079
is bad and what is good don't just rely

340
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,839
on a tool or an open source intelligence

341
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,920
list or whatever it is saying this is

342
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
bad make sure you get your friend

343
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,360
intelligence team involved or your ir

344
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
team or whatever to actually really

345
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
classify those iss that you might be

346
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,800
making um

347
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,320
a decision on

348
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,279
so

349
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,600
uh and then finally for me like uh i've

350
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,959
talked about you sort of saw team as

351
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,120
maybe something a little bit separate so

352
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,079
a strong saw team for me should involve

353
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,519
your engineers that's someone that's

354
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,519
going to build out those playbooks and

355
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,040
really understand all the functionality

356
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,160
of orchestrations can help sort of train

357
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,680
you're going to need

358
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,040
people that are good at integration

359
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
someone that can actually

360
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,399
go out there have the conversations and

361
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,240
make sure that you can connect your saw

362
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,600
environment

363
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,360
to your av environment to your theme

364
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,519
environment to your firewalls so you can

365
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,680
start pulling in commands from each of

366
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
them and actually you know

367
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,680
some of some of the parts is essentially

368
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,279
greater than the hole or whatever it is

369
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,959
so uh

370
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,639
and a bpa as well you're gonna need

371
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,079
someone that can come in a business

372
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
process analyst uh

373
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,680
and do what needs to be done go find

374
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,160
those stakeholders out work out what the

375
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,519
problem is in the first place and

376
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,440
actually get that mapped out and make

377
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,279
sure that you

378
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,880
are delivering value but you're also

379
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,160
sort of mapping that and you're able to

380
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
communicate it to your stakeholders as

381
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
well

382
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,800
uh and

383
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
bonus on top of that anyone that's got

384
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,000
strong people skills people might get

385
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
upset about saw being rolled out they

386
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
might feel threatened by it so sometimes

387
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,440
you need someone that can kind of help

388
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
you there

389
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
measure success for me is one of those

390
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,880
really important things once you've got

391
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,639
everyone involved and you've got a

392
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,480
platform you actually need to know that

393
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,320
you're being successful i think we need

394
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,760
to move away from those you know

395
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,320
traditional sla type monitors and start

396
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
using the platform for what it is you

397
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
can actually develop metrics in-house

398
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,120
for

399
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,000
how you deem us your saw program to be

400
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,720
successful and record them in the

401
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,560
platform so you've got access to them

402
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,399
real time you might have a you know web

403
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
app access and and phone app access

404
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,480
where you can look at that you know at

405
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
any time of day and go yeah we're

406
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
actually really getting benefit from

407
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
from this platform so if you develop

408
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,519
your metric

409
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
try and make sure that it's recorded in

410
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,160
your playbook uh in your use cases use

411
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
that sort of concept of metadata to

412
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,480
record your success as well as go out

413
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,720
there and do the security thing that you

414
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
want it to um

415
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,839
i've got three examples that we can sort

416
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,920
of say here at the moment so we know

417
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
that we've saved someone 18 hours with

418
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,760
one playbook because it'll take on

419
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,120
average 18 hours to do the thing

420
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,519
manually or in the traditional way

421
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,519
and we can do it in about five minutes

422
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,360
so we save them 18 hours every time that

423
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
runs

424
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
equally so i can tell you last month you

425
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,800
know we're running close to 6 000

426
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,519
use cases in automation so it seems like

427
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
decent metrics

428
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,079
and that with a single set of use cases

429
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,360
we saved 60 grand a year in labor but

430
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,880
you know are these actually what they

431
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,279
seem money seems great until it becomes

432
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,120
a stick to beat you with if for the

433
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,360
platform cost you a certain amount do

434
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,959
you end up having to

435
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,880
save the equal amount in label to

436
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
actually pay off your own platform

437
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,680
because i know that

438
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
people aren't measuring their av and

439
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,399
their theme platforms like this and

440
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,040
there is a scene a security platform

441
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,600
this is an investment

442
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,399
focusing too much on money as a metric

443
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
it sort of means as well you end up

444
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,480
focusing on time and labor saved and not

445
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,560
necessarily the things of the best

446
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,800
security benefit

447
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
uh equally so 18 hours time saved it

448
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,720
seems seems great until you realize that

449
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,399
this is probably going to be an outlier

450
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,720
in most organizations so

451
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,959
does this mean that if you create your

452
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,279
next playbook and your metric if time

453
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,760
saved well when the next playbook use

454
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,519
case takes four hours

455
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,199
and then the next one

456
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,120
developed only saves

457
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,279
10 minutes things like that these are

458
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,240
gonna look awful by comparison right so

459
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,040
make sure that your keyhole stakeholders

460
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
when they see these metrics they see

461
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
positivity they see that reinforcement

462
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,519
of of success and value

463
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,920
money and time you you're

464
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,199
not going to keep that that's

465
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,959
consistently high once you've got those

466
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,440
sort of big wins out of the way

467
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,320
uh

468
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,399
use cases ran a month as well

469
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,920
it seems pretty cool you're like oh yeah

470
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,480
we've you know done nearly 6 000 use

471
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,680
cases but

472
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,839
really who cares there's no value in

473
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,519
that number right

474
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,040
what are the use cases what are they

475
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
automating what was the impetus behind

476
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,399
putting the use case there in the first

477
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,519
place so

478
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,079
we could run 10 playbooks in that

479
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,000
you know nearly 6k

480
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,199
and

481
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
they could have huge impacts save the

482
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,680
company from a natural compromise and

483
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,959
you know

484
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,560
they're valuable but they're lost the

485
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
next 5750

486
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
might just be closing false positives so

487
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,839
even though metrics seem really cool and

488
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,440
seem like they're going to show that

489
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,720
success

490
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
really try and think about

491
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
well

492
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,959
what is it that we're

493
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,480
really trying to get across and what is

494
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
it that we want to be measured by

495
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
a bit of an example of that this from

496
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
the real world um we had saw informing a

497
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,240
customer of an event uh within literal

498
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,160
seconds of it occurring

499
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,600
and it took the

500
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
humans that were kind of monitoring that

501
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
event and creating tickets around it in

502
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,160
the 90s platform another three and a

503
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,399
half hours to tell the same customer

504
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,560
about that data and about that event

505
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,040
that had occurred

506
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
that three and a half hours was still

507
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,560
within sla so by those traditional

508
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,320
measures yeah well done that's that's a

509
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
security success right that serves as a

510
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
success

511
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,759
but in real time that's potentially you

512
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,800
know three and a half hours that an

513
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,079
attacker could have been dwelling on the

514
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,440
network so

515
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,800
for me using saw it's time to get rid of

516
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,160
those traditional metrics as slas and

517
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
really move towards that sort of like

518
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,399
what's the value we can bring it's that

519
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,120
resolution doing that thing in seconds

520
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,040
not hours you know so

521
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,120
choose your metric

522
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,680
i think mttr's probably one of the best

523
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
ones and then

524
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,359
once you've chosen it stick with that

525
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,240
um

526
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,079
one of the old managers i work with sort

527
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,720
of

528
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,559
said the last thing we need to do is

529
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
automate chaos and it kind of really

530
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
stuck with me so

531
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,400
when we are choosing what we're going to

532
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,959
want to uh automate you've really got to

533
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,880
understand why you're doing it and what

534
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
it is that you're going for you know

535
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,280
don't don't just

536
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
try and automate as much as possible in

537
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
one go pick the things that have those

538
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,039
values that meet those metrics that we

539
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
sort of just talked about

540
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,520
we want to understand the actual goal of

541
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
the thing that's being automated if

542
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,600
we're looking into a process just

543
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,919
because it works one way now

544
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
doesn't mean that's the way it has to

545
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,360
work as an automation

546
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,919
we really want to focus on

547
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,320
what's the input what's the output and

548
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,039
kind of don't worry you can use your saw

549
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,160
platform to do the process bit of it

550
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
so

551
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,200
an example here

552
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
uh we had a request in to essentially

553
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
create a single pane of glass which can

554
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,840
be achieved for this specific example in

555
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,200
a solar platform

556
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
pull in all the alerts and the

557
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
priorities from different platforms put

558
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,280
it on the single dashboard so we could

559
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,799
achieve that

560
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,400
it seemed like a pretty good goal but

561
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
then when we started sort of

562
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,000
workshopping out with the customer we

563
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,280
realized that the reason that they

564
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
wanted to see everything in one place is

565
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
that they could tell people to respond

566
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
to it a little bit faster so we soon

567
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,360
realized there that even though the goal

568
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,679
seemed to be a single plane of glass

569
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,320
dashboard it wasn't the real goal was

570
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,280
response and a faster response so then

571
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,600
instead we started working on how can we

572
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
close those alarms down close those

573
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
alerts down and actually resolve them

574
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
because if you can access that data you

575
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
can probably go do something about it so

576
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
by implementing saw for them we were

577
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
able to say

578
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,039
yeah you can have that visibility if you

579
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,640
want but you can also have the

580
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,120
resolution happening before you even

581
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,520
sort of get the chance to see it so

582
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,120
really for me

583
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,400
not automating chaos is all about making

584
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,679
sure that the thing you're automating is

585
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
following the sort of correct reasoning

586
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,919
that it's not just uh

587
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,600
trying to

588
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
automate the thing that's done now but

589
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
it's trying to automate the reason for

590
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,960
the thing that's done now getting the

591
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
correct output not necessarily following

592
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,080
up the same process

593
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,120
so

594
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
once you know what you want to make you

595
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
need to start making it so slowly does

596
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,559
it right

597
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,600
uh the way that we deliver that is an

598
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,559
incremental steps right so we'll take a

599
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,240
use case and we'll break it down it

600
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,600
might be the first thing that we do is

601
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
focus on an action from that playbook so

602
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,720
can we get the data from one place and

603
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
present it to the user in an in in

604
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,799
another place we're getting that value

605
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,559
straight away we don't have to be all

606
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,960
singing and dancing once we know that's

607
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
working it's working consistently then

608
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,880
actually we might want to enrich it okay

609
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,120
we've got the data can we add some more

610
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,039
uh information from a cmdb another

611
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,360
security solution that sort of thing

612
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,840
deliver that get it consistent save

613
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
people's time because they're able to

614
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
use that enriched data and you've maybe

615
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,600
saved them 60 of their job

616
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,679
then move on to respond actually take

617
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
those playbooks and

618
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,679
sort of say well now that we know what

619
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,960
the data is and we know that we're

620
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,360
consistently getting it and that our

621
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,039
users are able to

622
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,000
react to the data that we've enriched

623
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,440
can we can we just make that decision

624
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,799
for them in the first place can we go

625
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
put that remediation in place so you

626
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,039
then you build it into respond you do

627
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,840
not have to do everything out the bag

628
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,080
make those small wins collect that value

629
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
early doors and you're gonna

630
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,840
see that actually you know slowly does

631
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,919
it it's a much faster way of delivering

632
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,039
your value

633
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,280
and then look at reuse the beauty of saw

634
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,919
is

635
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,600
everything you

636
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
build kind of fits in like you know bit

637
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,159
of a building block or a jigsaw when you

638
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,000
develop one solution it might be that

639
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,480
multiple teams can use it or that

640
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
actually if you've got something that

641
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
can go put a proxy block in place well

642
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
is there another use case it can use

643
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,120
that so

644
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
the more incremental building blocks

645
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,720
that you use the more that you've got to

646
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
sort of play with and actually

647
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,400
start delivering your value

648
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,799
later even faster so

649
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,960
definitely sort of take it slowly take

650
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,679
it

651
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
incrementally and you know building

652
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
those iterations essentially basically

653
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,840
like

654
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,880
agile one of the ways that we're sort of

655
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,520
talking about slow delivery as well is

656
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
making sure that you've got that

657
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,360
priority don't rush into it don't try

658
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,320
and take

659
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
everything on all at once and try and

660
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
deliver everything in parallel right if

661
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
you try and deliver like say 11 use

662
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,080
cases at once you're just going to find

663
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,919
that your context switching too much

664
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,440
you're only showing gradual gains and

665
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,720
stakeholders will start getting

666
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
frustrated and you really don't realize

667
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
the value until much further down the

668
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
line by actually slowing down and sort

669
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,640
of

670
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,159
taking on

671
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,840
just what your team can do you can start

672
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,320
to realize your value a lot sooner if

673
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
you focus on two or three

674
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
priority

675
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
use cases and you start delivering them

676
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
you deliver them faster then you're

677
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,559
claiming that value of it

678
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,799
much earlier so it's a serial sort of

679
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,200
development and incremental development

680
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,159
i feel

681
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,159
even though it's gonna seem slower to

682
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,000
your stakeholders is actually a much

683
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
faster way of getting success from soar

684
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,480
and people struggle with a priority

685
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
thing sort of like this concept of

686
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,400
if everyone's got a fast pass no one's

687
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,919
got a fast pass right if everyone's

688
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,520
coming to you and going

689
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,200
my thing's a higher priority then

690
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,480
nothing's highest priority if

691
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
everything's high priority so you've got

692
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,200
to be pretty strict in sorting out what

693
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,679
your priorities are whether that's money

694
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,120
mttr

695
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
who's asking but make sure you do that

696
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
and you know learn to say no to the

697
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,919
people saying i need this thing now

698
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,440
because all it's going to do the more

699
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,280
you take on the faster you try and work

700
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,640
the slower you're going to get that

701
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,679
success than that value

702
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,320
so yeah finally just to end um

703
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
you know what's my opinion also where do

704
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,159
we think we're going in the future

705
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,360
so is not something that we should be

706
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
worrying about if you've got those

707
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,640
problems and you get them in your

708
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
environment your sore team not just a

709
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
sole platform remember it's not a silver

710
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,360
bullet but your sword team and the

711
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,039
broader people that support you getting

712
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,600
everyone involved a sub program can be

713
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,280
those solutions

714
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,720
you're gonna get some profit you're

715
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,559
gonna get some value to your

716
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,360
organization by using it whether that's

717
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,520
reduced mttr you're gonna get happier

718
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,480
people whatever it is so i think rolling

719
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,039
out saw really can be a proper fresh

720
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,200
start it's a way to move away from

721
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,360
traditional metrics and do things for

722
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,559
the right reason not because they've

723
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,320
always been done that way you know oh

724
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
well we always put this into an excel

725
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,200
sheet and then into this and then to

726
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
this

727
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
is actually the data that you want just

728
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,400
like one thing that you could grab

729
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
straight away you know

730
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,120
think about actually doing things for

731
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,480
the reason that we're doing them not

732
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,440
just because it's the way that it's

733
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
always done

734
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,679
uh i think with saw we're gonna have to

735
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,360
start using that as you know in our rfps

736
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
as well because

737
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,120
if products and security products don't

738
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
offer apis i don't think we should be

739
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,640
looking at taking them into our

740
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
organizations anymore we have to make

741
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,880
sure that the more security alerts

742
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,480
happen the less people that we can

743
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
employ to actually go look at them the

744
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,760
more

745
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,039
easily we need to be able to interact

746
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,360
with them so they're gonna need apis so

747
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
i really think soar should become a key

748
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,120
decision maker or will become a key

749
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,679
decision maker when coming to purchasing

750
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,880
security technologies as well so

751
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,919
um

752
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,919
yeah with that really i'd probably just

753
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,880
say

754
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,840
thanks for your

755
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,679
time hopefully you've got some of use

756
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,919
and if anyone does want to talk then

757
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,360
you can sort of hit me up on you know

758
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,720
linkedin twitter or something like that

759
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,760
and ask questions so

760
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,240
thanks a lot
