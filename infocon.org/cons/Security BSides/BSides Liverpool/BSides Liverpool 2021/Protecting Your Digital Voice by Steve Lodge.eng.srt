3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,120
previous

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,040
presenter type stuff so

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
i'm here today to uh to give you a bit

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,440
of an overview about a passion of mine

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,760
uh hopefully it might uh

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,279
strike a few chords with yourselves as

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,480
well uh around things so bear with me

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
it's a more of a

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
a journey

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,920
and a story rather than a sales pitch as

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,359
we'll say so

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,599
quick outline i'm just going to do some

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,480
uh welcomes and introductions and then

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,600
what we're going to look at trying to do

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
is trying to set a scene about

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
uh something you've lost something

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,120
that's precious to you and how it makes

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,280
you feel and then we'll get round to the

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,200
electronics bit of it a little bit later

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,480
on so

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,360
without further ado we'll go

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,719
on

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
so yeah this is my first time at b-side

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,399
so thanks to jen and everybody for

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,320
inviting me over thanks everybody for

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,840
coming over and

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
sitting and listening hopefully you'll

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,640
find this uh reasonably entertaining and

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,479
everything else

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,960
so as i said it's not a sales pitch

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
although it is related to a product that

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
i did help create for my severely

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,000
disabled son uh many many years ago time

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,520
for still from just a bit about the

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,159
journey that we've been on um over the

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,520
last

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,080
10 years or so

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,439
so as i said hopefully you'll find it

41
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
thought provoking

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
maybe challenging in a in a

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,280
in a positive way and

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
maybe who knows inspiring and

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
uh dare to say for my side anyway

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
life-changing as you'll find out with me

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,240
as we get through

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
so quick introduction uh as we said i'm

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
steve lodge i've been a um

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
a techie since i was about 14 and

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,799
working on computers and technology and

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,000
electronics and software development and

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
got into

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
problem solving and

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240
a deep down i guess i'm a lot like

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,159
many people in the room you know taking

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
a heart with a passion trying to do

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,160
stuff trying to fix things trying to

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,440
make things work trying to make things

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
better trying to protect people

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
and all those types of things

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
and

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
so

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,920
so

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,440
as i said

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,720
i went all the way through my career

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,959
eventually i had a family and

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,840
you know

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,480
great achievement first unborn

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
but unfortunately for callum i found out

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,640
it was really disabled and

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,430
and uh

73
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,640
[Music]

74
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,440
and

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,720
as a result uh you know we've stuck with

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
trying to reach out to callum and what

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
we can do about

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,440
making his life better making the

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
family's life better and everything else

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
like that we all know about stephen

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,280
hawkins and the uh the brilliance and

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
his electorate communication device how

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
you know the world wouldn't be uh uh

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
where it is right now if

85
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,080
professor hawkins didn't have the

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,159
ability to express himself and come up

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,599
with the theories and present those

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,640
theories etc you know there's countless

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,480
tens of thousands or millions of people

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
that not always afforded that right

91
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
which is why you know i kind of came up

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,879
with the speak to me concept and trying

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
to do that

94
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,400
there's a little picture of

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,959
callum using one of his uh he speaks to

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
me is using drag and drop texts

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
images and text-to-speech to create

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,879
words and phrases that helps him so she

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,519
counts as this he guesses asking you for

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,560
a drink

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,799
well tell him what he eats

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,319
five things and drinks one thing and he

103
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,080
drinks pure orange juice

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
so if you give him tea or

105
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,640
coca-cola or whatever it is you won't

106
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,040
drink it obviously that gets him upset

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
and frustrated which again is why we're

108
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,360
looking at using technology using what's

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,599
out there to give

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,159
children like callum an adult site

111
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,640
or as adults like helm is now

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,319
an opportunity to express themselves

113
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
so just put yourself into the position

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,480
of i'm sure as we've all grown up we've

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,879
lost something of value you know

116
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,959
house keys your wallet credit cards

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,080
car whatever it is just imagine how you

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,880
feel when that happens you know you

119
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
get a sense of dread

120
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,880
uh you know get anxious you get stressed

121
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,479
you get worried

122
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,800
all those types of things probably get

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
angry and you know yourself for whatever

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,199
has happened type of thing

125
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,000
and

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
callum lives with that

127
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,280
concept all the time you know he's

128
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,600
always in that particular mindset of you

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
know not being able to uh

130
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
to be stressed and

131
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,759
concerned things like that

132
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,639
so

133
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,120
as i say you know you could potentially

134
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
lose something even more valuable you

135
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
know friendships relationships family

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,720
life

137
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
or as i say in challenge situation

138
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,160
lose your voice

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,759
so i thought the uh thing and tried to

140
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,360
make it a bit more interactive and

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
knowing that i got a close lunchtime

142
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
slot i thought well i know we've got

143
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,800
social distance and everything else so

144
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,479
we'll see how this works out

145
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
but i thought we'd do a quick exercise

146
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,039
and

147
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,479
so imagine that you wake up from a dream

148
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,720
the dream that you were having was

149
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
you've lost your voice

150
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,039
but the actual thing is you really have

151
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,960
lost your voice so everyone in the

152
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,759
room's lost their voice

153
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,320
makes it really difficult

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,880
so imagine then that you can't speak you

155
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,199
can't write you can't text message you

156
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,560
can't i am chat you can't draw

157
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,039
how would you communicate

158
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,360
how would you tell people what you what

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
you want what you need how you feel it

160
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,639
all those things that we take for

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
granted all the time

162
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,080
so just using basic pointing

163
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,720
or objects that we've got many of the

164
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,199
auditorium today or if you did have or

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
mining or all those types of things

166
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,520
remember to follow the rules

167
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
if you're in person or online

168
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
try and turn to the person next to you

169
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
or address it to you if you want to

170
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,440
participate and just try

171
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,880
tell them something about

172
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,400
some of your favorite food where you've

173
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,198
been on holiday

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,199
tv show

175
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,560
movie that you last saw if you ever went

176
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
down one now the cinemas are open

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,800
you want to give it a go

178
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,520
i can see some of you trying but

179
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,240
i guess what we'll all realize is that

180
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
it's really really difficult isn't it

181
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,840
you know without an object without a

182
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
point of reference without somebody to

183
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,440
interpret

184
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,160
using different cues and different signs

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,560
it's very difficult

186
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
but like i said that's the world that

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
callum and

188
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,960
children and adults like callum live

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,639
with on a daily basis tell them to

190
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,479
problem solve is amazing you will come

191
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,880
up with amazing things about wanting to

192
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,639
watch youtube that's his sign for

193
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,479
youtube

194
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,240
we had to figure that out but that's

195
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,599
what he meant by youtube so when he

196
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,120
wants to watch his youtube you might

197
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,319
want to watch

198
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,680
um

199
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,039
disney scar

200
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,800
battle sitting on youtube and he will

201
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
come up with a creative way of letting

202
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,680
his family know that that's what he

203
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
wants to try and do

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
well that's difficult when we know what

205
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
it is but if he goes to anywhere else he

206
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
doesn't know

207
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,720
they don't always know what his sign is

208
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
and he's communicating so that's why i

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,360
came up with kind of the concept

210
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,160
for speak to me

211
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,639
as i said you know we're saying that you

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
know my ministry has a fun

213
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,720
when it's at a party but if you have to

214
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
do that constantly all the time every

215
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
day of your life to get your needs met

216
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
to to to do those types of things

217
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
you know to do even do the basics to ask

218
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
for a drink or to go to the toilet or

219
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,479
whatever it is

220
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,280
you'd be struck and again you know the

221
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
brother public you know 99.99

222
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,599
of the population don't know sign

223
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,680
language you know i know basic sign

224
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
language a b c

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
d

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
type of stuff i can

227
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,560
pretty much put things together we know

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,479
basic signs for market on for more

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,319
various other stuff for caleb but again

230
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,919
when you go out in public

231
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
columns out and he's trying to do his

232
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,320
sign it makes it difficult and hence

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
that's why we kind of came up with the

234
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,279
concept for speech only

235
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
so like i said it's a communication

236
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
device it's really meant to be easy to

237
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,120
use

238
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
and uses drag and drops

239
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
pictures standardized images and

240
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
pictures text-to-speech engine and a

241
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,160
simple consistent user interface which

242
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
is what we wanted to try and help so

243
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,320
that people can get familiar with it

244
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,000
as you can see just use this little

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,920
object to drag and drop so it says

246
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
lots of children

247
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,000
and adults that have got autism and have

248
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,680
chopping slims they

249
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,240
tap either the hands or objects or

250
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,480
things like that so if having an object

251
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
on the screen and just tapping it all

252
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
the time just pull them fill the speed

253
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,399
up so the traditional communication

254
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,560
devices until speaking he came along

255
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,399
just no real good no real useful

256
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,440
calendar because he would fill the

257
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
screen up with i want i won't have what

258
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
i want i want i want what i want i want

259
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,560
that he would never get to what he

260
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
really wanted

261
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
there was

262
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,080
it helped support the intentional

263
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,959
communication which

264
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
we can also get it to work with uh eye

265
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,399
gaze so if you're in a wheelchair and

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
you can't use your hands for example you

267
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
have a tracking for guys stuff like that

268
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,000
you can work with various different

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
interfaces and other hardware

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,760
technologies and also you can have it in

271
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,519
different languages usually if pictures

272
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,440
are the universal you have it in

273
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
translated into different different

274
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,640
languages so you can have it in french

275
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
or german or chinese or

276
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,480
uh you know any

277
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
that we've got out there

278
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
so really what am i trying to do here is

279
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,640
i'm just trying to give everybody a bit

280
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,399
of a thing that says you know we're all

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,160
working busy hurried lives are all

282
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
challenging running around trying to do

283
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
things trying to live in trying to be

284
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
good people trying to help against the

285
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
black hats and everybody else type stuff

286
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,760
like that imagine if you've got an

287
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
electronic communication device that was

288
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
your only means of communication and it

289
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
got back to where you got

290
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,279
whatever happened to it

291
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,959
imagine having the benefit of hiring

292
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,480
your voice and all of a sudden having

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,839
each naturally away from you again and

294
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,279
things like that so it's one of the

295
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,120
things i'm really keen to try and look

296
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,839
at and trying to make these things more

297
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
resilient and better for the wider

298
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,600
community and things of that order

299
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
so what speaks to me is currently

300
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
operating on windows operating system

301
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,279
because that's what i was familiar with

302
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,120
but ideally you know i'd love to try and

303
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
get it onto an ios and android platforms

304
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
and things like that

305
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,640
so you know reaching out to the wider

306
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
community just saying this is my story

307
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,760
it's what i've done you know this is

308
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,200
what i'm trying to do

309
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,959
these are all the people and individuals

310
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,079
that are trying to help around the

311
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,560
country and around around the world so

312
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
if there's anybody out there anybody

313
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,200
online watching uh that's uh that's got

314
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
the time or talent or contacts or

315
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,279
whatever that wants to maybe reach out

316
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,920
to me have a conversation about it and

317
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
come up with some other ideas or

318
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,399
whatever and see if we can look at maybe

319
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,399
trying to get that into a wider audience

320
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
i mean lots of the uk schools have

321
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
invested heavily into

322
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
the uh the ipad platforms and those

323
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
other things of that order but you know

324
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,320
my concept was always to try and make it

325
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,639
you know that speak to me should be

326
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,240
you know universally available

327
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,839
regardless of operating system

328
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,760
regardless of technology uh you know

329
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,519
without getting into a sales pitch

330
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
around the price point that's

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
commercially viable and

332
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
out there if you're a single mum two

333
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,680
disabled non-verbal children on on

334
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,600
benefits or low incomes and things like

335
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
that you know really want to try and

336
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,720
make it that you know why should those

337
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
people be disadvantaged why should they

338
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,920
not be able to be able to use

339
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,000
foreign that's my passion and hopefully

340
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
you know others might ideally like to

341
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
share that as well

342
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
so

343
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,959
that's kind of my story uh that's where

344
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,518
i've come from

345
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
any questions

346
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
yeah

347
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
i did a long time ago i you know we

348
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
looked at maybe that concept and

349
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,880
you know i think we've looked at i think

350
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
unity we looked at phone gap when it

351
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,639
first came out i mean i've registered

352
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,880
the patents back in 2009.

353
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,240
you know we've got children that are

354
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
actually using and benefiting from

355
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
speaks me down in some special needs

356
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,120
schools in london

357
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
you know they were originally

358
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
got a low attainment level and their

359
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
targets were set at relatively modest

360
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,880
levels

361
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,760
but

362
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
they managed to get invest in a few

363
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
speakers get them out into the hands of

364
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,160
their children and they outperformed all

365
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,079
their targets across the board all the

366
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,120
children that were on there because

367
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
they've been able to express i mean you

368
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
imagine going to us going to a school

369
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,959
and not being able to communicate and

370
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,959
knowing all your all your times tables

371
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,720
but still being taught your times for

372
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,959
four years or two years when you already

373
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,320
understood that the first week you were

374
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,399
in school you know imagine how you would

375
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,480
feel like you couldn't express that and

376
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
that's what happens in a lot of cases

377
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,079
you know children individuals get

378
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,800
frustrated they get demotivated they

379
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,959
have challenging behaviors as a result

380
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,360
type of stuff and put something like

381
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,440
speak to me or other products like that

382
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
out there into the wider community

383
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,279
should help you know

384
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,760
do that

385
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,350
[Music]

386
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,279
that's a good question i mean from my

387
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,959
you know so

388
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,760
you know i've been a busy geeky dad for

389
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,680
you know 20 odd years with callum you

390
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,240
know i've i've gone to the time to spend

391
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,880
time learning complex manuals

392
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,079
you know i've come from a technical

393
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,240
background so you know that's relatively

394
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
straightforward and intuitive but you

395
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,160
know i put myself again some of the

396
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
speakers i said on some of the besides

397
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
topics before you know trying to keep it

398
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,720
simple so simple user interface easy to

399
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,800
configure consistent

400
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,440
uh and do those types of things so you

401
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
know it's it's three or four pages on

402
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,480
the pdf that you can download

403
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,040
tab file effects digital time file fixes

404
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,399
with um

405
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,079
with you know images on there you can

406
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
have pictures of photos and family

407
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,560
friends

408
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
you know i've got license agreements in

409
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,959
place with three or three of the top

410
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,600
four worldwide image

411
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
educational image components around the

412
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
world uh so they again so the children

413
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
go into special needs school to get

414
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
access to those particular image sets

415
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,760
they can then use those in class they

416
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,040
can use them consistently on their

417
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,160
um

418
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,079
yeah i mean it's certainly things that

419
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,920
we've i've kind of done i've self-funded

420
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
it all myself predominantly

421
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,040
because yeah you know i wanted to try

422
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,839
and

423
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
monetize it but you know i've got a

424
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,079
special needs child that eventually i'm

425
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,519
going to stop working and eventually i

426
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,240
will die unfortunately and you know

427
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,440
callum will be

428
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,839
40 50 years old

429
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,680
you know type of stuff and you know if

430
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,360
there is an opportunity to actually make

431
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,959
something put into a

432
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,480
you know a charitable foundation or

433
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,519
trust maybe create an opportunity where

434
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,920
we can have you know

435
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
living care centers that are based you

436
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
know sponsored by i don't know a speech

437
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,560
foundation or whatever that was my

438
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
ultimate vision type of stuff

439
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,759
but you know i'm not holding anything

440
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,639
off the table at the minute but uh you

441
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,720
know

442
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
i'm a single geeky dad just trying to do

443
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,519
the best i can to try and get you know

444
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,600
onto an ielts or an android platform

445
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,360
which obviously you know that's you know

446
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,079
the the new surface girls out and you

447
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,360
know so that's that's looking

448
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,680
encouraging and i've got it on

449
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
the surface as well and lots of other

450
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,560
things so

451
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,159
[Music]

452
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,319
yeah they're the three syllables

453
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,559
they it's known that the the the three

454
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,599
image sets that i so there's there's um

455
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,639
pcs which is

456
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,559
there's rigid symbols in the uk and the

457
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,919
symbol sticks

458
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,439
which is

459
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,599
the distinct the sigma

460
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,480
type derivative and that are used

461
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
predominantly they're they're the three

462
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
primary ones that are used there's also

463
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,720
a feature exchange communication system

464
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,799
pens symbol set and there's at the

465
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,600
market on sign symbol set which is

466
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
heavily used in lots of special needs

467
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,600
schools but market on tend to be very

468
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,879
conservative though when

469
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
you know so if you're going into an

470
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,000
education environment you're likely to

471
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
be using one of those one of those

472
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,640
certainly pcs

473
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,840
[Music]

474
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,440
yeah like anything else there's a

475
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
there's a there's a license fee to what

476
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,559
for each of the image sets but it's a

477
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,640
lot easier easiest to

478
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,480
reuse 20 30 40 000 image sets uh in

479
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
images that categorized and been created

480
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,360
and used heavily within the education

481
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,440
sectors or whatever so

482
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,919
again i was trying to be consistent with

483
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,720
you know what the children or the adults

484
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,799
are likely to use augment that by using

485
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
digital photos uh you know any any any

486
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,000
other thing that you want to import into

487
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
you need to speak to me you can also

488
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,679
record your own voice

489
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,919
uh for example and it's

490
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,640
versions like this

491
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
accents on them when i digitize all the

492
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,600
voices but obviously using

493
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
text-to-speech engines and computer

494
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,039
synthesized speech you can put different

495
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,480
accents on different dialects etc

496
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,840
from different languages

497
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,720
all right

498
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,720
yeah

499
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,480
straightforward

500
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,559
yeah i mean it's a good show i mean i've

501
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,080
tried reaching out to various different

502
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,320
organizations in in the past i was over

503
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
at uh my daughter's just started

504
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
university of huddersfield and uh

505
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
she went visiting for covered some of

506
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
the other campuses

507
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
i think my friend got

508
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,880
quite a good digital

509
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,520
technology center things like that but

510
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,039
again you know it's

511
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,960
it's just trying to find

512
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
you know somebody that's

513
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
you know i mean i as i said i'm a nice

514
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,919
software developer but i've coded for

515
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,520
like 10 or 15 years since i was looking

516
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
at the process on this

517
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,880
you know that was way about when time

518
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,600
for stuff and you know i know it's

519
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
basically dating well basically it's

520
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,640
some images

521
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,559
graphical user interface takes a speech

522
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,879
engine

523
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,240
apart from me learning to recode again

524
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,799
so things like that which you know i'm

525
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,240
still going through my side institute

526
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
assignments and security certifications

527
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
so maybe maybe next year i'll get on to

528
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,120
coding again time today but i've never

529
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
given up type of thing and that's one of

530
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
the things that we probably should all

531
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
take away is you know still believe in

532
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
the great idea concept how we can help

533
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,080
people how it can change lives and and

534
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,559
hopefully one day it'll

535
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,000
be

536
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,840
a lot more devices helping a lot more

537
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,639
individuals around the world

538
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,440
yeah i mean i mean there's the the

539
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
hearing community we've engaged with

540
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
i've worked with uh basically speaking

541
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,039
language before uh

542
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,400
some years ago

543
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
and again what we're trying to do is

544
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,320
just

545
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,520
get the get the device out there get the

546
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
antidotes i mean now it's in some of the

547
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,640
special knee schools in london and

548
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,480
various other places they've provided

549
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,159
some brilliant testimonies and an

550
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,240
evidence base about how it's reduced

551
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,480
behaviors how it's increased determines

552
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,080
how it's you know it's opened up the

553
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,919
educational pathways to

554
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
children uh especially these children

555
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,080
