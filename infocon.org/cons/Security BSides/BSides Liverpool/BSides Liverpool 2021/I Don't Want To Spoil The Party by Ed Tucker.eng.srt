1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,520
right afternoon

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,120
i stand between you and london so i can

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,160
be really quick if you want

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,320
don't honestly don't say that

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,000
we will be until seven

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
the pub's open already so um so i'm in

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,600
tucker uh

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
i've been an accountant i've worked on a

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
help desk i've been head of cyber in

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,000
government i've been a vendor i've been

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,880
a founder of startup and back to a cso

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,599
and

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,040
everywhere in between so i've been a

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,360
defender a vendor and a defender again

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,239
um

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,399
i don't tend to kind of toe the party

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,640
line when it comes to cyber security

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
um frankly because most of it's rubbish

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
and hopefully we'll just talk around a

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,960
few things that hopefully resonate might

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,879
not from my personal experiences through

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,079
life uh and have managed hopefully

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
to get the beatles stream throughout

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,839
to start off kind of

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,680
almost everything that you see in the

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
industry today

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,119
expert analysis articles webinars

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,119
conference speakers

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,960
obviously

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
it's all actually kind of driven by

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,000
people who are trying to sell you

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,600
something

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
how many times do you see

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,880
expert insight from the people who do

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,000
the day job

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
when i talk about the day job that's my

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,439
day job as a cso as a head of cyber as

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,680
an analyst as a defender to actually do

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,200
it

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
how much of the insides is actually paid

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,159
to play

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,759
you know you're top right of the gardner

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,360
magic quadrant

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
i've been a startup founder

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,840
we could have entered gartner

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
we couldn't afford it it's kind of it's

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,119
a bit weird because if you've got a good

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,479
solution shouldn't they just look at it

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,759
in every way and that sort of start now

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,759
that could be forested whichever or

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,280
whichever analyst forum wants to have a

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,520
look at certain products um there's a

53
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
certain amount of skin you have to put

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
in the game just to be considered

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
it's really hard to do it without

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
joining the club

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,680
how many webinars are front-ended with a

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
presentation from a vendor that just

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
kind of runs through

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,439
exactly what they offer you

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
rather than

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,478
what's possible on this subject matter

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
how many articles do you read

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
where the expert insights are out

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,879
there's articles is from

66
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,319
people again who are trying to sell you

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,440
something it's not from the people who

68
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,879
actually do it there's a major

69
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,480
vulnerability let's get some insight

70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
from x vendor x vendor x vendor and x

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
consultant and ex twitter expert

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
rather than someone that actually knows

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
the practicality of how to we address a

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,239
vulnerability how do we put business

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
context to someone that's got a huge

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,160
backlog to go through

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,319
that's got features to deliver features

78
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,560
that are going to generate revenue or we

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
could stop them generating revenue and

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,200
say you need to patch this because

81
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,319
there's a vulnerability and it's been

82
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,879
exploited in the wild or some other

83
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,879
nonsense term that means nothing to

84
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,800
someone in business

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,239
oh there's a poc there it's been

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,599
exploited

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,599
what we do what's the business context

88
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
what's the real rationale how do i

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
prioritize how do i help people

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,959
understand it so we can make active risk

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,319
decisions

92
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
how many people actually talk about risk

93
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,599
and the different parameters that make

94
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,000
at risk

95
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,159
how many times you have people telling

96
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
you what you need

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,040
you need an insider threat program

98
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
you need a next generation firewall

99
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
you need to consider the iot

100
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,840
or computers as they're otherwise known

101
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,080
you need education and awareness no you

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
don't need education and awareness it

103
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,280
doesn't work you need to fish your

104
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
employees you don't need to fish your

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,799
employees you need you need you need how

106
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
do they know what you need

107
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,799
how does anyone know what any one of you

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,760
people need i don't i could guess some

109
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
thematic things because they're

110
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
ubiquitous across the industry and areas

111
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,480
of concern

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,840
i don't know what you need because i

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
don't know your business i don't know

114
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,799
your people i don't know what you do i

115
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,319
don't know your appetite does anyone

116
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,000
have a risk appetite is it literally a

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
finger in the air medium or seven

118
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
is it a genuine risk appetite because do

119
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,439
we actually understand our risk and all

120
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,640
the different parameters that change

121
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
constantly not because the threat is

122
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
exponential no because changes

123
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
technology changes people change

124
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,720
circumstances change pressure changes

125
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,478
stress changes

126
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
and yes there are more exploits and

127
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,240
there are more cyber criminals the vast

128
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,919
majority of which are opportunistic

129
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,000
shifters to spaft across the internet

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
not high-end adversaries

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
but if i just tell you you need to be

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,759
wary of that's just spaffed off the

133
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,000
internet you won't buy something off me

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
you won't buy my consultancy you won't

135
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
buy my

136
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,639
startups you won't buy my products

137
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,680
because i'm actually talking to you

138
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,520
about the majority of stuff the 80 20

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
rule in fact it's probably about the 98

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,960
2 rule

141
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
to beware experts

142
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
they are not always what they seem

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,080
there are many many many experts in

144
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,840
cyber security

145
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,880
many

146
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,919
there are many of them with blue ticks

147
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,160
that means on

148
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
absolutely that's because i've not got

149
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
one no seriously it means nothing needs

150
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,520
nothing um how many people in this room

151
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,560
have heard of a guy called gary

152
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
stevenson

153
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,800
one

154
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
two

155
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,360
so gary sivaneson he's ex-gchq

156
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,639
ex-intelligent services

157
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
ex head of cyber for lockheed martin

158
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
when they went through the genuine apt

159
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
awakening

160
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,240
when they came up with things like the

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,919
kill chain that everyone now spaffs

162
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,759
around

163
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,960
when they actually coin kind of things

164
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,479
like apt which everyone gets

165
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,120
fundamentally wrong

166
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,440
he then went on to be uh the director of

167
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,520
cyber for ea games everyone ever heard

168
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
of them yeah

169
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,320
they lost the source code to fifa

170
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,919
recently didn't they

171
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,759
i'll tell you now giri is one of the

172
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
best cyber people on the planet

173
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,039
by a distance and so is his team

174
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
and they lost the source code for fifa

175
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,319
that doesn't mean they're rubbish at

176
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,759
security

177
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,039
that means basically it can happen to

178
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,120
anyone but guilty vanessa isn't a blue

179
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
tick on twitter

180
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,919
he's not someone you see at every

181
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,199
conference he's not someone you've seen

182
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,960
articles he's someone that i go to

183
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680
constantly to have conversations with

184
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
because he really really

185
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
really knows his stuff he's lived and

186
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
breathed it he's got it wrong probably

187
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
more than he's got it right and he'll

188
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,080
happily put his hand up and say yes i

189
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,599
will do we'll get it wrong

190
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
i won't generally go to the people who

191
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,120
are in the articles because it's the

192
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
same people over and over and over and

193
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
over and over and over and over again

194
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
who seem to have a comment on every

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,160
single subject which means they're

196
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,720
either a genius or they're full of

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
or somewhere in between

198
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
somewhere in between maybe

199
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,039
but there's a lot of it about

200
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
mixed with them telling you that you

201
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,759
need stuff don't get me wrong some of

202
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
them are very clever very well skilled

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
but they are also playing a game

204
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,599
they're playing a game to pull you in to

205
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
spend money

206
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,919
you are always going to have to invest

207
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,759
in security it doesn't always have to be

208
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,520
financial or directly financial

209
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,479
the trouble is most of what we see is a

210
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
helicopter view

211
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
a helicopter view 30 000 foot this is it

212
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
you need a champion's network

213
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
great i know what that is that's a good

214
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,199
thing we had them in hmrc after the dis

215
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,280
loss in 2007 so we had a champions

216
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,199
network in 2008.

217
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,400
hmrc that's government jesus christ were

218
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,440
we 13 years ahead of the rest of you no

219
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,599
it's something that's existed for ages

220
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,440
the difference is

221
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
how do you implement it why'd you

222
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
implement it what's its purpose we

223
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
implemented it and it ran the business

224
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
to an absolute hot

225
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,639
because we didn't know what we were

226
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,080
doing no one did at the time we figured

227
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
it out and got better and it still

228
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,720
didn't work perfectly you know there

229
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,919
were kind of missionaries out in the

230
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,280
business who dealt with business data

231
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
and development business decisions in a

232
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
hub and smoke model that came back to

233
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
center around security decisions

234
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,960
questions

235
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
queries

236
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,080
and we're kind of a face-off into the

237
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
business and it was a full part or a

238
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,599
full part of their job it was written

239
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,199
into their contracts it was written to

240
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,479
their objectives it's part of what they

241
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,000
do on a daily basis

242
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,759
there is a very different thing between

243
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,199
saying you need a champions network and

244
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,120
actually implementing one and actually

245
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,960
understanding what are the outcomes i

246
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
want to achieve when i do that

247
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
how do i measure the outcomes and i

248
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,560
don't mean kpis and crap like that or

249
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,319
we've lost one million things at the

250
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,840
email gateway

251
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,080
we've lost one million and two next week

252
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,759
and was that good bad or indifferent or

253
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
do i have no control over the internet

254
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
whatsoever

255
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
meaningful stats or am i trying to prove

256
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
that i spend a million pounds and

257
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,800
nothing happens trying to prove a

258
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,719
negative

259
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,279
genuine measurable outcomes

260
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,880
but what are the bits that make it there

261
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,559
the revolution is understanding

262
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,640
what i need to do to make a success

263
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
and a success can be literally one step

264
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
forward one step forward is still a step

265
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
forward better is still better perfect

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
it's unachievable

267
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
but to take that one step forward to get

268
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,080
better i need to

269
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,839
understand the components that get me

270
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,440
there

271
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
one of the best analogies i'd like to

272
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,560
talk about is

273
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
fishing simulations education and

274
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
awareness

275
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,959
just because it's a really simple one to

276
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
drive this home we all generally agree

277
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,040
that some awareness activities are a

278
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,320
good thing to do

279
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
yeah we're generally rubbish at them but

280
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,080
they are a good thing to do

281
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
you sometimes spend half an hour a year

282
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,440
on them which if that works my children

283
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,279
would go to school maybe for a week a

284
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,640
year and that's it

285
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,720
that doesn't work but never mind no one

286
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
wants to do it anyway and it's my job to

287
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,040
protect them so who cares

288
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
but let's pretend for a minute that we

289
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
make our people more aware they're now

290
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
aware of how to spot phishing emails

291
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
super what do they do

292
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
if they delete it

293
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
then the risk surely happens in their

294
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
inbox and i am blissfully unaware of it

295
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,160
so that's not good

296
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,399
ah we want to report it don't we yeah we

297
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,080
all get our users to report it brilliant

298
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
so now they're reporting

299
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,279
let's pretend as well they know how to

300
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,200
report it and to who

301
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,560
and how to forward an email as an

302
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
attachment to keep the headers intact

303
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
and things like that you know that

304
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,120
your nan could do because they are just

305
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
normal people with different skill

306
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,320
levels

307
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
so let's pretend they can do that

308
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
brilliant

309
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
how quickly do your team pick it up

310
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,880
what do they do with it how do they

311
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,399
investigate it do they have access to

312
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,680
things like exchange or do they have to

313
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
go to the exchange team if they want to

314
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,600
check if someone's clink tip do they go

315
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,399
to

316
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,680
next generation firewalls or they're

317
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
seen taller they have to work with

318
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
networks if they want to put block in

319
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,440
place can they do it themselves and they

320
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,959
have to go and work with another team

321
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,480
what are the dependencies to make that

322
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
happen what's the dwell time

323
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,839
how do they contact other users

324
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,279
really simple thing of i've spotted

325
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,880
efficient email because actually quite a

326
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,240
complex piece to do any kind of

327
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
measurable risk remediation of it

328
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
that involves teams outside of your

329
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
locus of control

330
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,839
how many if you consider that if you do

331
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,000
education and awareness

332
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,480
because you probably should

333
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,000
but someone will tell you you need an

334
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
education and awareness program

335
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
will they tell you you need to factor in

336
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
all these other aspects

337
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,839
well they tell you you need to work on

338
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,519
your operational procedures

339
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,959
will they tell you you need to work on

340
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,040
your apis between teams

341
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,480
of how you raise a ticket to the

342
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
exchange team bearing in mind they've

343
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,839
already got a full staff job load for

344
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,040
that day

345
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
how do you get into that list how do you

346
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
become a priority how do you work with

347
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,079
them most of which is relationships

348
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
but how do you do it

349
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
oh that's the difficult bit you need an

350
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,720
awareness program and you need our thing

351
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,360
with widgets and why do

352
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
almost every security company in the

353
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,079
world make products with the worst

354
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,920
interfaces possible

355
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,519
i mean genuinely it looks like we write

356
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,120
software from the 80s when it comes to

357
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,959
actually usability

358
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,920
you know

359
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
my two-year-olds could navigate navigate

360
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,120
an ipad

361
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,760
i need a phd just to understand the

362
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
dashboard

363
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
because even the language in it

364
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
we can work it out

365
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
generally speaking that's if we kind of

366
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
ignore

367
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,040
the noise

368
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,079
because most of it is unhelpful

369
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,519
because it doesn't tell you all the

370
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,040
different building blocks you need to

371
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
put in place to make a marked

372
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
improvement

373
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639
they don't tell you that you need to

374
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,279
empathize with your business people

375
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
they don't tell you that they don't care

376
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,160
they do care but they've got a day job

377
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,279
and generally speaking they've got a

378
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,800
really full day job

379
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,480
and i know that we're working remotely

380
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,000
and no that doesn't make the risk more

381
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
exponentially worse because all of a

382
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
sudden they're at home

383
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,480
people have worked from home for years

384
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,240
oh but now the perimeter is no longer

385
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
the perimeter yeah it hasn't been for

386
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,279
years if anyone remembers the jericho

387
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,880
forward if anyone's kind of old there's

388
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
a few older people in this room or you

389
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,760
might be really young and just had a

390
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,240
hard life

391
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,040
zero trust isn't a new thing

392
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,440
it's just be badged for the stuff deep

393
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
perimeterization and all that good stuff

394
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,839
they're good concepts they're hard

395
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,800
they're really hard to do

396
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
but a lot of things that you get told

397
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,040
out there simply don't work

398
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
you need to understand all of your

399
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
assets i think that's brilliant i also

400
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
think it's impossible

401
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,360
you can't you won't you can only

402
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,639
discover the assets that you can

403
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,920
actually discover

404
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,600
we can discover all your data apart from

405
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,959
the stuff that's in the safe over there

406
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,000
because that's not connected to a

407
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
network

408
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
oh yeah we can classify all your data

409
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,639
awesome what words we're going to use

410
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,000
confidential well that's a word that's

411
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,839
used actually normally does it mean

412
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
anything

413
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
corporate oh well that's used all the

414
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
 time what we're going to do with

415
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,560
that dlp is really hard they're all

416
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
things that are actually hard and

417
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,360
complex and i know people call it the

418
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,000
basics the basics are hard

419
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
they are

420
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
you know

421
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
we're getting to stages where people

422
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
kind of say don't pay ransoms let's make

423
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,079
paying ransoms illegal

424
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,839
fine cool all right let's blame the

425
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,720
victim

426
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
because you are a victim of crime

427
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
if we don't talk about well hang on a

428
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
minute we've invested billions of pounds

429
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,079
in offensive cyber security capabilities

430
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,079
why aren't we using those against the

431
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,240
very people who are screwing over all of

432
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,160
our businesses oh yeah but that's really

433
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
complex

434
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,199
uh what about kind of international law

435
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,880
enforcement you know cooperation oh

436
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
that's really complex yes i was

437
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,240
protecting myself from ransomware as

438
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,480
well all right if i expose rdp i'm a bit

439
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
of a dick but

440
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,279
sometimes it's hard because people can

441
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,720
make change guess what people in your

442
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,320
organization can make change and they do

443
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,160
it every day and sometimes they go for

444
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
the easy answer not necessarily the

445
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
simple answer easy answer because it's

446
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,279
easy

447
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,519
and it's hard to stay on top of that

448
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,040
it's not always our job

449
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,279
but it is complex

450
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,399
and the way we actually start to

451
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,399
overcome some of this is to actually

452
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,399
sorry it's the 45th anniversary edition

453
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
of this because again none of this is

454
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,240
new we come together and we talk

455
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,880
but i don't tell you that i've just done

456
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
an awareness campaign it's fun and

457
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
awesome and it's absolutely brilliant

458
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,120
and everyone engaged with them is

459
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
absolutely super and you know i did this

460
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
and i did some videos it was brilliant

461
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,959
because that's not the truth i tell you

462
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,199
what we did what pitfalls we hear how

463
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,720
many people really engage with it the

464
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
problem we have with cutting people

465
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
engaged how we try all the different

466
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,120
mechanisms and everything that might get

467
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,199
people more engaged what kind of worked

468
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,040
in some of our areas and didn't work in

469
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,639
others and you tell me what works in

470
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
yours and between us maybe ah you know i

471
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,399
might try that i might try that and see

472
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,680
if it works it might not work in my

473
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
environment because my environment is

474
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
unique your environment is unique yours

475
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,120
is unique and all of yours are unique

476
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,519
every single business is unique

477
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,240
that might sound like bollocks

478
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
but there's an exhaustive list as to why

479
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
your business is unique

480
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,560
you have different employees end of list

481
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
but maybe if we start talking to each

482
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,320
other properly and it's kind of scary

483
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,519
because i've got to admit then my

484
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,720
failings i've got to admit i've got

485
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,160
things wrong guess what i've got things

486
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,519
wrong all the time i've probably got

487
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,800
about seven or eight things wrong this

488
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
week

489
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,600
so i

490
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,519
we do that's how we learn hopefully we

491
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,720
don't make the same mistakes seven or

492
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,120
eight times next week the same ones

493
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
might do

494
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,680
i've got a bad memory especially when

495
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
i've been drinking

496
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
but if i admit my failings and maybe you

497
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,240
go well yeah i've had the same thing

498
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,839
right so what do we think how do we come

499
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,279
past it and actually we don't just talk

500
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,800
as a security community because then we

501
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,199
stayed in this little myopic sphere in

502
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,440
our own little echo chamber

503
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
we don't talk to those weird people over

504
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,160
there in

505
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,600
networks

506
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,720
finance and stuff

507
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,160
we have to have proper conversations and

508
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
grown-up and adult conversations

509
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
that's how we change it

510
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,440
not some tagline in a news article

511
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,959
or some webinar that's trying to sell

512
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,959
you this thing over here

513
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,959
you talk to real people some of them are

514
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
vendors some of them are consultants

515
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,560
some of them are managed service

516
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
providers because there are good people

517
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,199
in all of them and you'll find good

518
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,199
people to have proper conversations

519
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,880
gary sivanesen to me is one of those

520
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
people we have conversations all the

521
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,920
time

522
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,959
and even though he is genuinely someone

523
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,279
i really really really look up to he's

524
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,720
in my top three people in my

525
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
environment of kind of i.t business and

526
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,720
security that i really look up to

527
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,240
absolutely hold him on a pumpkin and he

528
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,400
asks me questions as well

529
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,160
because otherwise he lives in this

530
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
little myopic sphere on his own

531
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,199
so we have to come together and do it

532
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,799
differently

533
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,240
not just talk about coming together

534
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,439
things like this where we can actually

535
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,720
share things but things when we go out

536
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,240
there and share or when we're in the pub

537
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,359
or right dm over twitter or something

538
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,559
we can actually have proper

539
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,559
conversations and learn from each other

540
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
and genuinely listen if you held the two

541
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,240
up the wrong way mate

542
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,679
yeah i know you usually show me the

543
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,360
other way around that's it better thank

544
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
you um

545
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,679
i'm going to end it there

546
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,840
you've literally got kind of

547
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,039
a minute or so if you want to ask any

548
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,640
questions

549
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
but i might throw them back at you

550
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,880
and say does anyone else know the answer

551
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,799
go okay

552
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,360
yep

553
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
one thousand percent and a hashtag

554
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,720
doesn't sort it

555
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,600
a hashtag does not sort it

556
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
you know whichever ones you want to call

557
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
about whatever things are making for a

558
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
safe environment we make it a safe

559
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
environment by me allowing you to have

560
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,679
that idea

561
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,760
some people won't do it

562
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,880
all right someone said they'll never

563
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,120
work

564
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
 off

565
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
i allow you to have that idea and we

566
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
bounce it we bounce it we talk

567
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
it's hard to do it in a big forum

568
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,919
because there's always dissenting voices

569
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,360
and it gets drifting off and taken away

570
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
and it becomes all these things

571
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,880
you can collaborate but collaborate

572
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
small and then grow

573
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,280
and mostly ignore the dissenting voices

574
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
you know

575
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,840
there's a lot of people talk about

576
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
things like imposter syndrome which kind

577
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
of fits into that as well kind of i

578
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,360
don't want to share my idea because

579
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,320
most of the people out there have

580
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
 it the biggest skills that we

581
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,240
have in the cyber security industry and

582
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,120
i will

583
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
stake my life on this is the people

584
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
doing the job today

585
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
i'm sorry but it is

586
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,640
there are a lot of very very very good

587
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,600
people

588
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
there are a lot of people who are not as

589
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,000
good

590
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
find the people who are good find the

591
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
people that trust find the people where

592
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,039
you can have that conversation

593
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,520
the bounce ideas

594
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,200
the good people will pat you on the head

595
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
put their arm around you and talk about

596
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
the idea talk about what environments

597
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
how it might work challenge you to do

598
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
due diligence on your own ideas

599
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,919
you know and that's how we grow that's

600
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,400
how we get better

601
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
and we have to almost individually make

602
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
that safe

603
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,200
i don't think we can ever collectively

604
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,559
make that safe

605
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,840
there's too many vested interests over

606
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
do

607
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,320
[Music]

608

[Music]

610
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
what do you think

611
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
do you think silos teams

612
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,440
helps

613
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,799
um

614
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,689
[Music]

615
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,640
is

[Music]

617
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,120
challenge really comes from having a

618
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,559
management team that are prepared to

619
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,840
facilitate the cross silo

620
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,440
conversations

621
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,960
and then

[Music]

625
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,480
boundaries that don't end i agree with

626
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,919
your whole heart the only one bit i've

627
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
disagreed on i don't think it requires

628
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
management

629
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
ideally because

630
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,720
you can just do it

631
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
you can just talk to people

632
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,400
the one mentor i would always say

633
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,880
and it's an old one it's always easier

634
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,640
to ask forgiveness than permission it's

635
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,559
a lot quicker

636
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,320
you know some of the some of the best

637
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,480
relationships i had at hmrc was with

638
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,960
some of the architects in capgemini

639
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
because we recognized we could make each

640
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
other's lives easier just by talking and

641
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,760
we knew there was a point where we had

642
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,880
to have commercial discussions and

643
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
that's when we kind of stepped away but

644
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,039
before then if we talked

645
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,200
wow that made their changes a lot easier

646
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,240
to go through because there was less

647
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
assurance and armor to go

648
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,320
through and i got what i wanted and i

649
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,919
knew and i built trust relationships and

650
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,880
that was the cross boundaries that we

651
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,159
shouldn't have done

652
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,600
or i was in a little jurisdiction of

653
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
being a certain level of seniority but

654
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
my team members did it as well

655
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,840
you know empowerment is a

656
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,640
word not misused but mis-implemented

657
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
autonomy is the same as well you as an

658
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
individual go talk to people if you kind

659
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
of have a we never get anything from

660
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,840
this team here don't talk to them don't

661
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
understand what they do for a day job

662
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
how much workload they've got probably a

663
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,200
 ton of it and that's why it's

664
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,400
really hard to get anything from them

665
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
start to build a relationship

666
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,600
you're not always going to get success

667
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,120
but you're going to get better you're

668
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
just going to go ah

669
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,559
i wish someone would do something about

670
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,720
this or do something about it

671
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,799
don't talk to him build up a

672
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,760
relationship even in your own business

673
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,520
wow

[Music]

675
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,480
how many of you just to go off that how

676
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,799
many of you got kind of a a strategy in

677
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,240
any of your business areas not just

678
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
cyber how many of you got a strategy for

679
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,600
your team it might not be that you own

680
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,640
it i've got a strategy yeah how many of

681
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
you published your strategy for everyone

682
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,039
in the business to see

683
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
why not

684
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,720
it's really simple

685
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,080
someone might not read it but just put

686
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,000
it out there then anyone who happens to

687
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,559
be really really bored um and looks and

688
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
at least you know scrambling they might

689
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
be on the internet trying to find

690
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,039
something really useful like how do i

691
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,960
book holiday and you know six days later

692
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
when they still haven't found it they

693
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
might stumble onto you

694
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,760
what's this

695
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,720
tell them what you're doing tell them

696
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,039
why you're doing it telling your story

697
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,440
it'll engage with some people

698
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,039
put your profiles on there tell them

699
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,640
about yourselves

700
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
make it human make it reachable make it

701
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,120
transparent

702
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
why am i doing this thing which might be

703
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,080
an impediment to them living their life

704
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,440
in the workplace

705
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,559
i'm hopefully not going to be an

706
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,679
impediment that's the other side of

707
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,440
transparency i want to read but i want

708
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039
to tell them i don't want to just do it

709
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,039
to them i don't make them part of the

710
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,400
journey they might not be invested they

711
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,080
might not go oh wow they just published

712
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,159
a new cyber security strategy well god

713
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,679
the page won't load there's so many

714
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,480
people trying to get on the bugger

715
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,240
no generally speaking you know things

716
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
like security policies the only poor

717
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
bastard that reads them is the poor

718
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,880
bastard that wrote them

719
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,440
you know they're not riveting because

720
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
god knows to policies

721
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,080
thou shalt not without any risk but just

722
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
publish stuff get it out there not

723
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,120
everyone's going to read it

724
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,480
don't say oh we're going to do a blog

725
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,600
every week because that's really hard

726
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,320
because you've always got to have

727
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,600
content but things like strategy and

728
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
stuff like that publish it let people

729
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,960
read it let them understand that then

730
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,919
pretty good let them ask questions

731

732
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,240
foreign

733
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
i was light and then i was like

734
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,400
um

735
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
so we had a great conversation last

736
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
night yeah we talked about cross-site

737
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
scripting

738
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,600
and the difference between

739
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,120
everyone knows everyone knows everyone's

740
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,480
heard of cross-site scripting everyone

741
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,919
can talk about cross-site scripting how

742
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,760
many people actually understand what it

743
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,679
means in practice and it was kind of

744
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
going on it was going about the epiphany

745
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
moment of really understanding it

746
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,919
really understand it and then going now

747
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,840
i can apply that business context now i

748
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,919
can simplify it to someone else rather

749
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,440
just get cross-site scripting a bad

750
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,039
thing and you need to be far far far

751
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,799
yeah why what's going to happen oh yeah

752
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,480
well you know something bad might happen

753
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
yeah but what's the business impact

754
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,279
what's what's it mean to me i've got

755
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,559
seven features to deliver what's the

756
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,159
matter uh yeah but yeah but cross-site

757
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,480
scripting is bad it's like high and

758
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
no what's it actually mean to me because

759
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,480
i've got all this to do i had not

760
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
been able to actually

761
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,320
really tell people in the simple form

762
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,240
what does it mean and guess what they're

763
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
not always going to do what you want

764
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,600
guess what you're going to concede risk

765
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,080
all the time you are

766
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,720
all the time you accept risk now so one

767
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,080
of the best things is when you uncover a

768
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,159
risk everyone goes wow no we've got to

769
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,520
do something it was always there

770
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
you've by default accepted it for god

771
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,919
knows how many years all you've done is

772
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,360
uncover it that's actually a good thing

773
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,039
that's a step forward because now you

774
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,120
know well now you know some of it now

775
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,640
you can dig a bit deeper before you set

776
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,279
your hair on fire and go far no

777
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,720
it's a good thing now you're a step

778
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,080
further forward than you were yesterday

779
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,200
because that was there yesterday you

780
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
were just blissfully unaware now we need

781
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,400
to dive into it now we need to simplify

782
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
now we need to understand the business

783
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
context the effort involved to do

784
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,640
something about it

785
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,320
and then make decisions or help other

786
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,600
people make decisions and they're not

787
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
always going to be the decisions we want

788
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,039
them

789
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,760
is

790
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,120
the one that i would probably most

791
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,880
likely get into bed with is health and

792
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,480
safety

793
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,039
health and safety or near misses

794
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,440
why do they report near misses

795
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
because it can stop someone dying

796
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,360
how many of us report near misses

797
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,039
that's a giant show of hands here

798
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
everyone's really tired i know i can't

799
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,919
even get it

800
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,159
yeah

[Music]

803
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,320
i've spotted this it is a near miss

804
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
absolutely we need to just think of it

805
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,440
that way that's that's probably the

806
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,919
industry that of all of the ones that

807
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,200
i think i think health and safety is

808
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,399
what we should really think about and

809
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,279
how we approach some of this

810
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,049

[Music]

813
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
yeah it is a little bit of an easier

814
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,799
subject matter it's a little bit like

815
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,080
kind of there's a risk when you cross

816
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
the road

817
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,440
yeah it's quite tangible when you see a

818
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,760
big metal thing coming at you

819
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000
that's quite a tangible kind of threat

820
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
isn't it you're kind of like yes

821
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,760
but guess what people get killed on

822
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,840
roads every single day and we all know

823
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
that things heavy and that thing's going

824
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,600
to really do some damage but you know

825
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,039
that's i've accepted the risk if i

826
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,480
decide to run out between parked cars

827
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,520
i'm accepting the risk by default

828

[Music]

829
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,960
potentially

830
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,880
so it's a bit of a wishy-washy answer

831
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
mainly because we're crap at legislation

832
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,559
and we're even worse at implementation

833
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,159
and generally speaking people see it and

834
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,919
go cha-ching

835
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,240
make it rain what's that the gdpr make

836
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
it rain

837
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,840
hang on let's get a countdown clock on

838
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,919
this sorry

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,520
you know because then it's an

840
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,200
opportunity for someone to make i think

841
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,120
it is so long as we talk about it

842
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,279
practically at a practical level

843
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,399
um

844
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,480
just again simple steps forward thinking

845
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,760
about things like near misses thinking

846
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,880
about things like publishing your

847
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,679
strategy talking to other teams

848
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,760
one step forward

849
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
think about where do i want to get to

850
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,679
and what are the different blocks to get

851
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,279
me there and how many of them do i

852
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,880
control so therefore how many of them do

853
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,520
i need to improve relationships and apis

854
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,240
between teams

855
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,039
i think we're quite overwhelmed

856
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,709

857
