1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,640
hi everybody four thousand holes in

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,440
blackman lancashire um a lyric from the

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,599
beatles song a day in the life

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,960
song whose

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,679
lyrics were mostly taken from um stories

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,359
that john london was reading

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,080
in a newspaper and

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,800
it got me thinking um the

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,240
poor maintenance highways maintenance

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
chat from blackburn council that will

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,800
have had to deal with four thousand

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,519
holes probably had absolutely no clue

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,039
where to start with that it was an

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,200
enviably large task four thousand songs

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,399
like a lot of

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,680
potholes

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
and i realized it was very similar to

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,680
the job of your average vulnerability

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
manager out there it was a huge number

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
of vulnerabilities to fix

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,840
and no idea where to start them

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
this is going to be a very quick very

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
dull very boring talk on a very quick

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,760
very dull boring subject um

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,960
there will be a longer version of this

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,800
talk at some point

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
just a warning these slides are for

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,480
people that can actually pay attention

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,280
for

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,159
um to things there's no fancy graphics

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
there's no um clever memes or bad bad

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,520
jokes in the middle of them

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,479
it's very dull and boring

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,880
so um

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
let's start by talking about how most

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,320
vulnerability management programs start

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,119
really you come along somebody realizes

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,479
you need to do vulnerability management

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,479
in your organization so you go out you

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,960
buy quality messages and expose any you

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,680
know

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
probably it's kind of those lots out

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
there the big ones are all quite similar

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,799
um

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,960
and what you get back is you while you

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,400
fire it first at a huge number of

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
devices

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
you get an absolute pile of data back

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
you get a colossal number of

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
vulnerabilities right across your

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
organization that need fixing

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,320
and at this point one of two things

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,280
happen

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,439
either you become security policemen you

55
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,960
put your hat on you go on with your big

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
stick and you sort of moan the people

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
that own these systems and write this

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,960
software and tell them you know they

59
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
should they should be taking your um

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
your security seriously and they should

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,719
fix all the things you become

62
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
universally hated and you're seen as a

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,920
blocker that just stops people doing

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,199
real work

65
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,038
and a lot of organizations go down that

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,480
route and that's that's probably the

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
worst kind of vulnerability management

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
observation to be in where the entire

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,720
company hates you

70
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,800
um the other way of dealing with this

71
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,560
that a lot of companies take is that

72
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,319
they get their big report they put some

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
nice shiny headers on it they drop it on

74
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
a bosses table and they run like hell

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
um nobody wants to be the guy to

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
actually implement the fixes so it's

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,959
like i've done my bit i've told you

78
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,200
where all your vulnerabilities are let's

79
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
get out dodge before um

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
before somebody makes it my problem

81
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,959
but the third option of this really is

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
we start prioritizing we we look at our

83
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,599
big list of vulnerabilities and uh we

84
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,040
try and find a way of prioritizing the

85
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
important ones so how do we do that

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,879
well normally people's first attempt is

87
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,840
they look at their vulnerability

88
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,599
management scanning tool and realize it

89
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,879
has a thing in there to allow you to

90
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,840
assign

91
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
priorities and risks to you know to

92
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,519
subnets or to bits of your network or

93
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,760
things like that and people generally

94
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
start off using those but they realized

95
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,159
pretty quickly that the um their complex

96
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,599
network with a million different things

97
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,599
in other places doesn't really fit the

98
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,040
very simple

99
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
zones or categories or whatever the

100
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
software has

101
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,599
um

102
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,599
so other places they go for the quick

103
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
wins and they um they they realize it's

104
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,680
a numbers game they've got a big lot of

105
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
vulnerabilities so given the choice of

106
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
fixing one single cbs s10 or north rce

107
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,959
over here or 20 cvss twos down here for

108
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
some weak crypto that is you know you

109
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
need to be physically money in the

110
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,319
middle of the box to get hold of they're

111
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,680
going to go for the 20 because that

112
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,200
gives gets rid of 20 vulnerabilities

113
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,720
makes their numbers look a lot better

114
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,239
that gets rid of the one

115
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,080
doesn't make them look any better at all

116
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,159
really however in terms of actual

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
getting your company popped that rce is

118
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
the one that's going to get you pop not

119
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
the weak crypto down there

120
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,400
so that's not really an ideal way of

121
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
doing it either

122
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
and some just privatized by cbs escort

123
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,599
it's like okay we're going to take the

124
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
raw schools at these vulnerability

125
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,640
products

126
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
chuck out the back of it

127
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,200
and

128
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,560
we'll do the high numbers first and do

129
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,720
the low numbers last and whilst i'm

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,959
normally a big apologist for cvss cvss

131
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,480
is very much maligned and is actually

132
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
good for comparing

133
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,319
huge amounts of data so you know

134
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,238
disorder it to another audit or you know

135
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,079
this year's to last year's or things

136
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,320
like that it's dreadful for comparing

137
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
individual vulnerabilities

138
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
um it can be made a lot better by using

139
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
the environmental features of cvss there

140
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,919
is actually a scoring system in there so

141
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,040
that you can go and say for this

142
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,240
vulnerability

143
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
um there are these mythications in place

144
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,000
the the the the

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,240
um the environmental stuff in there

146
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,320
is quite usable but it puts you back in

147
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
the same position as the first problem

148
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,919
here if you spend your life not actually

149
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,080
finding vulnerabilities but of actually

150
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,560
feeding the vulnerability system data to

151
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
classify your vulnerabilities and that's

152
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,520
every bit as boring as finding them so

153
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
um

154
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
say so neither does i do we need to move

155
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,759
to some sort of risk-based system

156
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,680
so um what do we want to do for the

157
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,360
risk-based system

158
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
well we want to prioritize them based on

159
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,880
the risk of exploitation going back to

160
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
our real example we want people to focus

161
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
on that north rce who really is going to

162
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,039
get on an amount and not so much on the

163
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,280
on the low stuff this is you know it

164
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
there's a theoretical risk there but

165
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,639
there are so many other stars that need

166
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,450
to align it's not likely to happen

167
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,680
[Music]

168
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
the trouble to make risk decisions is

169
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
you need data to make those risk

170
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
decisions on and we've just highlighted

171
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,680
the problem that we're actually trying

172
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
to fix here is we've already got too

173
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
much front data with the vulnerability

174
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
data just going hey we've got a big pile

175
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,320
of data to fix this big pallet data what

176
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
we need is an even bigger pile of data

177
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,840
not a great place to be starting

178
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,039
from um

179
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,080
and even if you already have this data

180
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
in a lot of cases this data isn't all in

181
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
one place you may well have something

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
like a cmdb for those that don't know

183
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
configuration management database um is

184
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,960
what it stands for united steel terms in

185
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
a lot of other non-italy organizations

186
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,160
it's just a risk register but

187
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
essentially when i use cmdb what i

188
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,720
really mean is list of all your um your

189
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
hardware assets and all the data about

190
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
them seems to be actually much wider

191
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
scoping thing but that's what we mean in

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
this case

193
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,199
um as i said you may well have these but

194
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
in um

195
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,319
in in the old um xkcd cartoon goals you

196
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
know when um

197
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,000
if somebody realizes you have three

198
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
different policies for something what

199
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,199
they'll do is they'll look and go oh um

200
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,720
you know we should have argument those

201
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
are all into one policy and what you

202
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
don't end up with is one policy what you

203
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
actually get for policy exactly the same

204
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
as cmdb's if you've got several

205
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
different cmdbs or asset lists

206
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,280
containing bits different bits of

207
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,720
information about your hosts and your

208
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
notes and things like that

209
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
normally running out and um

210
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
and trying to build a new cmdb will just

211
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,759
get you another cmdb that's half-assed

212
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
and only does half a job so what this

213
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,360
talk because this talk is really about

214
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,919
is how to build that cmdb so that it

215
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,759
gets adopted and becomes your wonderful

216
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,440
sort of truth i also remember these are

217
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
grown-up slides

218
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
if you don't know the s-cat kcd cartoon

219
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,199
i'm looking for

220
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,039
go google it go find it yourself um

221
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,479
you're not going to get pretty pictures

222
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,000
in this talk

223
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,960
so um starting from cmdb one thing to

224
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
bear in mind you have something your

225
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,360
company probably needs you own a list

226
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
um of all the hosts on your network if

227
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,319
you're using the discovery right you've

228
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,919
got a full list of everything on your

229
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,759
network that is very valuable data to a

230
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,080
lot of organizations in the organization

231
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
a lot of places need to know what pcs

232
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,520
have we got

233
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
you've got that list that's a good

234
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,800
starting point

235
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
um

236
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
what you really need to do is find a

237
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
project and use that data and hijack it

238
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,599
now i i um i kind of hinted at this on

239
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,360
twitter the other day and so you can't

240
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,120
say that when people get the wrong idea

241
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,479
you've got that data you want to share

242
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,440
it you want to get it out there you

243
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
don't want to run you know hold it up

244
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
for a ransom for other people stuff so

245
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,319
we're going to hijack it we're going to

246
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,240
work together on a mutually beneficial

247
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,759
solution

248
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,160
um or hijack it if you have to but yeah

249
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,440
essentially we're going to buddy up with

250
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
somebody else that needs that data and

251
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
let them be the driving force behind

252
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,120
building your cmdb

253
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,919
um so our first cmtb project isn't

254
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
actually going to be cmdb it's going to

255
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,759
be something else that just happens to

256
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,280
be sat on top of our cmdb

257
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
so what sort of data do we want to put

258
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
in there we'll say we've got our list of

259
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,440
hosts and our list of vulnerabilities

260
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
what else do we need in there to go to

261
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
make risk decisions around that data

262
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
um

263
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,160
so first of all we don't want to

264
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,800
reinvent the um

265
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
the wheel we don't want to be the owner

266
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
of all this data we want to try and grab

267
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,759
other people's data and get it into or

268
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,680
close to our cmdb so we can use it we

269
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,039
don't want to actually start owning a

270
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,479
lot of this data

271
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,919
but we can reach out to lots of other

272
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
teams to see how their data stored and

273
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,440
see if it would be better stored in cmdb

274
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
you'll be amazed how much your

275
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,200
organization works on big lists in excel

276
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
where once a year they may come along

277
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,399
pulling your list of posts and compare

278
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,240
it to you know what they paid for or

279
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,080
what the network teams think they've got

280
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
or what the licensing team things

281
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
they've got

282
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,399
the trick is to reach out to those teams

283
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,680
and say hey we've actually got all this

284
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,080
data over here in this lovely cm in this

285
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
lovely tmdb that we've built why don't

286
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
you take your data and put it in the

287
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,839
same place and then we can use the same

288
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,200
reporting layer the same management

289
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
tools have the same people look after it

290
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
and try and get them to work with you to

291
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,800
put their stuff

292
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,399
and they've currently got holding little

293
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,000
spreadsheets together they'll probably

294
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,839
get a much better thing out uh result

295
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,600
out of it they'll probably get bits of

296
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
people to own the process maybe own the

297
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
database it runs on or own the

298
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,480
management layer

299
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,200
and generally your cmdb starts to grow

300
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
into time over an actual useful thing

301
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
that everybody

302
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
um bolts on top of

303
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,080
um and point out to them that you know

304
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
at the moment they're taking your data

305
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,240
say annually they can have it in real

306
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
time you if you're running a management

307
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
software is updating your list of hosts

308
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,120
all the time so could there so that

309
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,959
their gdpr map or whatever they're doing

310
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,640
also has this data

311
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
going in there live

312
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
and you know so you know you can

313
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,240
basically

314
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
you're helping them to make their thing

315
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,440
better by building on top of your thing

316
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
um so what sort of data do we want in

317
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
there um things like network types

318
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,000
network segments that sort of thing if

319
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,880
you do do well segmented networks

320
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,839
um

321
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,200
then you know make that a factor the

322
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,399
idea was here what was what was

323
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,640
basically our starting point is

324
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,839
um a host contain a host on our public

325
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,480
perimeter containing very private data

326
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
is the highest risk on top of that we're

327
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,320
adding mitigations we're adding things

328
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
that lower the risk so networks that

329
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,519
went if it's on a network segment that

330
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
you can only get to if you've um

331
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,640
if you're in a special group of users

332
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,399
and use 2fa

333
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,079
that's the mitigation we can add that

334
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,959
into our um into our list

335
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,480
um host type um you know sort of

336
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,040
a a vending machine may be a whole yeah

337
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
there's a whole different risk to a an

338
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,519
access control system so build that into

339
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,959
there reach out to people like your

340
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,320
compliance team they have loads of

341
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,680
information about the data that you've

342
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,279
got on service and how it and how

343
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,640
important is the company and how much

344
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,079
risk there is to the company so things

345
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
like pci it's like you know if if it's

346
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,399
um within the cardholder data

347
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,480
environment um you know with the

348
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
the cde that's a very high risk if it's

349
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
not it's less of a risk same with gdpr

350
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
if it's got pii on it it's quite a high

351
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
risk if it hasn't then it's quite a low

352
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
risk reach out to all these teams get

353
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
their data back put it with your data so

354
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,160
you can use their data to help drive

355
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,079
your prioritization

356
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,800
um similarly the actual financial value

357
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,680
um is is is a relevance big important

358
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,079
service system high risk little desktop

359
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,480
probably not so much risk um some odd

360
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,760
ones that we've used that have worked

361
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
quite well that data recovery priority

362
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,399
if something's got a 15-minute sla in a

363
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,760
dr situation that's probably quite

364
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,959
important to the company probably care

365
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,480
about that a lot made that patch if

366
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,440
we've got something that's got a

367
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,079
three-week sla that's holding the the

368
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,680
lunch ordering system

369
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
probably not going to be top of our

370
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
patching list either

371
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,320
change status was another one that we

372
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
tied into um you know if something needs

373
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
you know that an engineer can just go

374
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
and change without approval that's quite

375
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,160
a low resistance probably not

376
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
particularly one that is top-of-the-line

377
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,440
to care about if it's one that needs

378
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
three layers of quite senior approval

379
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,959
again that's probably a high risk high

380
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,480
value system so you can build that into

381
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
it things like slas or wildlife there's

382
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,839
all sorts of things we can put into it

383
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,440
um and i say it's all about mitigation

384
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,639
so you know if you've got a list of

385
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,839
things that are behind the waffle things

386
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,440
that aren't the things behind the waff

387
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,279
naturally lower that risk therefore we

388
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,320
can give a little bit of time on the

389
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
patching

390
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,639
um and literally anything that helps us

391
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
decide the the importance and of the

392
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,639
relevance of the data on there

393
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,480
and the longer version of this talk i

394
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
talk a lot about set architecture and

395
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,519
how it can save you everything sec

396
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,800
architecture do

397
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,720
is a mitigation everything that this

398
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,399
your prioritization should be doing is

399
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
taking into a into account any

400
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,360
mitigations and giving people um longer

401
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
patching sla based on

402
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,959
the number of mitigation they so go talk

403
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,000
to your architects talk about what

404
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,519
they've done try and codify that try and

405
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,360
build that into your

406
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
calculations as well so the end result

407
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
what have we got we've got we we no

408
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,279
longer have a patch all the things

409
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,200
attitude we've got a perhaps the most

410
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
important things first attitude which is

411
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,320
great because you can actually say to

412
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,680
people well we don't ever you know

413
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,200
patching isn't a zero-sum game we don't

414
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
expect to patch everything we just want

415
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,000
the important stuff and this is the

416
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
important stuff

417
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,079
the um the sla between what's important

418
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,519
how long it can be fixed that can be a

419
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,720
moving line depending on the

420
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
capabilities make it easy at first say

421
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,639
okay anything that's a 10 we're going to

422
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,880
give you seven days to fix anything you

423
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
know and then in this case actually tens

424
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
are really important so we're going to

425
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
fix those under incident conditions and

426
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
same same way anyhow anything that's um

427
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,800
that's a high we're going to give you um

428
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
you know a month and then come down to

429
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,240
you know say okay can you do this within

430
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,839
10 days okay let's move outside that one

431
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,760
anything because you've got the math say

432
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,000
it gets really flexible to where to put

433
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,279
that line

434
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,959
um it also cuts down a lot on arguments

435
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,880
and the only real argument is whether or

436
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
not all the mitigations that they're

437
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,600
saying is the reason that they shouldn't

438
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
be bothered patching

439
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,240
does the math take that into

440
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,399
consideration uh you know if they're

441
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,600
saying well you know nobody can ever get

442
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,560
to that machine instead well we'll take

443
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,199
that into account no um you know the

444
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
that um

445
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
that machine is is is um you know

446
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,560
there's no data on that machine so why

447
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,079
do we care that same consideration so it

448
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,120
actually clips out a lot of the

449
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,560
arguments about why people shouldn't

450
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,639
shouldn't patch

451
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,399
um so some final tips to help it to land

452
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,160
um metrics reporting again a longer

453
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,519
version i talk a lot about reporting

454
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
about reporting is really important but

455
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,959
reporting is a narrative you're trying

456
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,199
to send across a message that message

457
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,320
should be

458
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,079
how well improvements are going it's not

459
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,480
about how bad your infra team and your

460
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
ops team and your your your devs are

461
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,839
about um

462
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,639
patching it's all about um you know how

463
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
they're improving so control that

464
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,199
narrative

465
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,120
um highlight the good behavior don't

466
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
necessarily highlight the bad too much

467
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
um big numbers are scary t-shirt sizes

468
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,279
are great so you know

469
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,240
very much aim for um a

470
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,120
critical high moderate low rather than

471
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
you know a 6.3 versus a 4.4

472
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
and percentage changes are great if the

473
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,240
thing you're trying to show is that

474
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,600
everybody is improving this and getting

475
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,880
better so a ten percent sound

476
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
change sounds a lot better than

477
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,839
something going from a thousand to nine

478
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,360
hundred so lots of percentage change

479
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
numbers in there

480
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,959
um

481
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,120
oh my slides have stopped working

482
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
focus only on what's attainable if

483
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,160
you're only expecting people at the

484
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
moment to focus on criticals and highs

485
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,320
don't bother reporting on the moderates

486
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
and lows or you know bury that deep in

487
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
the report so nobody really cares about

488
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,279
it you're trying to change behavior with

489
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,800
this and if you think that this behavior

490
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,880
you're not going to change in the moment

491
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,639
don't bother actually reporting on it

492
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
again this when people see that huge

493
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,079
pile of vulnerabilities it looks bad if

494
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,240
you can say hey we we've we've cut out

495
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,639
80 percent of our um our criticals and

496
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,519
highs

497
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
that's a good message to get across

498
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
um help people understand that risk

499
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,079
owning is their job too many places it's

500
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
like oh well we this this machine is

501
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,759
hard to patch so we've asked security

502
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,839
for an exception it's like that's not an

503
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,680
acceptable thing the risk is there

504
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,560
security can advise on risk um

505
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
explain to them that you know this is

506
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,519
their risk it's their choice whether

507
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,199
they patch it it's up to their

508
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,720
up to them or not

509
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,040
um and this this report is to help them

510
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
understand that risk

511
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,040
and one of the things that we do bullet

512
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,240
works really well is letting them set

513
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,639
their own slas we sort of jokingly said

514
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,800
it's like okay you um moderate

515
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,079
vulnerability you can have a year to fix

516
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,360
that and they all sort of scuffed as if

517
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
to say you know what that's stupid you

518
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,399
know why would a vulnerability open for

519
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,320
a year it's like okay that's

520
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
that is stupid we agree but what what's

521
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
acceptable what do you think is a

522
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
sensible time scale to fix this in and

523
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
then once you've got that in place you

524
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,959
measure and say okay well we're hitting

525
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
that quite easily can we get it faster

526
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,560
do you need more automation if we're

527
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,959
missing it let them you know

528
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
there's no point in um

529
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,279
creating a target that can never hit

530
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,320
um and another one again i just like um

531
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,680
reporting in general another going to be

532
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
a lot more in the longer version of this

533
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,880
is

534
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,000
people have someone back saying oh we

535
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,199
can't afford the downtime to take that

536
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,399
you know that box makes the money we

537
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,839
can't afford downtime just to patch it

538
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,600
for something really important

539
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,839
the argument against that is that at the

540
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,199
moment you had a vulnerability

541
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,040
management problem you've now got from

542
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,720
problems and an availability problem

543
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,320
what happens if that box goes down for

544
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,480
something unplanned

545
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
get them to fix the availability problem

546
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
if the problem is you can't patch it

547
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
because it can't go down the problem is

548
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,600
that it can't go down not that it can't

549
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,079
be patched that's just a symptom

550
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,039
uh and some bonus slides for um red

551
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,160
teams at the end just because i said in

552
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,280
the abstract to include something for

553
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,679
red teamers if you can get hold of the

554
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,679
cmdb data if you can get all of the

555
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,480
reports around it they it points to a

556
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,280
lot of the um the dead bodies so things

557
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,599
to look out for in that data

558
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,799
look for things that are flagged as out

559
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,319
of scope these are the dark colors these

560
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,880
are a bit that nobody really wants to be

561
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
bothered at looking after and if no if

562
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,320
the people that are trying to drive

563
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
under management aren't looking after it

564
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,559
there will be bad stuff in them

565
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,760
um

566
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
legacy stuff stuff that's that's old

567
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
stuff that is is clusters too hard to

568
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
patch because it's ancient again if it's

569
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
not if it's old and start getting

570
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
patched it's vulnerable generally look

571
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,840
for stuff that's risk accepted as i

572
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
mentioned before i despise risk

573
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,080
acceptance as a as a concept the risk is

574
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,679
always that you can't accept a risk it

575
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
just mean you you just have decided

576
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,000
there are other factors that mean that

577
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,919
you can't meet in sla but anything's

578
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,520
risk accepted again there's a reason

579
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
that's not getting patched go and dig

580
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
into it because you know it it's

581
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,799
definitely bad um one of my favorites

582
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,160
the unknown and unloved in any

583
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
organization stuff gets built that

584
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
nobody ever like you know the team that

585
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,120
built it got disbanded and sent six ways

586
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,559
to win which means that nobody's looking

587
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,240
after it nobody's patching it if you've

588
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,520
got cmdb that implies ownership

589
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
go and find out the stuff with no owner

590
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,080
because that's the stuff that isn't

591
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,960
getting looked after

592
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
and that ladies and gentlemen at just

593
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
under 20 minutes is my guided tour of um

594
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,360
of of how to win at building a cmdb to

595
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,720
actually do vulnerability management

596
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,919
properly

597
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,320
um if any of you have any questions

598
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,440
you've got literally 30 seconds

599
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,400
um come and find me online um
