1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,560
good morning everyone my name is emily

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,800
moragori

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,880
i'm going to be taking you through how

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,599
to sell cybersecurity to the board

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,920
i hope you've had a good start to the

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,800
conference and you've had informative

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
sessions during the morning sessions or

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,199
the talks that came at least before this

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,080
one

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
so like i've mentioned today i'm going

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,680
to be taking you through

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,800
how to sell cyber security to the board

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
a little bit about myself

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
my name is emily moragueri like i've

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,160
said

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
i'm an information security professional

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,719
with experience in web mobile and

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,399
network security

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,039
penetration testing user awareness and

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,680
it audit currently i work with a local

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
bank in nairobi kenya

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,719
so that's what i do as my day job in

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
addition to that i like

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,559
teaching robotics to children so during

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,000
the weekends or at least when i'm free

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,199
i also teach robotics to children using

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,840
the first lego league and i'm also

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
a judge in the same competition

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
so without any further ado i think let's

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,840
get into the topic of the day

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,680
because we have a lot to cover and

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
unpack during the session

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,080
so what we will do during the session

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,040
we'll have an introduction to the topic

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,880
we'll do a case study to help us

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,720
understand more on the pointers that we

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,759
are going to learn during the session

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,240
and lastly we are going to conclude the

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,720
session

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
so an introduction we are going to look

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
at what is a board and what is its key

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,479
role

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,119
in the information security sector of

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,399
any organization or any business

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
so what is the boat the boat sits on top

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
of an organization and it's responsible

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
for knowing and over saying everything

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,520
in the company

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,840
the board knows the operation the ins

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
and outs of any company

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,479
and how the company operates and the key

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,719
risks that are threatening the overall

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,479
success of a company

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
so the board is responsible

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,080
for overseeing the overall success of a

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,400
company and also

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,319
identifying the key threats to any

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,599
company

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,720
a major risk in any organization

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
so at the moment right now

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
is the cyber security risk be it a bank

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
be it a hospital

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
be it a school because of the data that

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,080
they carry

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
poses

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
or

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,959
is is threatened by the center security

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,000
risk

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
so like any other strategy in an

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
organization cyber security should take

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,879
a top-down approach what do i mean by

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,599
that the strategy of an organization or

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,599
a business should be driven by the board

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,920
of directors they're the ones who give

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,879
the directive on the direction that the

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,120
company should take like any other

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,720
strategy

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
the cyber security

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
strategy should be driven by the board

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,239
such that

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
it should have a top-down approach it

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,159
should be driven by the board and the

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
top-level management it cannot come from

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,319
a junior employee and go up it should

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,040
come from the board and be trickled down

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
to

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,239
medium level manager

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,400
and the junior employees and so on and

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,959
so forth

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720
so a case study

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,920
xyz hospital has been in operation for

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
two years now and has a fully fledged

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,599
corporate network the hospital also has

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,519
an open wi-fi that gets used while

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,159
visiting the hospital there is no way

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,560
yet to separate the corporate network

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
that is the servers the databases that

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
carry the

99
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
customer or client information from what

100
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
the guests can access from their wi-fi

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
having identified the risk the cisco

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,799
requires board approval to acquire a

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,519
network access system to

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
to segregate the two networks that's the

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,239
corporate network in which that carries

106
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,879
the servers the databases the data of

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,319
the organization and the

108
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,879
wi-fi that the customers or the clients

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,519
that come to the hospital use maybe to

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,478
browse the network or download documents

111
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,280
so how should this is to go about it

112
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,160
so this is what we will use

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
to analyze and bring out the the concept

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
of how to sell cyber security to the

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,960
board so i'm just going to allow like 30

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
seconds for you to read through

117
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,479
the case study and internalize it

118
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,120
so maybe i can go through it again xyz

119
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,680
hospital has been in operation for two

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
years now and has a fully fledged

121
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,160
corporate network the hospital has an

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,960
open wi-fi that gets used while visiting

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,520
the hospital there is no way yet to

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,720
separate the corporate network and the

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,199
network in which the the customers or

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
the clients use to access the network

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
the the internet sorry while visiting

128
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,800
the hospital

129
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,199
the ciso has identified this as a key

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
risk i'm sure why we i'm sure we all

131
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
know why this is a key risk if public if

132
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,120
the wi-fi that the customers used to

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,639
access the

134
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
internet can also be used to access

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
internal resources

136
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,880
so the ciso has identified this risk and

137
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
requires board approval

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,000
to acquire a network access control tool

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
to segregate the true networks so how

140
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
should they go about it

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
so a few pointers that you will cover

142
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,240
the first thing is empathy and emotional

143
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
connection

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,400
do not ever underestimate

145
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,199
the

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,520
power of these two the second thing is

147
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,280
cyber risk and not cyber security and

148
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,199
risk calculus the other thing is

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,520
permission to decide the other thing is

150
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,000
context scheme always a business

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
perspective you should always give

152
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
context to

153
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
thing that you cover the other thing is

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
lead and teach the other thing is a

155
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
framework the other way thing is

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
business objectives so these are the

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
things that we are going to cover during

158
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,440
the session

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,240
so on to my first point of empathy and

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
emotional connection the first thing is

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,840
it is easy it's very easy to lose human

162
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,000
connection we are talking about malware

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,600
risk ram somewhere and network security

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,840
when you get into the technical dragons

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
it's very

166
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
easy for you to forget that you're

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,000
actually talking to humans and that they

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
actually connect you should actually

169
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
connect on a human to human level with

170
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
them you should make a human connection

171
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,479
and take the customer's perspective our

172
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,639
audience does not care about maps or

173
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
chats or cyber security statistics you

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
should always keep in mind that you're

175
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
talking to the topmost

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,479
management level of an organization all

177
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,479
they want to know is

178
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,360
what is the impact of my of the cyber

179
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,400
security risk to my organization they do

180
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
not care about they care about the risk

181
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
and the impact associated if the risk is

182
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,080
actually actualized by concentrating

183
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
only on the data metric graphs you see

184
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,080
all this presentation that we usually

185
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,479
carry when we are presenting our cases

186
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,800
to the board you will miss the

187
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,440
unconscious and very human element of

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,919
decision making process that is the

189
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,280
feelings

190
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,199
your audience is only interested in how

191
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,280
you will make their world a better place

192
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,840
for them to live in that is if the board

193
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
is only interested in making the

194
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
organization

195
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
a profitable organization or a

196
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
successful one and if you put across the

197
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,360
point that for instance if customer data

198
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,479
is accessed from the public wi-fi

199
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,840
it might lead to financial penalties

200
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,160
the more the board is more often than

201
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
not

202
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
likely to pay attention to you when you

203
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,960
capture that aspect of the presentation

204
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
and your audience only speaks finance

205
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,440
with an emphasis of profit and loss risk

206
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,759
and reward

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,840
as a result your story needs to be

208
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,080
relatable to the audience that is driven

209
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,639
by either fear game or

210
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,000
uses actual risk expressed in monetary

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
terms especially to communicate the

212
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,159
future state of the world if they choose

213
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,360
for instance

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,159
not to acquire their

215
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
network

216
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,080
network access control system and if

217
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,320
they choose to actually acquire it you

218
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,240
cannot reach the audience with data that

219
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
expresses leaks in terms of low high

220
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
medium you have to actually connect with

221
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
them on a personal level and tell them

222
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,320
if for instance if we do not have a

223
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
network access access control system

224
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,480
our

225
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
client data might be reached

226
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,000
and we might be subject to penalties as

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
we have infringed some of the

228
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,560
laws like for instance their gdpr law

229
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,120
the other thing is personal

230
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,000
brand personality in marketing

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
opinions are important because they

232
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,080
convey a sense of urgency about your

233
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
story without an opinion there's no

234
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,279
passions

235
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,360
opinions challenger prospects to think

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
you want them to think about why you are

237
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,839
selling them and not why you're selling

238
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,720
them this idea and not that so you need

239
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
to give a back story of how

240
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
of why we need to

241
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,839
like

242
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,240
of why we need to acquire the network

243
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
access control system instead of giving

244
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,760
instead of getting the board to sign of

245
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,800
an additional spend because it will do

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,399
this and that will prevent future

247
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,279
malware attacks get them to sign off an

248
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,760
investment in the future of the company

249
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,279
an investment that will increase the

250
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,519
company's brand credibility

251
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
through customer safety and lead to

252
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,160
increased revenue customer loyalty and

253
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
profit so the

254
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,800
board

255
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
i'm sorry to say this but more often

256
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,519
than not it cares about

257
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,680
how much money i'm making how is my

258
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,640
company looking from the outside view

259
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,200
how are my customers viewing me so while

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
presenting the case you should always

261
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,839
make sure that you also

262
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,440
give an a connection to all those things

263
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
if my customer for instance if customer

264
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
information is

265
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
breached

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
of course that will have a very adverse

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,160
effect on the said company

268
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,399
and so there is need to

269
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,640
acquire that network access control

270
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,519
system so when you put across that

271
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,760
point in that manner instead of just

272
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
giving the technical dragons to the

273
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
board of directors you're more often

274
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
than not to cut across the message to

275
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,680
them so you are the cso and thus credent

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,920
credentials which establish in

277
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
from your authority but authority by

278
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
itself is not enough refocusing the

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
conversation on the fiduciary outcome

280
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,920
instead of threat vectors and

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
vulnerability landscape will improve

282
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
your credibility as well so i i think i

283
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
hope we are together on that

284
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
so your brand personality needs to

285
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,079
insist through your actions

286
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,560
communications demeanor that you are all

287
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,200
about the risk in the organization and

288
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
that

289
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,959
till

290
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,480
your blaze

291
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
is designed to accommodate their needs

292
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
and not yours so you should always have

293
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,959
the interest of the company at hand

294
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,640
don't be just don't just be throwing

295
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
technical dragons around

296
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
have the strategy of the business in

297
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,959
mind also as the strategy of the

298
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,959
business is what will drive the cyber

299
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,120
security strategy of any organization

300
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
the other thing is cyber risk not cyber

301
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
security and also you should calculate

302
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
the risk calculus

303
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
so when presenting your case to the

304
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,120
board

305
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,079
you should always have cyber risk in

306
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,800
mind not cyber security i know i know

307
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,279
it's very tempting especially as from

308
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,079
the tech side it's very tempting for you

309
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,279
to put up to put across the point

310
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
using very many

311
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
technical things that the board might

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,279
not understand have this in mind that

313
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,800
the board is the

314
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
driver or overseer of the business

315
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
strategy so the audience is used to

316
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
making risk decision based on financial

317
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,279
impact of the business like now for

318
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,480
instance if you tell them

319
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,079
if we are exposed as a company and we

320
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:42,880
in

321
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,240
in one way or another

322
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,959
our customer data is

323
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,839
accessed by a customer for instance and

324
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,160
they're not supposed to access that data

325
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,399
we might be fine let's say

326
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,720
10 million dollars you see if you put

327
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
across that point in that way now the

328
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,079
board will say huh

329
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,560
it this thing is actually worth

330
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
investing into as it's a risk to my

331
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,760
company as it might decrease my profit

332
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
it might have a detrimental value to my

333
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,079
company brand so your audience does not

334
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,079
know what to do with this position that

335
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,079
begins with the 30s this is

336
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,720
characterized by low medium and high

337
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,959
time to probability events but the

338
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,040
audience does know what to do with a

339
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200
case study that involves an incident

340
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,079
that occur due to not taking appropriate

341
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,639
measures on a similar issue so while

342
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,839
doing your research you should also

343
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,279
have a case study of a similar event

344
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,800
that occurred

345
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,440
and the repercussions that it took there

346
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,360
are so many events that have occurred

347
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
recently and in the past

348
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,240
of cyber security breaches and the

349
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,880
impact that it had to organizations or

350
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,440
businesses so it would be wise if you

351
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
came across if you came with such a case

352
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,279
study to present to the board

353
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,320
so

354
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,000
the other thing issued you should give

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,920
the board the permission to decide so

356
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,320
once you've presented the case you've

357
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
come up with a case study that and that

358
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,279
has the financial implications that

359
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,519
has been hard you should give the board

360
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,519
the permission to decide so the story

361
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,360
that you've given them uses terms that

362
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,199
the board and the c-level buyers can

363
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,760
understand and relate to from the case

364
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
study that you have pre presented they

365
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
will be able to see the value in

366
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,120
actually investing in the system or in

367
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
the software that you want

368
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
to

369
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
to acquire so in addition to this in

370
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,920
addition the story will also strike to

371
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,560
important emotional drivers that is one

372
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,360
fear and safety so when we present when

373
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,279
you present the case

374
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
and

375
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,880
the board will see the need as they can

376
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
see that this is something that has

377
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,519
actually happened and these are the

378
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,760
consequences of what

379
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
happened when

380
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,160
for instance this network access control

381
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,440
tool was not

382
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,320
bought and customer data was able to be

383
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
accessed from an external party

384
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,519
the other thing is always have contests

385
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,480
give the the board context and always a

386
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,440
business

387
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,920
perspective when you're thinking about

388
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
your story keep in mind your audience

389
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,959
content deriving a technical

390
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,440
delivering a technical view of cyber

391
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,199
risk will completely confuse the

392
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,519
business centric board so you should

393
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,399
always have a business

394
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
you should always wear your business hat

395
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,959
while presenting the case to your board

396
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,320
you should start your pitch by

397
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,000
introducing risk from the business

398
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,040
perspective eg we hold very confidential

399
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,839
medical records and unauthorized access

400
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,639
of them could have financial implication

401
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,199
it is critical that we separate the two

402
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,199
networks immediately so when you start

403
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,959
with that

404
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,839
rationale it's more likely than not the

405
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,600
body is more

406
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,959
is more

407
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,880
likely to

408
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,680
listen to you as they can see

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,639
they can contextualize the risk that is

410
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,279
at hand and they can contextualize

411
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,439
their

412
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,040
they can contextualize the impact that

413
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,279
will occur if the risk is actually

414
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,199
actualized

415
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
so the other thing that cesar should do

416
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,639
while presenting

417
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,199
cyber security to the board is to teach

418
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,320
and to lead remember you're the

419
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
you're the technical quote-unquote

420
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,920
person here you're the person who's

421
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,040
tasked with providing direction on might

422
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,079
as cyber security in any organization or

423
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,560
business so as they see so your job is

424
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,480
to get the board to recognize and

425
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,880
acknowledge the realities of today's

426
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,399
threat landscape

427
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,399
so they need to understand they need to

428
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,720
have to have they need to separate the

429
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,560
two networks so you should explain to

430
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
them and they need to separate what is

431
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,440
accessible from the internal network and

432
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
what is accessible from what we are

433
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,079
giving our customers so teaching your

434
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,679
board about these threats and the

435
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,480
associated risk provides them useful

436
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,240
insight to better govern the

437
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,359
organization and further

438
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,679
publishes your credentials as a

439
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,400
proactive and helpful member of the team

440
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,640
so don't you ever forget that the work

441
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
of the cso is to provide direction on

442
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,400
matter cyber security so you should

443
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,200
always give the board an understanding

444
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
of why you want for instance to acquire

445
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,679
a network access control too you know

446
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,640
that is a cost and more often than not

447
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,120
the cyber security team is always looked

448
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,120
at as a cost center so you should always

449
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,160
aim to teach the board on why you

450
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
require

451
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,600
a certain tool or a certain

452
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
software

453
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,200
so the other thing is to have a

454
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
framework in which

455
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,360
you are basing your case on so most

456
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,840
systems are comfortable with frameworks

457
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
which is good because we are suggesting

458
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
one

459
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
that will work effectively for your

460
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,640
board communication so if your

461
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,039
presentations are framed within a model

462
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,679
of cyber risk that is familiar to your

463
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,480
board they will have a major much better

464
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,919
chance of being hard this bot this model

465
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,400
structures for attributes of cyber risk

466
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,720
which an attacker is at its core so what

467
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,919
is the probability that someone using

468
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,400
the public wi-fi that we have provided

469
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
for them will be able to

470
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,480
access the customer's records so success

471
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,960
susceptibility what is susceptibility to

472
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,080
that risk are we susceptible to that

473
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
risk

474
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,840
severity what what is the impact if the

475
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,559
risk actually occurs in urgency how

476
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,039
fast do we need to actually actualize

477
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
this network access control tool so

478
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,440
while presenting your case to the board

479
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,760
you should keep in mind this for upset

480
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,840
aspects the probability that it will

481
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,720
actually occur how susceptible are we to

482
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
this actual risk and how severe will it

483
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,720
be if this risk is actually actualized

484
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,000
and how urgent is it for us to incur the

485
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,360
cost to

486
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
for instance like in our case study

487
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,360
acquire the network access control tool

488
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,960
the other thing is always have the

489
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,440
business objectives in my list this

490
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,919
debate we always have should the

491
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,120
business

492
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,039
strategy drive the cyber security

493
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,360
strategy or should the cyber security

494
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,760
strategy drive the business strategy

495
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
from my own assessment i think we should

496
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,120
all look at the business strategy and it

497
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,240
should what should drive and it is what

498
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,360
should drive the cyber security strategy

499
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,320
so technology may be

500
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,039
where a cyber threat begins and how it

501
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,880
will be mitigated but the business

502
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,520
impact is what matters so at the end of

503
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
the day as much we are as much as we are

504
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,159
technical past people

505
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,480
the business strategy should what should

506
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
be what that should be guiding us so if

507
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,240
for instance we want to be

508
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,640
pci dss compliant

509
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,799
and we still have this risk in our

510
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,280
environment there is no way

511
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,000
that this business objective can be met

512
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,720
so while presenting the case to the

513
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,600
board you should also have in mind the

514
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,080
business objective and the business

515
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,840
strategy so where is the business

516
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,200
heading is acquisition of this tool

517
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,360
going to

518
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,919
also drive the business strategy so as

519
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,760
you address each audience you might

520
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,159
tailor your story to integrate their

521
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,840
business objectives so if you're talking

522
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,679
to the board for instance you should

523
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
always have what what are the board

524
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,600
expecting from the business if you're

525
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,159
talking to management about the what

526
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,000
you're trying to acquire you should

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,080
always have the objectives of the

528
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,559
management for the business

529
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,559
in mind when presenting your case

530
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,360
the other thing is the conclusion so

531
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,000
moving away from your procession is just

532
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
as just a call center who is constantly

533
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
getting in the way of progress is

534
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
actually easier than it sounds so more

535
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,039
often than not in many organizations you

536
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,840
will find that cyber security teams are

537
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,400
always viewed as cost centers or no

538
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,039
departments so we should always strive

539
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,440
to move away from that perception in any

540
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,919
business so it starts with your ability

541
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,760
to begin framing cyber security

542
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
challenges in a cyber risk context in

543
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,120
line with business objectives so when

544
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
you are able to measurably impact the

545
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,559
business through helping your

546
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,360
organization define its risk appetite

547
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,760
and by identifying alternate path to

548
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,960
mitigators in a language and models that

549
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,200
are understandable to your board in the

550
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,919
entire season you will finally be seen

551
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,320
as a certified and participating peer

552
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,799
member of the executive tribe so

553
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,200
it's i think it's high time that

554
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,159
we

555
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,400
people or organizations

556
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
turn around the notion that they have

557
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,559
that cyber security teams are always

558
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,919
call centers and they are always

559
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,640
derailing the business or strategy or

560
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,360
the business objectives so when you when

561
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,039
you put across your point as mitigating

562
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,600
the risks that occur in the business and

563
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,840
also driving the business strategy i

564
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,159
think we will turn around and we will

565
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,640
have an effective way of communicating

566
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
cyber security to the board

567
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,080
so thank you for your time

568
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
