13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,879
masks

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,000
but can we all sanitize social existence

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,440
as best you can

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,440
you sold half the capacity that this can

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,399
hold

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,840
in the hope that there's enough room for

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,960
everyone

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,730

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,080
there are no excuses and we will beat

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
you into anything

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,920
against it

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,360

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
45 vinyl which is your b-side rifle

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,360

please we have checked them

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
there was a couple that were borderline

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
offensive by what you mean there's like

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
i was gonna say it now there was like

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,040
rolf harris was in there for example so

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,439
if that's the case please feel free

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,520
to swap and shop and change i'm the john

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,759
lennon glasses obviously because you

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,200
might have noticed there's a bit of a

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
beatles theme in this particular part of

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,079
liverpool

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,200
and

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,240
i want to say we run this thing on a

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,479
bootstrap right we run it really tight

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,040
you don't want to make extra money and

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,840
we just want it to go into the event so

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
on that score you have

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,159
half of until they don't know this

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,560
morning

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,119
constantly it's constant

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,080
and

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
yeah coffee's until they've run out this

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
morning there's coffees again this

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,040
afternoon until they run out because our

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
code is another thing there's less

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
reviews on the tickets you sold so we

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
should be absolutely golden for coffee

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
constantly

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280
um there are there are lunches including

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
veggie vegan eye options

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
and a paper bag lunch so you'll get that

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
and if you want to say after

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120

your title

106
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720

money and hashtags and banners are great

114
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
but they need cash so that's what we're

115
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,120
