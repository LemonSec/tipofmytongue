00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,319
hi

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,600
i'm simon

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,559
welcome to besides liverpool

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,800
the views expressed in this talk are not

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,880
the views of my current employer or

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
previous employers

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
what they are are a sort of series of

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,359
things that i've learned in a

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,279
fairly long idea career and things that

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,039
people have shared with me generously

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,400
and and i'm now sort of passing that on

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,160
and what we're talking about really is

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
is how to get security implemented how

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,040
to be effective how to get stuff done

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,160
um

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,800
so let's begin

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,640
just a bit of context

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
and this is applicable really everywhere

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,520
yeah

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,640
even at home

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
uh i've got a big list of jobs that i

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,039
should be doing when i'm doing other

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,160
things

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
um but in a work environment you know

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
this this is really true

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,360
um

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
yeah when i was doing data warehousing

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,039
when i was doing building ecommerce

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,879
systems we had more stuff that we needed

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,440
to deliver we never had the time or all

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,040
the people we wanted

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
and and budgets were tight

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
and from security this is really

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
important to sort of understand because

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
it actually applies to security projects

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,680
but more importantly for a lot of

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
projects what we require is other people

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
to implement the controls we want or to

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,360
build the solutions we want or to change

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
the way they works so that we've got the

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,040
correct security

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
so to get that we need security agreed

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
and we need to agree that it's important

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
we need to have it prioritized and we

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
need to get it implemented because if

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,360
you've got controls aren't implemented

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,000
they're not really controls

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
so

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,000
yeah

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,079
who makes those decisions how do we get

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,479
this done is really what the basis of

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,600
what i'm going to talk about for the

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
next 15 to 20 minutes

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,320
so who makes that call yeah and to be

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
effective and to make sure you've got

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,159
that buy-in you really need all of the

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,240
people on the screens to to be bought

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
into to a level

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,600
um that's appropriate you know

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,040
i've worked on teams where we've got

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,038
engineers who are really enthusiastic

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,360
but actually if the product owner isn't

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
bought in

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,920
then it's you know this stuff doesn't

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,080
get prioritized

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,920
if the exec sponsor's questioning why

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,160
we're doing the security stuff

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,599
but the product owners brought in once

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
again it's that friction and all these

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,599
people really really want to do the

71
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,040
right thing

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
but they've got delivery pressures the

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
same as i've got delivery pressures

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
probably everybody else has delivery

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,599
pressures if you don't have those

76
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,680
delivery pressures well lucky you um

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
it's not a place i've ever worked in so

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
so yeah

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,400
that's

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
yeah you probably have other problems

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,480
that you need to solve but but these

82
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,120
this is what i'm really focusing on

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,879
so how do we get that sort of security

84
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,720
agreed aligned

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,920
you know

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,319
so the first really important thing is

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
is understanding your company because

88
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
sometimes you talk to security people

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
and i work for security and it doesn't

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
matter what industry i work for but if

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
you're trying to influence people who

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
actually

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
it does matter

94
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
yeah that's really not going to help

95
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,239
where you're seen as a sort of outsider

96
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,120
so

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,280
if you bought into your company and if

98
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,879
you work for a telecoms company in

99
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,360
telecoms you understand how to what

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,159
telecoms is doing how you make money how

101
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,879
you

102
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,720
what the business goals are

103
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
you can start to build a business case

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
um around what you want to do and that

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
really can resin start to resonate and

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,360
one of the key things is what language

107
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,400
you use

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
and each you know

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
groups of people use language in a

110
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
certain way

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,640
you know you're one of the group you're

112
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
one of the tribe if you use this sort of

113
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
language now if you're trying to get

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
people outside of security to to support

115
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,200
you and help you you need to use the

116
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,120
language they use rather than expect

117
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
them to use your language so i've worked

118
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,159
in companies where we didn't have users

119
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,480
we would have colleagues

120
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,599
we didn't have

121
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
customers we had clients

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,480
now by using those words appropriately

123
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
you sort of show that you're part of the

124
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
group and it's all around you know

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
building those relationships getting

126
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
that empathy you know

127
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,680
because that will help you going forward

128
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
also you know what else is happening in

129
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
the wider environment and i'm not just

130
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,520
talking company

131
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,800
the industry

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
you know cyber was a huge example which

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
to be honest i had to learn the hard way

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
um 15 years ago cyber

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
came out as this huge buzzword

136
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,800
everything was cyber yeah

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,440
even your toaster was cyber

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
i hated it

139
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
to me from a logical perspective it was

140
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,000
a william gibson word that

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,440
meant nothing it was just rubbish

142
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
but one of the bosses took me aside and

143
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
said yep that might be your view

144
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
but when i phone the cfos

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
pa and say i need to speak to the cfo

146
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,039
about information security i might get

147
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,400
to speak to him in two weeks to a

148
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,280
month's time for 15 minutes and i'll get

149
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,000
potentially bumped a couple of times

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
if i phone up and say i want to talk

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
about cyber i'll probably get a meeting

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,520
within two days so by using that wider

153
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,039
sort of

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,000
language environment what's happening

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
that that sort of

156
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,840
yeah that was a real eye-opener for me

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
currently zero trust

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,320
you know

159
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,840
who definitely knows what zero trust

160
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,520
is and if you do talk to the person next

161
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
to you because i bet you they definitely

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,960
know it's something slightly different

163
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
but what does it mean for you what does

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,759
it mean for what you're trying to

165
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,320
deliver how can you use that phrase that

166
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
terminology that other people are using

167
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
around

168
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
around your company the wider

169
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,319
yeah the wider sort of

170
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,080
ecosystem to to

171
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,319
get what you need done

172
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,120
yeah

173
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
and plans strategies roadmaps are really

174
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
important but sometimes things come

175
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
along that knock that out

176
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,560
so you know nobody expected kovid really

177
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,800
a few might have done but

178
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
what we definitely didn't expect was 18

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
months working from home

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
now how many people have refreshed their

181
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,880
vpn infrastructure i would expect lots

182
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
but while that's happening

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,880
can you include posture checking can you

184
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
include linking into mfa

185
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,199
are there other things that you can put

186
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
in place off the back of this change

187
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,960
that's already happening

188
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,000
to to deliver the security that your

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
company needs

190
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
um

191
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,600
for it to be successful

192
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,280
so these are sort of sort of some sort

193
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
of wider areas

194
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,599
the next part couple of few slides are

195
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,479
much more around

196
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
things you can personally do because i

197
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,599
actually like things that are actionable

198
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
and and actions are really important

199
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,520
because if you

200
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
um

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,720
whatever you say

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,039
people will take to a certain point if

203
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,639
you don't back it up with actions it

204
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,440
will just become hollow

205
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,599
and the actions that you do

206
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,000
really drive the behaviors that you will

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,800
see

208
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
and

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
also the behavior

210
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,360
the sort of

211
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,759
team the culture you want to drive and

212
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,039
the first one's probably the most

213
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,199
important you know

214
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,440
ideally what i want is

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,319
someone to walk up to me and go

216
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,840
we did something we didn't really

217
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,360
understand what we're doing i think

218
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,039
we've got a problem

219
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,880
and at that point you've got two things

220
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
you can do you can go

221
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,759
firstly thank you for telling me because

222
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,039
that person probably doesn't want to

223
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,639
admit they're making yeah they've done

224
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,400
something wrong

225
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
and then okay let's sit down let's talk

226
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,440
it through let's see what's happening

227
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
rather than going

228
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,759
oh dear and well

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,080
words that are slightly more robust than

230
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
agricultural

231
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,479
um

232
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
and really getting angry about because

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,879
one one way of doing it means somebody

234
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
will come back again the other means

235
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,240
they're never going to come to you with

236
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,360
a problem

237
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,199
um even better after that event if you

238
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,120
can use company reward system some

239
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,960
companies have these things where yeah

240
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
every month an employee gets a bottle of

241
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
wine

242
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,080
if they get that bottle of wine for

243
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
bringing the problem to you that's a

244
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,319
very visible way of saying

245
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
we're open we're here to help

246
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,080
you know

247
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
sitting down and understanding the

248
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
problem and why it happened sort of

249
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,559
isn't number two which is you know

250
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,799
how do you yeah if you've never worked

251
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
in a delivery team how do you understand

252
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
the pressures they're under you know i

253
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,080
don't know how many people here have

254
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
worked on the delivery team

255
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
i've worked on grad schemes where you've

256
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
had security grads one of the things

257
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,279
i've always recommended is for one of

258
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,440
their six-month rotations they go out

259
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,279
and work with a proper application

260
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
delivery team delivering products for

261
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
customers colleagues clients yeah

262
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
because then you understand that and if

263
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
you do a swap and you get one of their

264
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
grads into security you have a brilliant

265
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
thing where when that person goes back

266
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,040
that grads like a

267
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
little beacon of security understanding

268
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,080
that that's really really useful

269
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,120
um

270
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,360
ultimately you know everybody's trying

271
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
to deliver stuff

272
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
you've got to be realistic

273
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
or you should be realistic and look at

274
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,480
the real risk

275
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,160
yo when someone comes up and says we're

276
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,120
using tls version 1.1

277
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
is that yeah the world's not going to

278
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,279
end um it's not great but i can live

279
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,120
with that for a while so let's take a

280
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,959
risk-based approach let's see when they

281
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,240
can fit it in

282
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,399
and if your standard says it should be

283
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
within four weeks

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
and they can't do it for six

285
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
once again

286
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
what what's the issue there

287
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,160
the final one here security yeah

288
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
we've got a reputation for saying no and

289
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,800
and to be fair quite regularly we do say

290
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,839
no you know

291
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
but a lot of other teams are much

292
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,839
happier for securities to say no than

293
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,640
for

294
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
them to say no and i really push back i

295
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,720
had a great example where

296
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
a team had built this really lightweight

297
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,839
solution for one specific pro problem

298
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,600
they were trying to solve and they

299
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
talked to us

300
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
it was they didn't have the budget for

301
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,079
the enterprise solution but because the

302
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,279
enterprise solution was big it was

303
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,920
they didn't have the money

304
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,720
so

305
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,399
they built their own but they talked to

306
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,160
security and they had the right security

307
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
controls and features it was you know it

308
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,240
was fit for purpose from a security

309
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,720
perspective enterprise architects did

310
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
not like it and understandably because

311
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,160
if you're an enterprise architect you

312
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,920
want one solution

313
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
the enterprise architects told me that i

314
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
had to tell them to say you can't use it

315
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
and the answer is no

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
you're the enterprise architects you go

317
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,920
and tell them because from a security

318
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
perspective it's fine

319
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,279
and that there are a number of examples

320
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,399
where people like security you know

321
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
don't like to tell people no and then

322
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
much rather security did it

323
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,600
and the answer is from me no i'm not

324
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,079
telling i'm not i'm not being the bearer

325
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,279
of all bad news

326
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
the next one was really driven home in

327
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,120
an interview i did

328
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,720
a while back

329
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,600
where

330
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,040
um

331
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
one of the interview guys said

332
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,920
engineering teams don't read standards

333
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,279
standards aren't what they're into they

334
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,800
want to write code

335
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,839
you know they want things that make

336
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,519
their life easier if you give them a

337
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,200
reference architecture that shows you

338
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,279
the components the patterns you know

339
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,880
potentially the pseudo code and if

340
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
you've got some shared services even

341
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
better

342
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,160
that's what they want they want to be

343
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,279
able to

344
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,600
produce the code to write you know

345
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
deliver the solutions they need to do

346
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,959
and

347
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
our job as securities to make that easy

348
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,360
to consume you know

349
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
are you using the right format you know

350
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
does everybody communicate on slack and

351
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
you send emails because if you do you

352
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,639
you're going to miss your target your

353
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,920
audience

354
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
and as much as security is everybody's

355
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
responsibility

356
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,240
sometimes if you they've not read the

357
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,760
email because they're on slack all day

358
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
that's just not going to happen

359
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
the other thing is looking at how you

360
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
deliver yeah does everybody you know is

361
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,959
security still doing waterfalls

362
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,720
and everybody else is on two-week

363
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,880
sprints because if you are

364
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
really you need to change you're not

365
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
going to get the whole of the company to

366
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
change to align with the way security

367
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,959
wants to deliver

368
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,880
and once again this is all about

369
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,160
making it

370
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,279
consumable making it easy

371
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
every organization i've worked in

372
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
they've been teams that like security to

373
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
be honest that's how i got into security

374
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,399
i was doing e-commerce development i

375
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,639
like the security side of it and that

376
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,959
got me in my foothold in security

377
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
where you've got guys that are doing

378
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,920
security and they're doing it well

379
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,440
there's two things

380
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,320
one

381
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,639
cut them some slack sometimes because

382
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,760
actually

383
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
if they can't you know if they can't do

384
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,800
what they need to do they need a little

385
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,639
longer to produce a document they need

386
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,240
some more time to deliver this final

387
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,279
control

388
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,279
really in the grand scheme of things if

389
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,720
they're doing the

390
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
if they're your best examples of

391
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
security

392
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,880
you know be flexible be pragmatic let

393
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
them do it the other thing though is the

394
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
one that really used to annoy me was

395
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,040
when the security team needed

396
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,279
you know evidence of controls being put

397
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,360
in or new control's been put in

398
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
coming into my team and going you need

399
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,880
to do all of these things

400
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,240
it's like hold on a second we've got no

401
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,680
notice

402
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
we've talked about backlogs it's too big

403
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,839
haven't got much time

404
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,360
but also

405
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,959
the team over there you're not talking

406
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:57,680
to

407
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
they don't even do half the stuff we do

408
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,160
and now you're expecting us to do more

409
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,720
so so although it's sometimes really

410
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,800
you know you have to show that you you

411
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
know you're delivering stuff and it can

412
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
be very tempting to go to a team that's

413
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
already doing

414
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,880
security and ask them to do more

415
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,920
it's actually long-term

416
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,600
counterproductive because if they always

417
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
feel that they're getting pressured to

418
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
do

419
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,199
more than everybody else that will

420
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,160
slowly build resentment

421
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,839
finally on this slide is

422
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,959
you know

423
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,040
what's optional

424
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
tls 1.3 it would be brilliant if you

425
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
could do that

426
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
actually tl ssl v3 that's not optional

427
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
tls 1.2 is

428
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,880
okay tls 1.1 we need to go down the

429
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,360
exception route what's that exception

430
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
and explaining to people that there's an

431
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,120
exception route and there's a process

432
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
that allows

433
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,880
yeah risk-based decisions where we can

434
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,440
all agree about what's

435
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,639
what's acceptable what's not acceptable

436
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,720
and that may the decision is made by

437
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
somebody who

438
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
is

439
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,040
appropriately sort of informed

440
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,120
and and responsible for making that

441
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,600
decision allows that sort of visibility

442
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,360
of the end-to-end process you know

443
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
saying you have to do this and that's

444
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,560
all it is

445
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,440
really doesn't help in the long term

446
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,519
so my final

447
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,160
two is actually one thing

448
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
threat modelling i i'm a bit of a threat

449
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,759
modelling geek i think it's fantastic

450
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,720
um

451
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,079
i'm not necessarily talking about

452
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,639
tooling the tooling so much better but

453
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,440
actually as a process as a

454
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,320
um

455
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,959
something to to to deliver

456
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,839
um into into the um

457
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,399
engineering teams into all aspects of

458
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,800
delivery this is brilliant and back to

459
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
the previous slide yeah if you built

460
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
those good relationships with teams

461
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
getting this people to start doing this

462
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
you know is a lot easier

463
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,079
um

464
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,759
and it's brilliant it the difference

465
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,240
this makes in terms of engagement and

466
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,800
ownership is just fantastic the best

467
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,720
example i've seen

468
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,839
is where a colleague was threat

469
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,519
modelling with a team they found some

470
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,720
stuff not

471
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
not

472
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,639
critical yeah but stuff that wasn't

473
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,519
right

474
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,399
um

475
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,399
the team they broke for lunch they came

476
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,279
back

477
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,199
a couple of the engineers were late

478
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
when they arrived back the question was

479
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,800
where you've been said well

480
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
that thing that you found

481
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,000
um we've just gone um and fixed that

482
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,240
it's going into test tomorrow it will be

483
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,519
released

484
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,000
early next week now that level of

485
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
engagement

486
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,360
um i've never seen from a pen test

487
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
because really if you think about it

488
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,480
you know

489
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
a threat model and a pen test are the

490
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
same thing you're just

491
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
slightly different i suppose but you

492
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,880
know one at the beginning of the process

493
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,399
one at the end of the process you still

494
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
get a list of things to fix

495
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,720
but that engagement from threat modeling

496
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,839
you know is just fantastic

497
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,600
and i think the other thing about threat

498
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
modelling is security can get really

499
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
excited by it and sort of

500
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,760
swarm over it and take it over

501
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,439
but the critical thing is if you want it

502
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,839
to be sustainable is to get people to do

503
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,679
it themselves so that they can do it as

504
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,599
part of a stand-up they can do it in

505
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
their planning sessions they can do it

506
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,599
in new feature development

507
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,400
um with security facilitating training

508
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
and providing more

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
um

510
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,520
and

511
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
like i said threat modeling is just just

512
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,799
great there's so many different you know

513
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,919
it's growing so much um as you can tell

514
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,559
i can talk about this for quite a while

515
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,720
um but

516
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,480
you know it doesn't matter which one you

517
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
choose just getting people into that

518
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,039
into the processes thinking that mindset

519
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,240
is just fantastic

520
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,400
so here's the final slide um

521
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
and i think you know

522
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,960
what we've been talking about is

523
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,679
i think captured here is is

524
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
you know

525
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,200
effective security has to be implemented

526
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
there's no point having having that waff

527
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
and never turning it on uh it might take

528
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,640
a compliance box but that's not what i'm

529
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,840
about

530
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,679
relationship matter

531
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,520
probably far more than you

532
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
you probably think at times

533
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
because they they can really turn things

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
around and when you need things done in

535
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,840
a positive way and actually when you

536
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,360
need someone to really help you out if

537
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,120
you've built that if you've done that

538
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,720
build those relationships they'll help

539
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
you

540
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,480
yeah think about this as security is

541
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
customer focused you know what do your

542
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,880
customers want what do they need yeah if

543
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
you think about

544
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,080
would they come to you

545
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,480
in your organization if they didn't have

546
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,280
to

547
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
uh finally get threat modelling it's

548
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
just brilliant fun um

549
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,320
and it's just great

550
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,799
the original call for papers asked this

551
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,960
you know uh asked for presentations to

552
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,360
be linked to uh lyrics preferably the

553
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
beatles i couldn't do the beatles

554
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
uh what it did get to was the rolling

555
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,880
stones

556
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,919
and actually i thought this was

557
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,080
fantastic when i looked at it you know

558
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,520
because of what we're talking about is

559
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
delivering what we need

560
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,000
and

561
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
as it says if you try sometimes you find

562
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,080
you get what you need

563
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,720
so thank you for your time um i hope you

564
