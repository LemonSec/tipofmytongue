1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,759
learn more about elastic um i'll talk

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,759
why i wanted to do that and place it

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,720
through that

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,480
a lot more

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,440
so here's my general

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,980
pre-made what i did and why i did it

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,460
[Applause]

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,730
[Music]

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,149
[Applause]

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
um

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,500
[Music]

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
experience set up my own cluster um so

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,520
there's that single note it's still a

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,719
plus plus

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,680
um

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,039
i want to use different features with

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,600
elastics use log slash files

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
um i want to use a python library for

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,879
interacting with elastic so i didn't

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,039
want

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,069
[Applause]

22
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,119
i wanted

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,609
[Applause]

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,789
[Music]

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,720
um so

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
bringing security i think

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,520
timely security news is really important

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,240
and

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,439
being

30
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,320
having them real time obviously

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,360
there's so many different things to

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,320
monitor

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,720
it's difficult um to like go to all

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,399
these different websites so it's a

35
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,759
solution for that

36
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
i'll see our attention whether um

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,520
see what we do with that

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,590
um

39
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,320
[Applause]

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,759
really nice way to visualize different

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,159
types of data um

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
fancy gas sports graphics utilization

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,560
metrics etc

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,740
um

45
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,818
[Applause]

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,480
um first one was the rss plugin and what

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
this does it calls an rss feed every so

48
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,520
a couple minutes or time you specify i

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
better pull down all the events

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,879
transformers and log stations then

51
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,200
finally

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,480
um

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,760
it's great it seems really simple but

54
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
i found out probably wasn't the best

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
solution

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
um

57
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,770
[Music]

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,000
[Applause]

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,680
credentials um if you give some keywords

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
um and it will pull that data basically

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,239
as well so that's the main point is um

62
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,840
with the twitter youtube information you

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
get retweets the likes

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,959
people tweet to retweet i'm not

65
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,239
retweeting so you can actually kind of

66
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,599
look at trends

67
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
so say you've got a new cd pops

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
um and a lot of hype tv once you see a

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,760
spike if you're doing this correct

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
search and it's a really interesting way

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,280
of actually keeping tabs on what's

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,760
popped at the moment or if there's a cd

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,879
you want to know more about you can

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,400
search for that cd and i asked it with

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
the data there and it brings up if you

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
feed all this information for that cpu

77
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,159
so this is an example rssc

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,859
[Music]

79
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,910
um

80
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,000
[Music]

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
[Applause]

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,439
visualizing better

83
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,439
um

84
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,820
[Applause]

85
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:10,650
[Music]

86
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,399
[Applause]

87
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,600
i was getting all these events over and

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
over and over again into elastic i was

89
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,199
like well i've got that twice

90
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,840
it's useless

91
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,080
um so the way i resolve that is uh the

92
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,440
fingerprint filter would be to take the

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
hatch so i take a half of the title of

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
that article and i use that as the

95
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,440
document id and elastic and so

96
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
again instead of creating a new document

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
you just update the current box

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
so we talked about los angeles pipelines

99
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
uh registered new electric cars ingest

100
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
pipelines these are similar quite hard

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,360
but they're elastic and if you don't

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
think two packs of them i sort of wanted

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,689
[Applause]

104
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,540
[Applause]

105
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,199
to standardize um across all the feeds

106
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,880
uh platinums and visuals

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
so also i think it's really cool

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,080
um

109
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
so on the hunt for more feeds you can

110
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
never have enough beads i was like

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
it's really unscalable to add a mod

112
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,520
slash pipeline for each individual url

113
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,199
there must be a better way so there's

114
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,720
like news api there's like how do these

115
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,240
news apis get all this feed are they

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,919
scraping themselves quite a lot of them

117
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,470
just use google news

118
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:37,740
[Music]

119
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,840
[Applause]

120
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
um

121
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,069
[Music]

122
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,560
there's one major downside

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,880
um

124
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,560
so that brings us into like some

125
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
problems

126
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240
um

127
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
so not everyone's planned so

128
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,639
i didn't talk quite yet but basically

129
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,150
just cd database

130
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,260
[Applause]

131
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
um

132
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:40,419
[Applause]

133
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,720
uh first issue i ran into was with the

134
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
duplication documents the second issue

135
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,560
is it was very strict about the

136
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
attack so it wouldn't like take all the

137
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
feeds it has to be very thought well

138
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
formatted in any sort of issues you just

139
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
would not just in any events

140
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,240
um was really annoying so obviously

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
perfect

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,960
so

143
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,599
whoever run that or

144
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,599
um

145
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
really simple just take

146
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,199
just go to the euro take all the events

147
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,880
and then just convert suggestions of

148
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
work placements

149
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,520
um

150
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,090
[Applause]

151
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:54,359
[Music]

152
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,240
so instead of like saving into a file

153
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,639
indexing it directly to

154
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
elastic similar with

155
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
creating a my own id for the rss i use

156
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,199
the

157
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
cd id so when that cd is updated and

158
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,198
then updated and i asked it

159
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,199
um so we're going to go on to the

160
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,800
results

161
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
so

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,039
hopefully there's a couple of quick

163
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,160
dashboards to

164
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
make some use cases

165
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,039
um

166
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,440
some a bit more fun some are like

167
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
a bit useful

168
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,598
um

169
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,360

keywords

207
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,160
