2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,119
poverty some of the impasse between kind

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:27,419
of make those decisions the trans women

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:29,340
state is new contract is a lot had a

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,140
Pullman more slice in here his bill

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:40,680
alone presentation you probably need

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:42,270
some there's just so much you don't have

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,219
to go and take pictures of take one week

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,719
with that github and you don't have a

10
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,690
female journalist and the source

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,460
material be sent right to do that so

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,180
it's not one of these things where hey

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,539
he said this why any saying should be in

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,710
there

15
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,420
and that way you go and look it up for

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:23,090
yourself sometimes people make mistakes

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:26,460
these change over time license work

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:31,799
arena work it semantics for a number of

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:46,710
years and the different place offer and

20
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:48,659
also started learning about the expert

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,820
you know Creek the status change any

22
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,530
answer some other questions and others

23
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,639
and I look at them I can't enough I

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,119
might answer the question I don't

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,159
understand the question so that and but

26
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,040
but I have learned a lot of them the

27
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,600
glass is the kinds of states that

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,789
developers my company and the open

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,788
source that we use awesome

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:27,610
so first of all these are crypto is more

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:29,500
readily are lots of things crap and I'm

32
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,780
scrubbing in the world you can

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,220
potentially lose your data or

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,310
compromised the security of the data

35
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,620
you're trying to protect and and its

36
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,430
optimum really difficult to tell to

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,019
reduce the cipher guess so

38
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,730
be able to outputs up here one of these

39
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:47,320
is from a program application

40
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,970
another one is pretty good imitation

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:55,209
needs other difference probably got the

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,970
group say hey those are the same they

43
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,709
all been are you not telling something's

44
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,019
broken just by looking at health it's

45
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,760
completely one outlet might not be the

46
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:07,420
first one in my pocket is there any

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,859
money to 10,000 or than them might not

48
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:14,559
see it all and that's the reason like it

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,600
has to kind of figure out that I'm using

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,890
- it's a text from viewers of it a lot

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,579
of times that's way if you're out the

52
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,640
process so here's a real Learning

53
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,640
Network

54
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:51,910
presentation is group earlier on

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:54,100
recently on the green say you have one

56
00:03:51,910 --> 00:04:01,239
job these are crypto right so that

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:04,180
people can decrypt it and so why is

58
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,780
there no hard well first of 2008 is any

59
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,390
value nobility you get into this

60
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,220
beautiful you know look at video for

61
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,798
customers not it's not the greatest

62
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,750
study in the world in to be there it's

63
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,269
hardly just effort run fine college

64
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,478
years people would sign up that they

65
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,478
would

66
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,780
it's easy their flavors of the

67
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:31,030
developers left incomplete something is

68
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:32,530
surely these were simple path and when

69
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:39,280
they found was you guys have bad

70
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:41,919
occupation portable systems and various

71
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,340
security and the one thing all that

72
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:54,910
there's lots of little colleges no

73
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:58,900
documentation so here's an example of an

74
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:01,570
insecure example is test you with job

75
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,010
you source and one of them when you pass

76
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,610
the password to the Java keyboard

77
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,159
basically you don't want to do it as a

78
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,630
string object because it's going to be

79
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,340
in memory until I see your nominee

80
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,310
starts but you're not going to tell me

81
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,919
this particle acted so what they want

82
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,660
password there that way ideally ever use

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,060
it that's what you can serve password

84
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,950
flow today in the earth degree to string

85
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,330
object which means the peppers and

86
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,130
that's right now going heaven again

87
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,520
character array out of there this is

88
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:35,380
holding long he has eight examples on

89
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,640
this everyone thickness and and not one

90
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,040
of them commented

91
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,810
all want you shouldn't do it this way it

92
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,910
does a shortcut is there and show

93
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:54,480
something else but at the same time I

94
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:56,950
screwed up here and people still face so

95
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,150
first work entirely though create

96
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,860
remember biography

97
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,599
hopefully everybody's already heard this

98
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,240
this is really good from the mom and

99
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:12,610
apple pie bring the presentation hope

100
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:30,280
you know I've only encountered one time

101
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:32,470
on one of my products this and hopper

102
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,690
goes Jonathan a Javanese people

103
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,940
takis for his homegrown Chris computers

104
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:41,890
and they don't need me to correct the

105
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:44,920
pokies bertier's proportions don't

106
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,979
expected to be secure and one of the

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,230
things I ordered up to it Mikey people

108
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,310
who read custom algorithms you see an

109
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,000
improvement doesn't lead you to the

110
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,980
piccolo husband Peter patient one

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,030
how do you push crypto produces we have

112
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,440
a questionnaire in your country and then

113
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,359
with each of those questions we have sub

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,890
questions you know if you do this and

115
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,250
tell me is that the other thing about

116
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:12,219
what you do and one time I had this

117
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:19,900
probably creating that using key

118
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:22,360
derivation function answer month or two

119
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,000
later and reading some product and said

120
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,320
hey be protected with a password for the

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,080
month of her replaced derivation

122
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,969
function so I remember this right I

123
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,520
don't think they use it without review

124
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,910
yeah I remember to write it more

125
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,919
denounce what memory News News News and

126
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:46,390
I mean almost II really did was up

127
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,549
see this see that and he said yeah we

128
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,820
doing about we do that in create some

129
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,330
custom irritation but did not utilize it

130
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,790
he created his own head that was a

131
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:01,240
derivation function so my part in there

132
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:04,690
was pants for one question question now

133
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,690
that if you generated he anyway others

134
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:11,500
and random tell me about that question

135
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,210
your conversation tell me more

136
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,150
sometimes I'll fill everything in right

137
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:19,150
I got no problem but lots of times you

138
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:23,260
got to dig in deeper and lots of places

139
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,370
to this questionnaire where it's a fair

140
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,260
question and then I asked a similar

141
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,200
question someplace else we're going how

142
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,880
people try to figure yourself you know

143
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:35,289
too many hash functions then after the

144
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:37,419
little recap well your concrete nerves

145
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:59,520
all explainable anybody

146
00:08:37,419 --> 00:09:02,079
Brian beyond that were cool right now so

147
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:07,810
rich my careful everybody's for Bruce

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:10,270
Bruce there and I'll give another

149
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,979
illustrate something to those pills that

150
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,430
were pretty easy to eat it was in

151
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,480
college

152
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:18,130
Prince Albert perfectly noble any cheap

153
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,260
rates and the same wasn't gonna break it

154
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,360
you see if you would attend this

155
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,060
probably education better nobody goes in

156
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,670
there gradients hope years later he's

157
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,650
going to come in from Kokomo go under

158
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,439
hey there's that curriculum operating my

159
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:38,050
father some great except there was a

160
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,730
home assignment it was he didn't see God

161
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:45,490
news birth though but whether this

162
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:48,280
market model and here we'll go common so

163
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,900
this comes from synopsis hopefully

164
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,880
everybody did this was an office hit not

165
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,740
there a major security vendor hit

166
00:09:51,880 --> 00:10:01,170
officer periodic so you business coming

167
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:07,810
over anyway they found a bug in my DMS

168
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:09,520
and numbers and they're like I guess

169
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,709
this is what very well by holding these

170
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,560
programs that are done without health

171
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,570
care but I see medicine curve and we

172
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,479
never slice that if you created any

173
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:23,920
prayer going around the services not

174
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,890
predetermine our members don't create

175
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,300
your implementation say man I like it

176
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,040
and we're just become particularly

177
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,500
parties with open source whose

178
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,849
components mobile source me pulling some

179
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,740
of our open source of dependency and

180
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,530
some other open source is another thing

181
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,190
and somewhere in that mix my secret that

182
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:47,069
we did so again yeah I'm sorry what's

183
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,070
the risk of you I wanted to accept it

184
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,420
implementation issues overly part you

185
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:58,040
see their openness itself it's a cycle

186
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:00,800
also Venus that's a very large library

187
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,880
now imagine you're somebody you see

188
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,260
little library by pockets unit I like

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:15,770
here the psych eval are always in

190
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:17,750
business that's overrated so protecting

191
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,120
your photographic secrets and versatile

192
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,740
amount of oxygen scripts they're

193
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,090
technically you have apples whatever you

194
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,380
need to protect your secrets

195
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,590
what happened for you know Tara

196
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,750
seriously well my time in can prevent

197
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,190
constant log everywhere they kinda

198
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,410
turned out one of the bitch was in

199
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:41,540
behind campus is that issue was not

200
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:43,189
addressed shaker really cool it is near

201
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,349
fruit my clients have working it over

202
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:48,710
the warden said hey this Cruise was not

203
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,530
all till everyone's news photographers

204
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,510
where they're a few occasions were motor

205
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,980
stops and they've been polished and then

206
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,630
they found out later that they were

207
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,250
overshot that and this Russian burn

208
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,100
understand why say Russia designing a

209
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:07,460
real strike right Keys is signed by us

210
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,690
from of the vendors this is what happens

211
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:13,010
when you're probably to use no longer

212
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:15,620
write it and maybe go in and hey this is

213
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,880
really cool and if he stumbles even icon

214
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,370
covers all three photos were passable

215
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,780
the think this was cooking here we

216
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:34,790
passed became interpretation program

217
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:39,310
saying hey this was not there's also

218
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:44,300
because over person this is movie here

219
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:48,910
obviously but no lottery but they have

220
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,910
to be really really really yeah

221
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,979
so you know want to avoid Dena McRib the

222
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,129
graphical securely and lower graduated

223
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:05,879
brand random map that random person was

224
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:07,889
higher count anyone want to use during

225
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:21,420
the rigor typically what don't mind is a

226
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:22,230
deterministic random ditch so here's

227
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:29,790
what I deserved

228
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:31,620
yeah better I forget to deposit some so

229
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,019
what he's trying to do is try to

230
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,029
probably interface in front of a bunch

231
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,870
of other random number generators I'm

232
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:42,389
not worried about that first one that's

233
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:48,569
great that's correct least early after

234
00:13:42,389 --> 00:14:06,480
very now I'm going to do that one is you

235
00:13:48,569 --> 00:14:09,120
do this even grip though seeing Curtis

236
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:15,300
rendered visionary or miss Redman's 112

237
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:18,720
is a security in 1812 is for people you

238
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:24,050
know like I really like her 28 it I'm

239
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,050
the seasoning bigger than I go to this

240
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:36,449
remote but or people that I've seen some

241
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,399
crazy Swayze guru to liberators taking

242
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,750
this is the name current user name any

243
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,160
things like that let's hash it all

244
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,620
together let's throw it out there that's

245
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,050
my steel it's a terrible way to reduce

246
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,939
overall design money that's what the

247
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,699
secret they are is so you're near the

248
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:53,189
net and used to create economic that's

249
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:56,779
the only humans when she wanted to be

250
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:56,779
large number that please

251
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:03,399
like I said you might have even that

252
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:06,620
reasonable cocktail for the Hat yeah

253
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,870
it's like the you like the system name

254
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:12,199
you have a name you need to apply to

255
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:16,269
characters and then figure out what your

256
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:29,479
off that is if you're going the numbers

257
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:30,949
you're probably probably and you can

258
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,300
sample of them was worth burger says

259
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:41,870
that they do a lot of they're good

260
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,490
though they had a process my friend I

261
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:48,410
think is his mouth line and that was

262
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:51,709
their scene that is so reportable it's

263
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:55,550
not don't do that go find bill since

264
00:15:51,709 --> 00:16:04,339
penalty it's all machine breezy and rear

265
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:05,540
and your windows this is the only time

266
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,490
this is really a problem like you're

267
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,740
negative in society and then you have to

268
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:23,540
go to some crazy stuff trying to use

269
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:46,220
into this extractors I'm a terrible idea

270
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:50,410
resource and this thing was to find a

271
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,410
great group though number one

272
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:02,280
just to give you an idea of how bad is

273
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,699
Camille this goes back through the 2008

274
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:08,849
I believe the Debian developer who's

275
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:12,839
name is an open SSL who's give me a

276
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:16,550
burning room very readers most and what

277
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:25,730
it was it was cached an uninitialized

278
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:28,590
generally in this case was intentionally

279
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,600
coming in you when asked about it a

280
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:35,070
people so he told me what's come under

281
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,840
and didn't answer so we removed it well

282
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,399
purpose that means try to figure out

283
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,320
hopefully there's some data on the stack

284
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,300
we can use hash it up

285
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,980
all groan Angie is our entropies that

286
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:53,250
was not a very social specialty but it

287
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:57,060
was better than 30 Tuesday through that

288
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,820
case date so you have right through qk

289
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,179
specify your guarantee you have over

290
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:06,990
left actually go on the birthday problem

291
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:12,800
assume that a little bit

292
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:16,350
chances are it had ten words after 100

293
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:26,360
and the worst part was it said over 18

294
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:28,800
months for soon as he did original

295
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,159
you just vary the number generator

296
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,889
typical is what would want to create

297
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:41,040
even never met them worse degeneration

298
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:46,970
the iris office of this team they were

299
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:48,990
taking like a system made it was

300
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,470
something you know they were getting

301
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,470
captain

302
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:04,950
everyone screaming sir she wasn't even

303
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,559
differentiate mostly probably would have

304
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:14,760
been differentiable it is a device like

305
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:18,000
a yes key for the look you're out how

306
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,100
people generate nearly important any of

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,420
them generators will Tierra Bayesian

308
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,550
function sirs key basic the derivation

309
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,140
function food mystifying

310
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,260
hurry up others so others that are

311
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,150
non-physical love major they

312
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,640
degenerative like complete measurement

313
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:36,780
is negated your key even if they're

314
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:40,290
passionate absolutely must render this

315
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:43,740
forest see great love story you're just

316
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:46,159
using process parts of it like these are

317
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:51,600
main offices in whatever that's not

318
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:56,130
anybody can you figure out these evil

319
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,760
use data Keys read somewhere use them as

320
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,620
an example these is that Aikido every

321
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,280
instance of the ransomware had the exact

322
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:07,320
same key okay some of the guy goes you

323
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,780
know figures I'll pay that but if he

324
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,899
does I'm running a grouper for that it's

325
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,030
gonna be correct their morals are there

326
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,530
is here you guys we want said he's a

327
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,690
Melbourne that got some Feinstein keys

328
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,809
user software we have some static user

329
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,150
on product today but only people an

330
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,700
estate or we have to correct them every

331
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:39,150
effort shouldn't have a Billy but other

332
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:41,790
county oh yeah so cuter make the first

333
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:45,750
of the ATF escape very very much

334
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:48,300
anything about out with random numbers

335
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,370
is stirring it all up and kind of

336
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:57,240
hardening in your out how the key got

337
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:59,129
generated anything that is an attacker

338
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,730
neither have to have that secret where

339
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,730
happened now

340
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:18,759
[Music]

341
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:23,769
in your presentation everything

342
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:26,289
criticism but do you have a key you know

343
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:29,710
and they just know the process you like

344
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:31,840
a substitution ciphers does not you're

345
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:43,049
not an alligator but the code is there

346
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:49,019
somebody can go and work with is

347
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:49,019
energetic half-assed there's an FTP over

348
00:21:50,639 --> 00:22:02,080
the other side eight nine so it's making

349
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:03,939
encryption key start so I will talk

350
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,750
about four different modes there are

351
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,000
other moves

352
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:11,740
I don't first end these screens with

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,279
them so people thought about these

354
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:25,059
community but I tell Mike I want you to

355
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:26,889
see mo reason I call it max example if I

356
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,620
had a there's good people to tell us one

357
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:32,699
brief or any festivities here is only

358
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,699
one know that supported

[Music]

360
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:54,590
so the line with you so I'm dedicated

361
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:58,520
there's me for commonality the bottom

362
00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:01,429
sells red house created cyberattacks it

363
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:10,670
also means that the size of Texas didn't

364
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:15,290
alter his will over the invocation tag

365
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:17,590
that is created sort of like that and

366
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:23,180
that was recorded media for example

367
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:24,800
database eighty arrows or feel yours you

368
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,690
see them now you either have introduced

369
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,610
or amount of text that can you way to

370
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:34,100
that go you have to create your database

371
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:36,939
table originally so absolute lots of

372
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,939
times to be seen over

373
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,630
I'm not number one defense use

374
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,850
announcements terrorism you never use

375
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,210
amounts of zero again this means you can

376
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:53,750
use it with that particular other for

377
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:56,300
example I need about a minute lots of

378
00:23:53,750 --> 00:24:00,010
times by these are ounces and you should

379
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,419
use it once before I leave member with

380
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:08,300
another key comes along if you use that

381
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:10,850
same memory if you use it or once some

382
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:17,120
practices can happen then that things

383
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:30,830
have that the nonce is usually during

384
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:37,159
our workers birthday Oliver birthday how

385
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:38,840
many people Reuters oh good so what is

386
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,550
the choice of wearing something that's a

387
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:46,399
problem because it's not something we

388
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:49,970
would think with it and the others are

389
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,150
roughly 50% of that some to the people

390
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:56,060
in this room I have a st. birthday it

391
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,680
seems founders community survival

392
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,770
stay here that doesn't seem quite right

393
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:06,290
seems like it Auggie I'm gonna do the

394
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:08,389
math buddy comes up and stranger you

395
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,000
have so many people in the room have

396
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:14,720
another 9.9% she isn't to be where I had

397
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,390
the same birthday and I think they see

398
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:25,640
that just seems wrong but you do the

399
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:30,590
math they not wrong it becomes work why

400
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:33,500
last time I ran the number but you're

401
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:37,250
not what was probabilities did that

402
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,110
repeat it's never going to be zero as we

403
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,890
use friends and other even twice the

404
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:45,350
probability is non zero that sort of

405
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:50,030
screams bird a larger number entomology

406
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:51,230
are spreading but can one keep the

407
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:55,670
number of repetitions that we do

408
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:58,820
something very low likelihood of it

409
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:03,100
happening very low and therefore you

410
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:11,290
have to do some very very high number of

411
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:15,500
operational reasons and then Lester

412
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:17,389
initialization vector what walking

413
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,070
pressure and this is just football

414
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,900
because I need to know the context

415
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,740
perhaps someone that we're not gonna

416
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,840
talk about the next time so lots of

417
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,780
times walking version both able to walk

418
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,760
manipulate the plaintext data based on

419
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,670
something from the previous nutritional

420
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,280
of Italy this block well first time you

421
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:42,980
do it got it has to be in there and

422
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:52,100
that's what Gatti's my knees were not

423
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:54,260
serious first off PC mode needs only

424
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:59,120
secured rules you could missing a lot of

425
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:02,390
data yes we cease the violence any other

426
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,500
user it is insecure evidences is going

427
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,500
to have a repeat of

428
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:13,050
that's why it's rarely intentionally

429
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:20,490
just not how intentional and because

430
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:24,060
operation will help me that previous so

431
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:26,970
what I said intentionally well it turns

432
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,950
out that EC is the default remember I'm

433
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:32,340
talking about that

434
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:36,450
default script it was hard your laundry

435
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,970
system are in Java but it turns out that

436
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:42,780
the default ones crypto provided

437
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,100
intended so an idea provider could use

438
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,450
something different from the Sun Fire

439
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,830
released a new different than XYZ but

440
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,970
the defaults undergo provider to

441
00:27:49,830 --> 00:28:01,530
conflict Java world of another new ta

442
00:27:52,970 --> 00:28:05,370
can you specify going over there this

443
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:11,120
wouldn't even see me antenna to talk

444
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:11,120
about the pleasure I'm jittery varieties

[Music]

447
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:20,850
try now in another eight dancers a sense

448
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,000
that if you don't specify an IV some

449
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:26,610
library will generate night before you

450
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,030
but that was not the case they work with

451
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:33,590
these two and they didn't meet and it

452
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,590
was a bad thing that we were doing that

453
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:42,540
job is nothing wrong with this problem

454
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:45,680
that's what - same thing I don't

455
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,680
understand why it's not

456
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:59,029
counter but in this case is not cysteine

457
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:01,700
light anomalies and every time you go to

458
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:04,070
the counter every block it's encrypted

459
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,889
that might be beneficial I think it's

460
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:10,668
that's why they built in to come in at

461
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:12,799
one time and you know using one time we

462
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:14,450
can simply use any that ID cost is

463
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,918
what's your attorney visible in a number

464
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:23,929
harold o'malley time you said however if

465
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:26,179
you have multiple streams with x then

466
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,789
typically what happens is a partition at

467
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:29,419
sixteen blank spaces and not space in

468
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:33,379
the knowledge base

469
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:34,909
I can be named you can do it any better

470
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,389
than one as long as the promise of the

471
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:42,529
end of the business so you know how to

472
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:52,668
do eight do you do my higher to the

473
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:58,490
point of what everyone's however it

474
00:29:52,669 --> 00:30:01,899
really happen about because the cybertek

475
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:04,279
that you live from decrypted the same

476
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:10,070
kept working the other deaths people on

477
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:14,380
the export of plain text that will allow

478
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:17,629
you to actually potentially determine a

479
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:20,210
person purely very heat but I like

480
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:30,409
someone it's a good individual to see

481
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:38,029
that and you can see that's have two

482
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:41,450
pictures on the bottom now touch is not

483
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:46,360
is original self on the bottom all we

484
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,360
know aunt I'm going to hear it out

485
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:55,139
so some problems with an armful explicit

486
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,290
use of the I mean I'm going to put ten

487
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,150
data streams these duplicate IP at zero

488
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:05,389
but I didn't want to I give whatever

489
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,390
it's the everyone's that's a problem

490
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:27,750
more insidious one didn't really because

491
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:29,280
overlap so I say we start up let's say

492
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm confused about the program news

493
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:36,330
developer and I think I was supposed to

494
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:39,780
be the one to do it so I do one gate a

495
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:49,320
to here then I did one today and I start

496
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:55,800
icon 0 20 of the 0 obviously and so some

497
00:31:49,320 --> 00:32:16,139
of my counters sent me a thousand now I

498
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:17,820
start with one if I just have a this is

499
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,080
not something it's an average person's

500
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:31,530
going to see how many feet around

501
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:33,540
somebody was skill will be able to not

502
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,610
that long ago was they were just

503
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:49,610
generating random I mean I think what

504
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:53,490
Sisu knows how many times I mean it and

505
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:55,789
so this is one of the outlet was in it

506
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,159
be broken one or not

507
00:32:55,789 --> 00:33:00,350
perfect example of that you could run

508
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,789
that a thousand times ten thousand times

509
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:09,678
and then it might not get over life or

510
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:10,940
or you get a rough on two times you

511
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,190
don't know what's gonna happen

512
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:23,419
that's what see these wonderful do you

513
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:26,359
see them I love them I love this boat

514
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:30,200
going to put all of us back extreme they

515
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:32,299
wouldn't ECMO is doesn't break because

516
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,609
there's so many places throughout I

517
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:36,739
really are and that's what everyone

518
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:42,139
think about it was hard there's a lot of

519
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:45,470
places so the nonsense provided by the

520
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:51,709
film is used to generate ninety this

521
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:58,999
recommended and

522
00:33:51,710 --> 00:34:05,090
character and that's but he also knows

523
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:17,750
this a lot like every kid even once we

524
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:26,199
hope ordinary past practice so you have

525
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:28,969
one key is you create as much data that

526
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:31,219
happens there like now we're just going

527
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:33,199
to generate mana my these words but as

528
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:39,949
much as we need to work them or a hot

529
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:41,868
for mom doesn't really doesn't who's

530
00:34:39,949 --> 00:35:02,240
also supportive I love it we're not

531
00:34:41,869 --> 00:35:04,720
there and go I mean you're the last one

532
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,720
so I guess

533
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:30,200
so different tags I saw a quote somebody

534
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,180
who he did not back it up stacking

535
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,490
stranger but he sounds like he really

536
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,319
knew what he was talking you know I'm a

537
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,720
big cricket expert so I have to provide

538
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,670
long weather people always like I like

539
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,750
the references a partner to the provider

540
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:46,369
but at the same time kind of we got me

541
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:50,240
he said if you're cooking more than one

542
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:54,290
megabyte of data isn't going to get now

543
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,049
the 64 that's it numerous the small and

544
00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:04,400
never makes bad my client if you do that

545
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:07,520
you're she's gonna taste adult by 60 and

546
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,880
ID I should not get pretty little put it

547
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,460
hacker and they should not use this

548
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:22,670
becomes particularly important again go

549
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:26,150
back to counter mode what is constantly

550
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,850
the idea is that is not securely that is

551
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,410
as predictable as per difficult and big

552
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:33,529
I've seen people go to the rink the guy

553
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:35,180
the first time I think he ponies missing

554
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,000
key and I see my to eat whatever I feel

555
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,299
changes these updated same thing over

556
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,300
and over

557
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:54,020
fewer these are a little bit we're doing

558
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,970
is for somebody to donate see family the

559
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:01,400
ceasing of asking people diversity

560
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:04,939
varieties it's not insecure this is

561
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:18,170
what's not taking persisting white but

562
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:20,270
and I think it's not a secure might get

563
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,040
a fix it but it's a big flashing light

564
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,020
to me to go I need to look at their

565
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,670
stuff a little bit more closely got this

566
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:32,420
wrong reviews about other community

567
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:34,640
seven them one tiny cut a length of

568
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:40,250
eight planets wearing that hell that

569
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,670
came from my evidently life but here we

570
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,150
go

571
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:47,270
I've gotten is pretty cool alright easy

572
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:49,880
beautiful angry and it wasn't how bad

573
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:51,619
that would be I'm not an expert

574
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,900
decrypting these things but I bet

575
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,859
anybody wanted to start doing that kind

576
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:01,250
of stuff to say

577
00:37:54,859 --> 00:38:02,960
I like that places so fast into various

578
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,080
though I concerned on this is pretty

579
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:10,430
much everywhere see you can have it

580
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,630
issue with 91 encryption just one you

581
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,060
have a compile-time constant your

582
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:17,200
history on the other hand with the other

583
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,640
bucks takes at least two you scrub and

584
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,770
the simple way to deal with most of this

585
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:27,799
stuff never never use more than I might

586
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:31,580
need good it's going to take more work

587
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:39,050
life awaits or issues if you started

588
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:41,270
multiply these but same key yeah here's

589
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,849
one that's that's the hearts to find

590
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:47,759
information and the one my breakup is

591
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:50,279
where Enterprise enterprise class base

592
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:57,479
Yuja nominative I don't know how many

593
00:38:50,279 --> 00:39:01,769
people actually although ii mostly some

594
00:38:57,479 --> 00:39:08,279
information more data you incur 13 more

595
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:10,198
goethe do the guidance on this headed

596
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:15,139
this comes from above I should I reverse

597
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:21,829
and come out person well they should

598
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:21,829
either 30 walk walk

599
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:30,559
so do the 30 blocks I'm a pariah basis

600
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:30,559
before to support you and then to this

601
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:42,209
doesn't matter having ended obviously

602
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:43,678
has been one the receipt I was honored

603
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:46,019
as reserve a collision do their birthday

604
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,809
involved in service in DC so we will put

605
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,999
them this evening

606
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:53,219
remember see see what happens is it AC

607
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:56,459
version of the previous block exports

608
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:59,399
that plane test and increase that you

609
00:39:56,459 --> 00:40:03,749
got well more data we do start creating

610
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:06,359
for that encrypted text more like more

611
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:10,169
likely we are to generate an exact same

612
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:13,049
16 bytes generated previously and after

613
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:15,359
heard the problem because if that 16 is

614
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:17,880
the same and the plain text everything

615
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,130
happens to be same or similar to create

616
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,529
the beginning about that block and you

617
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,469
can hold a detective can they go it's

618
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:28,259
just about today that's girly that yeah

619
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:32,069
he dealt with those limits lost that

620
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:36,929
happening to come down to it was to the

621
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:37,889
48 really low numbers we're going to go

622
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:42,839
higher

623
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:44,459
how are they off but there's a recent

624
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,649
paper they're doing this Peter knows to

625
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:50,729
say there's other some other counter

626
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:53,669
most other issues would encounter so

627
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:54,269
AIDS just limiting also diffuse 32 as

628
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:57,078
well

629
00:40:54,269 --> 00:41:01,399
my troubleshooter cording that up here

630
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,399
anywhere to be supported by sissies

631
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:08,200
and here we go

632
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:10,600
how much gave you one of the how much

633
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,569
data do we do with authority do I want

634
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,060
to go my only gonna worry about how much

635
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:19,720
data while using support you get like

636
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:21,790
well let's say I'm gonna have data you

637
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:31,029
say for the next 30 years I don't have

638
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:34,960
to worry about rewriting so the best

639
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:37,420
attack today might be to the 40 but you

640
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:47,140
know last month there was a new attack

641
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:49,540
on sha-1 it was about 13 times faster if

642
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,879
I have to be the need funding that used

643
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:55,570
to be infeasible must've hurt become

644
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:59,710
easily 10 years male 20 years has helped

645
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:06,310
in actually so instead of going for 64

646
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:09,370
gigabytes my money really cautious in

647
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:12,370
one big TV that's what the data here the

648
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:16,589
graffiti guerrilla one of those that

649
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:16,589
kind wealthy tempted for that important

650
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:37,090
grandma's recipes presentation on that

651
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:51,460
earlier and over here is one s of the

652
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:53,590
arson or it's because look at it

653
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:57,820
turn what your risk level is or you know

654
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:59,890
gets up or not Shawn

655
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,860
they like these shamans with learning

656
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:05,730
more engagement

657
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,730
i'ma wherever I go

658
