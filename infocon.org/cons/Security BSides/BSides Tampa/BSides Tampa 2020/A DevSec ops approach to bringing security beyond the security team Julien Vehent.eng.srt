1
00:01:51,480 --> 00:03:24,579
so this is going to be this is one of

2
00:01:58,330 --> 00:03:27,239
the reasons I need to do some and it's

3
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,239
you need it now

4
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,380
and

5
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,380
[Music]

6
00:03:35,489 --> 00:05:15,520
the security teams each grow an

7
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:17,609
interview tomorrow in to me that doesn't

8
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,750
sound right

9
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:26,530
our useful we have periodic regions when

10
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,199
your musicians do anything useful it is

11
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,650
where prayer

12
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,330
but it's not the Verizon TIR report that

13
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,669
Public Security the next recruit of

14
00:05:34,330 --> 00:06:19,870
launched an offensive press that means

15
00:05:36,669 --> 00:06:23,020
nothing and what organizations men

16
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,870
between zero change your company by the

17
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:39,700
neutral cybersecurity Maximus that's a

18
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:50,919
lot 10% of money to poor people were

19
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:53,200
just there information services over 124

20
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,169
convenient if you were a venture if you

21
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,360
did this for eight years cover under

22
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,940
you're doing great on city right now

23
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,460
right but I don't get the sense that

24
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,110
really common our security or or disease

25
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,719
that we're doing and surely there is

26
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,990
something that we're missing here how we

27
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,050
come forward do organizations think that

28
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,440
we provide money this is policy because

29
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:20,110
software development life cycle works

30
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,330
developers and business folks and in

31
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,910
product owner is etc are going to be

32
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,948
like we have a major business need need

33
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,330
to build software they're super smart

34
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,200
people that come up with a perfect

35
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,919
design

36
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,570
and then it would go and implemented how

37
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,400
this proof that works great

38
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,130
you have to test it was it 16 years he

39
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:49,229
was great there I go to this deploy and

40
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:51,760
when security comes in to me first

41
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,620
and I'm guessing your career with that

42
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,770
situation you move even those things

43
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,170
right so security said but but what do

44
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,060
you see you are you can't do

45
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,950
community first so security is I got I

46
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,170
need to get seriously there's almost too

47
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,229
much today Matt mmm two weeks people I

48
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:10,000
am one week maybe but not sure the

49
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,620
security stuff reviewing the project and

50
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,140
once we start working in the project

51
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,500
realized it's a freaking REST API it was

52
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,090
a database we have both or anybody who

53
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,460
they use the same framework than used

54
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,830
for the past three years it's really not

55
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,430
that bad right it's not doing anything

56
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,159
fancy

57
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:33,039
I find this is good you guys can go but

58
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:34,660
don't dig right and so the occasions are

59
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,030
going to deployment - Tony - it's late

60
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,620
right and we had this culture eternity

61
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:43,630
the one that we and we hated by the way

62
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,870
this in my organization took and I'm

63
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:50,350
fighting you but it's there this capture

64
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,430
of talk to security and I hear engineers

65
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,720
say it all the time

66
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:59,349
it bugs me man if you want a rule to

67
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:03,460
apply award talk to security right can I

68
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:06,580
use it in each other six was is well

69
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,620
total security why didn't you talk to

70
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,570
security to you the industry standard

71
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,210
that's used anywhere on the planet it's

72
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,470
of course you can use a clear concise

73
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,570
we're adding a new pitch that website in

74
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,360
this one pet peeve of mine you're

75
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:22,150
changing something in a major mature

76
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,100
production application in each totally

77
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:28,120
security kind of go to web application

78
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,590
if I award for that page why no security

79
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,380
teams have a preference you submitted

80
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,450
organizations

81
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,010
and then you have the you away he's a

82
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,590
new developer that you choose this

83
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:41,640
they'd like to do work can they talk to

84
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:43,740
security first okay okay I guess I get

85
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,560
trained don't go close to that's pretty

86
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,770
business to me I want to be and the main

87
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,339
problem analysis is that this country

88
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:55,920
what forces we need organization

89
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,140
anything so it's security decisions in

90
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,510
choose an enzyme security more and what

91
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:05,160
that does is first it's Lewis Daily News

92
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:11,700
and the truth doesn't scale it doesn't

93
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:14,060
scale money at ten percent of it you

94
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,440
wouldn't be great you continue to use it

95
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,510
at the second one and the one that I

96
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,210
think is being used and I'm really

97
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,939
worried about is that you dissolves

98
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:27,090
developers no creators I'm caring about

99
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,740
security imagine if Luthor's tell you

100
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,570
I've carried the voice trade data

101
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,280
security over there they go check it for

102
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,140
me

103
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,300
that doesn't make any sense it is not

104
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,650
our job to make sure that the code that

105
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,990
is being reached by developers and

106
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,300
operators is properly written these our

107
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,860
job to define how that could should be

108
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,719
written in the first place and it is

109
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,750
their job to do it in to produce

110
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,110
recognition building codes but when we

111
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:56,550
have this culture gives also that he was

112
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:59,910
pretty insecure and an organizations are

113
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,319
in this situation and their fame has

114
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,110
spent a lot of money on cybersecurity

115
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,270
and on getting any results they come up

116
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,000
with excuses as to why things are not

117
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,800
working in somebody else's course more

118
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,720
and more and more and more to do since

119
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,670
we're doing ten years ago then we're

120
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,740
adding one more layers of security car

121
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,969
accident techniques in people and it's

122
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,970
still not providing mobile

123
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:27,870
so a few months ago I was reviewing a

124
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:30,030
security investments in my team and I

125
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,380
was cooking 20 management where

126
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:36,870
everything was all time and my love fest

127
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,170
we seem to be very under invested in

128
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,990
infrastructure security is that is that

129
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,199
home is that good

130
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,580
gonna set me and have you scratch my

131
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:57,600
head course I can't hear a thing about

132
00:11:47,580 --> 00:12:00,480
it like well it's true and I started

133
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,880
looking in how we're doing

134
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,090
well party will you listen we test in

135
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,090
just a few tests and web applications

136
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:11,240
all right moving yet housing spending

137
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:14,100
where are the issues is that right Sarah

138
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,610
before yesterday I think I think

139
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:21,720
investments make sense over what you're

140
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,580
doing what we have matured our UW's

141
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,610
environments to the point where if we

142
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,540
use service it's for them into a secure

143
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:32,370
by default environment we have to find

144
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,500
our web application security

145
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,390
requirements we want the developer to

146
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,810
know what active we did well with in the

147
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,449
end

148
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,969
dean best and positive security because

149
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,190
at this point the operations and the

150
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,630
developer are the ones that you were

151
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,310
essentially doesn't want in charge of

152
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,900
keeping it this way we still run the

153
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,989
test and we were detected regression in

154
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,280
conference but I'm not gonna good as

155
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,070
Calvin and Hobbes

156
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,319
how to open a file they know how to do

157
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,520
it

158
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,710
define these rules in the first verse

159
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,290
they have grateful business and decide

160
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:10,410
how since you include people secure and

161
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:14,199
maintain Elizabeth so within the policy

162
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:18,370
and when the intercept has

163
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,140
this is vastly different when I join

164
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,100
this cloud services group it was it up

165
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,810
around 2015 who were massively invested

166
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,450
infrastructure security most of the time

167
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:31,030
was backed security because we have this

168
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:34,420
new world we're going to wrap up the way

169
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:37,050
we do deployments and AWS and we do

170
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,760
figure out what that means

171
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,040
what's the right way to shave the PVC

172
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,500
was the right place to how do we

173
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:49,510
connect to yes together what said once

174
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:52,060
an IM wants to know what time you spent

175
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,510
on infrastructure security but you

176
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:59,500
supposed to do this thing only once I

177
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:00,880
see a lot of teams this day

178
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,140
infrastructure security to keep

179
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,080
maintaining their infrastructure

180
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,340
whatever and that's what they didn't do

181
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,650
the poster city

182
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,410
I don't want to meet in fireworks for

183
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:19,900
the rest of my life about me I'm doing

184
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:21,339
other than this other of course we can

185
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,410
get to the part where we get leads to

186
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:29,170
infrastructure security so much process

187
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,230
was Road and the moment I joined the

188
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:35,920
group and today what I want to talk

189
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:41,020
about is and I'm gonna share a bunch of

190
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:57,699
the tools that you can use in your

191
00:14:41,020 --> 00:15:01,020
organization you can inspire your bank

192
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,100
in 2015 I was a security engineering and

193
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,540
intersection of the SEC team we're

194
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,620
getting in people when they did open the

195
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,209
VPN property

196
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,600
car weren't directly embedded with

197
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:14,819
operation steaming center etc and one of

198
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,829
the operations manager said look I'm

199
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:18,899
going to do this without saying and

200
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:21,599
we're gonna do the security of it too

201
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,860
and I don't want to do it was it was a

202
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,749
team that doesn't understand what we're

203
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,610
talking about something they look for

204
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:29,519
secure each you to join the team and

205
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,220
help out and figure out with us how we

206
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:47,490
do security individuals do you want me

207
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:49,769
to security that's my comfort zone this

208
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,540
unit yes I would enjoy this thing I look

209
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,249
pretty much this it's fine

210
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,469
this is where we were I kind of know

211
00:15:53,249 --> 00:16:01,499
maybe it needs a scam I mean it's early

212
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:04,079
but I decided to try it out and this is

213
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:06,179
this is pretty much myself working in

214
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,339
these are the rest of the operations

215
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,889
even have the security it makes it

216
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:14,929
becomes awkward for approaching is an

217
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:14,929
Operations team is like I know the truth

218
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:25,199
- have a long piece and so do you

219
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:29,219
operations books so I couldn't define

220
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,740
that all wisdom and angry and using

221
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,809
enough and I knew that trying to play

222
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,369
the old mighty city region you would not

223
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:40,769
work well so as you step back - I figure

224
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:42,029
out how to work was that team because it

225
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:45,029
was a great chief instructor for me I

226
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:47,999
used to be part with security a member

227
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:50,040
of an Operations team right so I know

228
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:51,720
enough of operations and I've uses a man

229
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,209
and I know how to do that sport enough

230
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,100
that it was important to me the student

231
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,018
culture is different maybe the character

232
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,860
it is about waking up in the middle of

233
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,860
the night for securities

234
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,700
that's their ability than they are

235
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,439
on-axis

236
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,780
of course right so yeah the European

237
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,670
languages community in show that you can

238
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,240
communicate at the same level so I

239
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:18,030
realized what I needed and is is a

240
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,190
project that could contribute to the

241
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,109
team to show them that I was on the side

242
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,370
and white and useful and I wanted to

243
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,919
continue didn't help

244
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,669
and thankfully this project was

245
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,680
privileged and it over to me not matter

246
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:34,380
one of my hoodie

247
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,940
shortly before joining the team and in

248
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:43,230
twenty in up and it so was with

249
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,150
the absolute mastery of very senior each

250
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,460
year who has a mom who commands millions

251
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:52,370
millions of times and once the commands

252
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,370
go sideways he pushed the repository

253
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,520
yeah we got lucky was a project but

254
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,590
still not a great voice encouraging to

255
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,420
be you so really we're gonna figure out

256
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,679
secrets management obviously experienced

257
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:27,660
system doesn't work so well mostly

258
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:30,060
pretty here I guess I this together and

259
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,070
this was very different from my usual

260
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,659
approach to solving problems as a

261
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,030
secreting to you the way and all these

262
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,130
thought problems is if somebody told me

263
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,810
to have a problem and go in my corner I

264
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,690
come up with a state of the art of the

265
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:47,100
perfect world of a person and then they

266
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,780
can be back tends to use this handy this

267
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,320
is where like I don't care just make it

268
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:54,030
fit but here he wouldn't have worked

269
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,179
I needed to make sure that whatever I

270
00:18:54,030 --> 00:19:00,470
will remove this exactly into there and

271
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:03,410
so I sat down with you of each

272
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:07,789
and we came up with this notion of like

273
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:11,410
I came to figure out how we are going to

274
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:14,150
do secrets deployments in the AWS world

275
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,980
with those kidding groups where systems

276
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,169
are managed by the border with created

277
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,940
humanity a director this is everybody 15

278
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,169
men nowadays these solutions exist it's

279
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,210
known as instructing those prosecutors

280
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:28,250
pretty to secrecy and user access to

281
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:30,020
stem the subtitle here sucks what

282
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:37,520
happens when security guys write up

283
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:43,580
stool is it's not as terrible as they

284
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:46,908
actually like it so what we did here is

285
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,470
we essentially thought it was this is

286
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:50,169
what we could do today that's pretty

287
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:54,350
easy you can you stop seen a black box

288
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:55,909
GG we push our secrets to the good

289
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,830
coming Jenkins would move that great

290
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:59,659
speed these instances and down like this

291
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,990
quick people realize that wasn't really

292
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:10,990
work because we need to keep what about

293
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:10,990
we use music EMS music intensifies

294
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,419
[Music]

295
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:26,390
was a rule like young injured that uses

296
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,850
encrypted essentially willing to

297
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:35,630
sacrifice because the structure of the

298
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:38,959
document so you can see the cool thing

299
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:44,030
about this process is that I said time

300
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:47,299
ago to number four the operations team

301
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,639
had back to design heavy to what

302
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:52,309
they wanted and I had kept the 6pd

303
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,320
requirements to what I usually wanted to

304
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:57,710
provide this compute perspective now

305
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,689
they meet one is yes this is great

306
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,549
that's exactly what I mean Gogu that I

307
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,720
only had one problem this was just a

308
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:04,720
drawing on a white wedding night

309
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,220
but I mean I ain't see well character

310
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:15,310
behind within a few weeks with the help

311
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:19,510
of a few better developers and me we

312
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:31,389
have excellent work we're putting up you

313
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:34,300
know but I need you project what what's

314
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:38,830
interesting to me decided to read Zell

315
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:41,440
is that a hint just really security to

316
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:46,120
it Edwards know for action on tools the

317
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,830
DC security in that mindset is very very

318
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,649
important it's not about the security

319
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,379
tool it's about getting the job done

320
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,780
10-week security side of it and that was

321
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,460
very successfully reduce that all a

322
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,399
bunch of other initiatives extra work

323
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,020
because it allowed us to have buy-in

324
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,820
from the engineering team in the

325
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,680
operations teams from day long and it

326
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,250
also defined an opera but we never

327
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,100
prayed for the being which is instead of

328
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,840
having teams that were disconnected

329
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,629
security in operations where security

330
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,949
was essentially embedded in operations

331
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,290
you carry the weight we're part of the

332
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,870
same meetings if there is an incident or

333
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,460
a brush on you to end your whisset II if

334
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,560
it's in the middle of the night we can

335
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,900
have wasted heat and overtime

336
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,360
sentry becomes part of operations

337
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,600
operations homes security

338
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:41,790
decrease and work together and solve

339
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:45,159
problems together at the time I was

340
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:49,450
directly in the same team as the

341
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:51,190
operations falls and as we grew there 84

342
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,469
defense attorney intervene now so it's

343
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,049
too bitch you just won teams with

344
00:22:53,469 --> 00:23:02,119
we didn't report to the same to the same

345
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:03,679
manager Louis and this model is very

346
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,629
different from what you typically see in

347
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,909
organizations where in organization you

348
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:10,609
generally see the centralized it's acute

349
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:12,649
urbanization and that's typically a

350
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:16,158
chief security who's a few security

351
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:18,199
teams in pieces and that is a separate

352
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,879
organization entirely from the

353
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,559
engineering groups but we have a reserve

354
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:27,468
is a distributed security organization

355
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,359
what we have teaching some three books

356
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:33,889
that I would like to talk able to talk

357
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:49,089
to see but the security teams don't

358
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:51,978
report the engineering department I

359
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:58,789
reports to a division of pratfalls

360
00:23:51,979 --> 00:24:00,559
that is in charge of we are part of the

361
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:04,129
main difference between the two and

362
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,649
that's very important is that in the

363
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:09,549
centralized model security is a separate

364
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:11,988
concept whereas in the distributed model

365
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:14,599
security is part of the public

366
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:17,389
organization pal center security is part

367
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:21,320
of the Holocaust we're here it's not

368
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:23,678
part of its effort and when you're at

369
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,119
the board level the directive of

370
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,200
identifying security as a separate cost

371
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:32,178
center changes the approach to security

372
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,639
because in that unit we can't have that

373
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:38,500
our Center if you want to hear you can't

374
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:41,260
do things it changes everything

375
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,140
and those what else security people to

376
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:48,300
have better interactions with the

377
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,300
developer and operations now there's a

378
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:56,409
in the distributed model it's a simple

379
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,920
one it's not different securities to do

380
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,360
the same job here is to get their

381
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,950
directives on the site so or the legal

382
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,050
department is you have to use the same

383
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,520
word for do he doesn't necessarily mean

384
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,050
it's not because Rita sighs

385
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,150
organization's getting orders from a

386
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,159
site so that your requirements for any

387
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,650
different particularly use grants come

388
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,200
from outside the organization in fact

389
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:22,740
compliance in the majority of the

390
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,740
components work is a security operations

391
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,830
the fact that if you don't do security

392
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:32,889
is just because we need to be precise

393
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,889
[Music]

394
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:39,070
the model that I like if you are in a

395
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,959
psychic-type organization and many of

396
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:44,860
the most organizations render smaller

397
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,290
they can't move away from it is to try

398
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,179
to change them in embedded which

399
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,610
effectively means you take your security

400
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,800
engineers and you give them to other

401
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,510
teams and I'm betting here this for

402
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,240
meeting it's not just that you get your

403
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:01,540
security people to go spy on the other

404
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:05,200
engineering changer it means if you have

405
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:07,870
any security engineer that goes internet

406
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,670
to the manager of that dead team contend

407
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,010
the security junior college to work on X

408
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,720
next because deedie for example moving

409
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,940
to you already framework or gonna deploy

410
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,450
in three weeks I wanna know that it's

411
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,940
secure

412
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,860
and it needs to be done now and that

413
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,240
engine you may go back to the security

414
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,979
monitor it's in hand you should buy

415
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,590
hurry because it need to work on some

416
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,800
things out of it and yes it's ok let's

417
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:32,320
now consider XML but you essentially the

418
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,330
engineering managers how to say what the

419
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,149
security people's work on and they can

420
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,500
Adamic that suitable

421
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,110
that's a better communication channel

422
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,970
don't go what else the security to use

423
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:47,800
to get information to might be promising

424
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:52,060
to go through the entire disconnect

425
00:26:47,800 --> 00:27:02,710
positions so you don't have to figure

426
00:26:52,060 --> 00:27:05,590
out the stations are that's not a

427
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,720
process you can have a reverse process

428
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,510
where the developers are allowed to

429
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,190
participate and contribute to security

430
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,440
organization we cause a security

431
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:18,960
channels you an easy way to do this is

432
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,150
if you're running a security training

433
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,590
the people who comes at security

434
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,020
training but they're you're joining us

435
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,730
they have an interest in security they

436
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,550
want to hear from the security team they

437
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,400
want to make progress and use that rids

438
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:35,080
of their career and it's it's very easy

439
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,520
to create a security champion

440
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,490
organization just think that people are

441
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,379
interested in hearing promises and but

442
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,320
the way you just is still matters you

443
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,480
can't run a CG Bluestar security

444
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,490
organization it has a great campus you

445
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,860
open your doors could you share a

446
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,140
presenter need to show users really fast

447
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,270
and to share your incident report need

448
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,540
to show you the best marriages on it why

449
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,629
can't I put your stuff anyway because

450
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,629
it's just

451
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:07,409
this models work and effectively what

452
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:28,600
they about you to do they allow you to

453
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:32,049
avoid having to make assumptions the

454
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,539
main core of a security is to get all

455
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:36,490
assumptions and there many ways to do

456
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:39,760
this some of them are technical some of

457
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:42,820
them are cultural but right before you

458
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,260
go spend three years in a year project

459
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,080
to get visibility into every single

460
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,870
endpoint in just talk to people first

461
00:28:47,080 --> 00:29:00,210
and it seems a lot easier and a lot less

462
00:28:49,870 --> 00:29:24,729
expensive than spending two million on a

463
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:28,059
lot of these issues as security know is

464
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:31,860
that if you're glad what you do is we

465
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:36,279
may have noticed some time last year in

466
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:43,080
many that we had a little issue with our

467
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:43,080
extensions in fact every single Firefox

468
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:52,170
at the same time at a very specific time

469
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:54,419
stand on these of course at midnight

470
00:29:52,170 --> 00:30:07,560
because this issuers will hide almost

471
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:11,880
broke now today and I was on - abused in

472
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:15,810
a trailer in Arizona when my boss

473
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:20,660
Courtney said well the computer might be

474
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:24,030
you know that open I can use

475
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:28,280
now let's interesting about this the

476
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:31,740
technical issue were expensive in God

477
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:35,760
but what we need happen is that when I

478
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:39,000
took over the management of the PPI that

479
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:44,310
sounds I connected information about how

480
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,590
the process works and what I either was

481
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:49,830
sort of understood doesn't matter is

482
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:53,280
that I don't want to get expiration is

483
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,750
ignored by fibers and so I just created

484
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,820
certificates that we're ready for two

485
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,650
years and what we can to sortition work

486
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,260
about to rule out two new certificate

487
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,760
but production since came up and we

488
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,260
didn't do it in time and what I want

489
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:11,700
doesn't matter because my box ignores

490
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:16,010
explorations of certificates anyway in

491
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:24,000
fact the real was that by proxy knows

492
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:29,100
excursion of inspiration so when they

493
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,710
each mediate expired it was up don't

494
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,689
make assumptions good that's this thing

495
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,300
don't make something yeah there are

496
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,060
examples if you be there's a fantastic

497
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:43,919
you know Times article on what went

498
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:46,200
wrong with the Boeing 727 and the rule

499
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,030
of it is we people making assumptions on

500
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,390
which systems for enable the movements

501
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:53,300
plans and

502
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:55,490
the Asian chain rule because of

503
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,340
assumptions and have Germany

504
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:00,980
consequences on Finn's this is not a

505
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,919
meeting in every time here assumption or

506
00:32:00,980 --> 00:33:08,090
I assume in a composition

507
00:32:02,920 --> 00:33:11,840
that's a day that's not or is metrics

508
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:15,860
are specific to my organization and I

509
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,980
can look at them for your on them and

510
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:21,699
when to change tells me that's happening

511
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,710
they continue to do that

512
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:29,510
they need to be able to trust good

513
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:31,310
passes and those tests no matter what

514
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,290
security measures are going to tell you

515
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:36,610
cannot be generic

516
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:39,740
they can't security test of a meaningful

517
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:41,810
belong to the organization only I can't

518
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,210
define I made sure you get to check them

519
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:47,179
out this is about commas you that Frost

520
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,750
it's a I test you need testing framework

521
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,870
for AWS and you see

522
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,190
move except has a buzz of pets that

523
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,750
matter to us

524
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,700
and you can probably for Kate and what

525
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,590
if I hit the miniatures were to you but

526
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,570
if you run those desks right now maybe

527
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,870
someone that would be useful right the

528
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,919
testament of making sure we're

529
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,229
administrators have much effect Arras

530
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,060
that's probably useful for everybody but

531
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,750
this just here isn't useful to you

532
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:15,540
because this one checks the running ec2

533
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,820
instances and goes look for the base

534
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:24,120
image the airlines and make sure the

535
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:26,399
airlines are either by us neither both

536
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,500
owned by us and we're created in the

537
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:35,279
last 90 days that's how we check that

538
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:36,989
our money systems and that's the tested

539
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,700
specific to us because of the way we do

540
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:40,529
sync because we need immutable systems

541
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:44,120
because we do deployments in suits oil

542
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:46,770
etc this list tells us and helps us find

543
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,859
certain systems that are getting out of

544
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,580
it right and we trust that test and I

545
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,950
tell you what

546
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,949
because I didn't write it the operations

547
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,120
machine that update is terrible what's

548
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,589
going on and we know that the testing

549
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,720
realized it wasn't catching the right

550
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,550
thing but what you see we have in place

551
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,560
was incorrect and so we worked with your

552
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:13,290
precious Aemon they told us what they

553
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,560
consider to be an up-to-date instance

554
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:19,110
and it says encoded that intervening

555
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,960
that you need to be able to trust your

556
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:31,650
desk remember I think it was a too long

557
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:34,170
ago we met in the US wrong who said

558
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:39,690
we're seeing a lot of waves of cyber

559
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:43,550
attacks coming from Iran and what you

560
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,550
need yeah of course it was port scans

561
00:35:44,230 --> 00:36:17,140
okay you know what that tells me when I

562
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:19,959
hear this that you have no idea how

563
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,520
secure you are you have no idea you're

564
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,270
using the trip that doesn't make any

565
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,740
sense

566
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:27,430
and I never want to be in a situation

567
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,868
where executive comes to me and say what

568
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,490
is the state of your security and I

569
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:31,030
don't trust my testing my data that's

570
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,069
horrible

571
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,810
it makes us loop the counters to the

572
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:37,570
rest of the organization and to your

573
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,460
bridge system whereas now when I go to

574
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,940
your operations manager and I tell them

575
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,700
look I think we need to invest in fixing

576
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:48,310
a lot of the instances I can have a real

577
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,250
conversation because data is trustworthy

578
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:55,569
we define the test again and that's very

579
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:58,000
important the other part that means what

580
00:36:55,569 --> 00:37:03,609
it is setting the expectations a lot of

581
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,770
organizations if we go back to my you

582
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:07,569
just want to deploy a can and security

583
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,150
breach cells and then security says a

584
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:11,800
bunch of stuff that somebody knew about

585
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,740
of course you have to implement the

586
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,900
content security policy of the video and

587
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,549
the problem of Vantage is having what we

588
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,290
use that we weren't setting the

589
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,910
expectations early on we're telling

590
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:24,520
people when they're ready to deploy that

591
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:26,770
they need to do X Y Z and I would you

592
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,250
like five saw the nice echo of the same

593
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:32,109
write it so it's too late not doing

594
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,000
security at this stage so you need to

595
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:35,348
set the expectations very early on we

596
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,380
try to give you things I mentioned

597
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:39,580
obviously now the work with Simon

598
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,790
Valesky

599
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:45,560
that can we use that to prevent asking

600
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:48,650
for the baseline for web security

601
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,890
essentially we have a set of our

602
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,630
security measures for love the angles

603
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,370
that we want to have implemented

604
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,540
everywhere before we want something

605
00:37:55,370 --> 00:38:02,000
wrong and in that runs through the

606
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,130
actions that can convince us groups the

607
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,460
AIT was that could isn't you tell

608
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:10,250
developers to intercept an environment

609
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,410
to run a that's a application running

610
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:15,740
quite the package inductor indices or

611
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:18,500
weather and they love the SAP container

612
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,839
against replicating the table right away

613
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,600
as they were going through quest and

614
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,760
whatnot what headers are missing and

615
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,430
what needs to be amended before they

616
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,580
either emerged a to request or to voyage

617
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,290
reduction on several years to be same

618
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:37,640
you know some content security policy

619
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:40,750
and its take that right away the output

620
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,750
of the continuous integration

621
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:48,519
this didn't work and it was very

622
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,199
important that it would actually have a

623
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:51,129
one section in the book of that thing

624
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,170
this is great

625
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,759
it didn't work because I think was a

626
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:59,400
mix-up

627
00:38:54,759 --> 00:39:04,180
we're too deep in the integration of

628
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,699
what occasions that usually mess was it

629
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:17,788
was hard work to get there stay right

630
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:17,789
there exactly this and Ronnie and also

631
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:28,959
but we got something else out of this

632
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:31,180
that is really successful that is not

633
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:33,910
web security chip it's more than just

634
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:41,948
well it's actually anytime I want to

635
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:46,269
create a new service come to us you can

636
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:48,400
see a check

637
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:50,439
it's pretty long it's a bunch of stuff

638
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,539
that's specific to what we do internally

639
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:54,459
but all of it is will go industry

640
00:39:52,539 --> 00:40:00,509
standard it what's interesting about

641
00:39:54,459 --> 00:40:09,519
this is that I mentioned that we

642
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:13,269
infrastructure security this

643
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:15,519
intersection is what your security if

644
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:18,879
the navigation gets run on the core

645
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:21,600
infrastructure was called a road he

646
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,730
doesn't need all this

647
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,589
so that's a really strong incentive for

648
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:30,600
the property to not go to the highway

649
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:32,660
team to get a bunch of stuff free in the

650
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,830
checklist tell that from the get-go

651
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,290
before the right so much good you know

652
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:38,759
also season need to do not to be submit

653
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,980
any the first time they look at it that

654
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,140
I would have to spend two days but I

655
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,390
think but I threw this in it once or

656
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,870
twice it's quicker they realize it's not

657
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:53,400
that before adding in header nutrition

658
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:55,799
have loved the other thing that we

659
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:00,530
worked is giving the proper self

660
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:04,340
assessments to and that's of cementery

661
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:10,440
bring in your your psyche on there

662
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:12,030
integrate in tells you how and when it's

663
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,150
had passed it about lists with your

664
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:18,420
parent the security check mrs. Rieder

665
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:22,080
others who implement those rules right

666
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,820
and then check that you have the correct

667
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,890
amended treasure

668
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,260
and yes what they don't need to talk to

669
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,549
us they love this they don't want to

670
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,110
talk to us they want to do their own

671
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,240
thing they don't have security in two

672
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,780
seconds they do something security

673
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,859
related and what we found is that

674
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,500
development would be good at adopting

675
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,630
and getting to an East Coast grade

676
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,780
officer Snyder but even better than that

677
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:48,810
project managers when I need to their

678
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,330
readiness checklist that the site had to

679
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,980
get name plus before going to pro is

680
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:56,549
those be sitting in those meetings but

681
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,560
is this service ready for ease et cetera

682
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,170
was over directors

683
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,299
signing upon it and one of the intent

684
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,470
was yes all the security stuff is done

685
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,840
we're getting any person here for a

686
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:09,980
treatment oh and I wasn't even nobody

687
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,980
asked me a question did you

688
00:42:14,140 --> 00:43:19,160
is a lot of security teams are the new

689
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,570
team is changing the see changing the

690
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,660
CEO of people talking about doing this

691
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:29,420
so I still the case in all situations

692
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:31,009
I say no sometimes but is not and he's

693
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:33,580
what I think is happening my

694
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,580
interpretation

695
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,239
[Music]

696
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,050
[Music]

697
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:00,229
[Music]

698
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,410
they know how to appreciate risks much

699
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,570
better than I do I know what you've

700
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,890
spent mobile security risks but that

701
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:14,660
doesn't mean I know how much waste

702
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:17,359
organization shipment taken on the

703
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:20,060
initiative I don't have that visibility

704
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,310
I don't know if it's okay to lose three

705
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,940
million bucks on something on a

706
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:26,509
crapshoot

707
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:31,220
that's not my cause so I don't analyze

708
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:32,660
when I do security what I do is I eat we

709
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,430
even on something was good the rapid

710
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:38,098
risk assessment it's a Sunnah minute to

711
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:41,759
one hour conversation with product

712
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:43,799
as engineers before the beginning during

713
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:51,079
the design phase where we essentially

714
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:51,079
collected again they're doing through

715
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:39,650
this the decisions is to be strategic

716
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,880
about battleship so you can invest

717
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,880
