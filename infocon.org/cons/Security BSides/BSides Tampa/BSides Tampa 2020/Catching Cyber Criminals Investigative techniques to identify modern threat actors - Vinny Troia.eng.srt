1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
it

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,710
can you hear me back there so this talk

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,880
is called hunting cybercriminals

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:19,250
something that I knew talk I've been

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,038
putting together some information on

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,500
different threat actor groups how I came

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,570
about them and just some evidence that

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,640
we found along the way as through part

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:34,640
of the normal investigative process and

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,399
so with that my name is vini Troya I run

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,570
a company called Nightline security

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,690
typically my background in the past has

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,449
been mostly pen testing lately though I

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,159
say the past three years or so I've been

15
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:48,980
more on the threat Intel and

16
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,859
investigation side of things that's a

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,529
cover of my book hunting cyber criminals

18
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:57,589
which will be an extension of this talk

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,870
much more in-depth much more in-depth

20
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:03,679
stories actually will be out to some

21
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:10,810
first so please pick up a copy and with

22
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:10,810
that so

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,820
if I was going to convey just one thing

24
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:21,149
you do this entire talk it would be that

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,880
vanity Trump's OPSEC all the time say

26
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:25,850
you're nodding your head so you got it

27

28
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,449
this way perfect okay so I want to do a

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,830
little demonstration of exactly what

30
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,060
that means and we'll dig into it a

31
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,770
little bit more in a little bit but just

32

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:32,040
just wanted to post on my Instagram

47
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:35,070
become so alright so getting started for

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,350
real then so this this phrase definitely

49
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,720
is legit and we'll get into in a minute

50
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:44,730
but before we do that something I wanted

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:47,430
to talk about I would say I'm whenever I

52
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,489
call organizations to disclose something

53
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,440
that I found there are times where I

54
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,000
often get a lot of pushback and that's

55
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,190
because of some of the discoveries that

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,590
I've had in the media one of the more

57
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:03,090
prominent has been this company called

58
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:05,280
exactas so exact this was this marketing

59
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,890
firm that happened to have an open

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,720
elasticsearch database they leaked

61
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:14,850
information on like hundreds of millions

62
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:17,100
of US consumers I mean it was a massive

63
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,560
database that they leaked and so

64
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,480
typically in an instance like that I

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,120
mean I don't always go to the media in

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,980
this case we were having a lot of

67
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,050
trouble identifying where the data was

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,000
coming from which you know when you talk

69
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,270
about just have you know stumbling

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,130
across stuff on open buckets you know

71
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,870
usually points back to like an azure or

72
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,829
an AWS and you're never going to find

73
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,780
your owner that way

74
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:44,480
I mean Amazon certainly not going to

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,480
tell you who owns the bucket so

76
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,500
I had been working with a reporter at

77
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,930
the time and we kind of pieced it

78
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,879
together and you know the story came out

79
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,890
and when I had contacted exact this I

80
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,048
told them about it up front I said look

81
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,939
this is what's happening I've already

82
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,430
notified the FBI just because of the

83
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,810
volume of people that you know that

84
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,690
we're exposed in the amount of time that

85
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,829
the data was exposed and you know he

86
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,260
seemed okay he didn't to make a

87
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,480
statement and then the story came out

88
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,679
and then two weeks later he text me at

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,858
like 2:00 in the morning told me I

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,880
ruined his life it sucked but you know

91
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,380
at the end of the day I mean you really

92
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,949
should have a firewall in front of his

93
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:28,770
database but you know what happens but

94
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:32,160
but anyway so my point here is I don't

95
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,469
do a whole lot of public public database

96
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,169
disclosures like that but you know the

97
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:42,060
few that have been out certainly you

98
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:44,609
know you get this reputation and so to

99
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,970
put this in perspective there was

100
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,070
another breach that I came across rather

101
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,070
somebody was trying to sell me domain

102
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,990
admin credentials to a company now the

103
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,419
company never disclosed even though the

104
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,039
the people were actually ex filling the

105
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,990
data and I can't tell you who the major

106
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:04,460
airline is but you could probably piece

107
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,460
it together just by looking at this

108
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:11,810
so I contacted them and I said look

109
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,610
these guys are in your network they're

110
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,190
literally exfilling your data right now

111
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:20,810
and they're like now we don't think so

112
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:22,730
I'm like okay so a couple days later I

113
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,130
got back to them again I said look

114
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,540
really they're in your network yeah we

115
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,640
don't really believe you we think maybe

116
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,700
you're lying and this is like a trick is

117
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,650
it okay so I asked the guys for a sample

118
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,390
and so they gave me these commands that

119
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,700
they were running now obviously the

120
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,409
asterisks have been you know they were

121
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,510
removed but as it looked you know these

122
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,060
are commands that they're running as

123
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,650
domain admin in your network and

124
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,750
obviously these are your group members

125
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,940
and then I didn't hear from them anymore

126
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:57,740
and so two-three days went by and I was

127
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,840
calling him I'm like hey who's the

128
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,840
information good was the guy shit I mean

129
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,940
can you give me something and nothing so

130
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,330
finally he calls me back one night and

131
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,260
he's like look legal told me I'm not

132
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,380
allowed to talk to you anymore

133
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,419
like okay but the information was good

134
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,460
we got the guys out of the network but

135
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,049
we can't help you which really sucks

136
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,409
because the only thing I had asked for

137
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,790
going in was some IP addresses like

138
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,400
something that could maybe help me like

139
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,050
identify who these guys are

140
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,659
they wouldn't even do that which which

141
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,350
sucks but they kick the guys out and you

142
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,150
know the guys who were kinda doing this

143
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,580
kind of figured out it was me but not

144
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,020
really but it's it's it's one of those

145
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,969
annoying lines you kind of have to walk

146
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,580
where you know do I just say screw it

147
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,620
and let this day at I get exfilled or do

148
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,539
I notify them and have them out to be

149
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,760
big dicks but it happens but so

150
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,510
more often than not these are the types

151
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:59,480
of scenarios that I deal with usually

152
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:02,120
it's somebody who's already grabbed a

153
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,860
copy of the data and is looking for has

154
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,470
sort of a private market or private kind

155
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,500
of sales group going on or they're in

156
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,380
the middle of doing it I found that the

157
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,000
sale of domain admin accounts it's just

158
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,570
gone through the roof lately it seems

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,770
like that's all anybody's selling but so

160
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,840
let's talk about some of the groups that

161
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:25,340
I kind of running across a lot so the

162
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,250
first group and we'll only talk about

163
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:31,130
them briefly is magnet group madnes is a

164
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,880
group of Iranians they're on the FBI's

165
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:38,240
most wanted list they're most its most

166
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,110
well known for the Citrix hack they also

167
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:47,360
did HBO moto a bunch of others

168
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:48,830
and the guy who I was in direct

169
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,860
communication with I don't know who he

170
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,859
is

171
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,720
goes by Joker and so the thing that I

172
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,430
really love about doing this type of

173
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,620
threat Intel and really kind of digging

174
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,300
in and kind of talk to these guys is it

175
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,640
doesn't take much to set them off and

176
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,170
you can really like pin them against

177
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,700
each other which can be really fun to

178
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,140
watch and so I've got this one guy who's

179
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,340
you know everybody kind of tries to have

180
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,690
these pissing contests and they try to

181
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,429
one-up each other and you know what they

182
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,190
can do and so when you look at this

183
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,390
conversation I had with a guy about

184
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,969
Joker he was telling me you know about

185
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,280
Citrix and you know basically they got

186
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,750
the VPN credentials via cookies that

187
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,070
were stored on the Citrix server and

188
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,929
then citric said that they didn't get

189
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,740
hacked for all the products which is a

190
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,010
complete lie

191
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,780
and whoever disprove it you know

192
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,650
apparently these guys had access

193
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,970
internally for years I don't know but

194
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,160
this is the type of information that if

195
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,840
you start like poking and prodding comes

196
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,420
out very easily especially when people

197
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,890
kind of hate each other now this it

198
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,770
sucks that it's so hard to see on the

199
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,090
screen but this is specifically one of

200
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,819
madness tools

201
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:04,080
it's uh it's the most simplest thing

202
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:08,090
ever it's all it is a it's credential

203
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,530
stuffing so it you put in a company name

204
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,210
it will look through different data

205
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,980
breaches to find email addresses

206
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,720
associated with that company it'll find

207
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,090
the web server and it'll try just brute

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:23,700
force into the 365 login and that's it

209
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:27,660
so joker actually sold me or tried to

210
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,670
sell me komodo wanted it come out and so

211
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,670
that was good for them they notified

212
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,650
them but i mean this is i mean stuff

213
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,099
they do is all it just all it is is like

214
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,840
credentials 360 office 365 hacks stuff

215
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,650
like that so it's really not that

216
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,300
sophisticated but

217
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,810
and this is a little blurry but this is

218
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:55,120
a screenshot of folder he was selling on

219
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:55,119
here that Dow Jones back LexisNexis

220
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,350
Splunk so Splunk isn't as good as it

221
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,350
sounds

222
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,069
they were just kind of scraped from

223
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:09,240
different places and they were vetted

224
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,130
and they turned out to be legit but and

225
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,380
so this was early 2019 I lost track of

226
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,660
them interestingly enough after the

227
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,089
whole Citrix thing so since I know Joker

228
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,060
was the guy responsible for it kind of

229
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:23,850
disappeared and usually when people

230
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,449
disappear they like come back every once

231
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,519
in a while

232
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:30,589
Joker like disappeared so I think maybe

233
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,589
the Hilton which is unfortunately

234
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:38,589
but you know this is what it is

235
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:42,280
so another route that I deal with a lot

236
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,520
is NSFW now this is a list what I know

237
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:48,069
about that so NSFW is one to two people

238
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,680
and it's mostly one but sometimes it's

239
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:54,010
two it's weird but this is all the stuff

240
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:57,489
I know he's done and so I mean he's very

241
00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:04,180
busy the cool thing about NSFW is he

242
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:05,560
loves to talk and so high school all the

243
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,020
time you know how did you do this thing

244
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,270
or how did you do this and so here's one

245
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,640
it's a major online retailer this was

246
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,380
really interesting because he doesn't

247
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,699
use the same sort of low level hacks

248
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:21,640
that madnes does he's really into it so

249
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,350
this situation he had to wait five

250
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,000
months to hack it at a set of keys from

251
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,940
their storage AWS account that I got

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,950
from social engineering somebody from an

253
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,630
unused slack account ever even would

254
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,220
have thought about that basically I got

255
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,080
into the dev slack account that wasn't

256
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,790
being used a message to random sysadmin

257
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,960
who was active on a channel and asked

258
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,969
him for the keys to the new storage

259
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,770
environment he gave them to me in a text

260
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,890
file that I deleted it after I received

261
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,300
it I mean never would've thought of

262
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,270
trying to go in through slack but I

263
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,870
guess it works and you know I've ended

264
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,430
it with the company it's now very

265
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,150
thankful that we were able to kind of

266
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,020
figure this out

267
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:04,439
they have disclosed and this turned out

268
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:08,110
to be legit so it's it's good I like

269
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,450
more interactive little threatening hell

270
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,950
I guess I'm more of a hands-on kind of

271
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,080
person right I can't just sit back and

272
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,260
observe I like to kind of be deep in it

273
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,250
and here's another example major Las

274
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,740
Vegas hotel chain this one was actually

275
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,490
fairly complex I got to a point where I

276
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,490
didn't even understand what was going on

277
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,490
but

278
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,260
he identified software developers using

279
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,420
LinkedIn partially doxed one of them to

280
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,310
obtain some Gmail accounts performed

281
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,219
database lookups for password reuse

282
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,410
which always works then he got into the

283
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,410
guy's github and by the way sidetrack

284
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,670
one of his databases that I know he has

285
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,750
that he's just using the hell out of

286
00:12:52,670 --> 00:13:00,650
right now his code chef somebody should

287
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:03,020
probably notify them but so coach chefs

288
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,699
all developers and all he's doing is

289
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,220
he's cracking those password hashes and

290
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,890
he's going into github and he's finding

291
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,870
keys I mean that's like 90% of what he's

292
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:17,000
doing

293
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:20,210
so he got into Bob I changed the names

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,840
Bob github which was a reused password

295
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:26,180
from you know armor games and so I guess

296
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,950
github has this new algorithm to lock

297
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,989
out accounts from new IP so we had to

298
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,420
add in new public SSH key to the profile

299
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,840
then kind of got lucky because there was

300
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,550
this weird

301
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,980
octa implementation and I'm not a big

302
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,780
octave guy so I didn't really get it but

303
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:44,060
the company vetted it or validated it

304
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:45,890
and they were it was legit so the good

305
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,239
thing is he knows he has skill and he

306
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:51,260
loves to brag about it so that's

307
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,180
obviously good for me but you can always

308
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,120
kind of keep him talking and so I find

309
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,040
that Roche to be much much more

310
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,100
interesting and so the thing is why are

311
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,000
they up and this is a good question that

312
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,000
a lot of people ask me

313
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,500
however

314
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,350
in order to give you that answer I kind

315
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,310
of take a sidestep I won't talk about

316
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,019
these guys for a second to dark overlord

317
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,709
if you're not familiar with them in 2016

318
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:23,329
they came on the scene they basically

319
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:27,829
began terrorizing and extorting

320
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:30,560
organizations they had a huge media

321
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:34,459
presence initially from publicizing

322
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,790
hacks on medical facilities a bunch in

323
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:40,849
st. Louis or Missouri Midwest Imaging

324
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,949
Center Farmington sorry orthopedic spine

325
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:48,230
and clinic Ben Ness orthopedic there was

326
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:49,969
a bunch of in 2017 they kind of really

327
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,060
hit headlines when they hacked Netflix

328
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,970
they they were able to get advanced

329
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,560
copies of orange is the new black and so

330
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,980
I guess they extorted Netflix for like

331
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,729
fifty thousand dollars to not release it

332
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,399
which is weird cause I thought they

333
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:08,569
released it anyway but maybe Netflix

334
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,399
didn't pay them in see the end of 2017

335
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:13,310
there was a shift in the group that will

336
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,230
talk about it in a little bit but the

337
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,109
group moved from more traditional

338
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,089
hacking to more like terror based

339
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,850
attacks and by terror I mean that we're

340
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:26,060
literally sending like death threats to

341
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,529
students trying to get the schools to

342
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,149
pay the money in order to stop sending

343
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:35,329
text messages they actually closed 30 30

344
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:37,970
plus schools maybe 15,000 students

345
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:39,769
stayed home for over a week

346
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,709
the thing about the group is they're

347
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:44,029
extremely agitated all the time or at

348
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:48,680
least the front man is very very

349
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:51,350
agitated he loves talking he's got this

350
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,359
huge ego thing and if you challenge him

351
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,140
you'll push back immediately thinks he's

352
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,620
the greatest

353
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,880
[Music]

354
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,600
the really funny thing is like they

355
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,910
would always post stuff on Twitter and

356
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,490
like if if a company didn't like pay the

357
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:11,430
ransom they'd get really pissed on

358
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,100
Twitter who's just like really amateurs

359
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:20,959
we were like hey asshole why aren't you

360
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:22,790
paying the ransom like we can grow up so

361
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,100
so that was that

362
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:28,829
as far as attack vectors go they

363
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,400
initially did a bunch of RDP based

364
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,570
attacks they would buy so their initial

365
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,120
compromises they actually got from The

366
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,570
Ecstatic server ecstatic was an old dark

367
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,490
web forum where you can literally buy

368
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,250
RDP access to different servers I was

369
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,270
like five or ten bucks per server and we

370
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,140
know this to be fact is on those systems

371
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,740
ecstatic is actually nice enough to

372
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,790
provide their own client so you can

373
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,670
close the vulnerability but then get

374
00:16:53,790 --> 00:17:00,630
back in and so those were discovered on

375
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,709
a bunch of those machines what I think

376
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,090
happened and this is kind of

377
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,839
corroborated by a bunch of the articles

378
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:10,199
as well one of the medical clinics that

379
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,629
they had gained access to had this SRA s

380
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,860
medical software and from there they

381
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:21,689
found it's basically like a developer's

382
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:23,219
account kind of but he had call it a

383
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,780
developer will call it a dev account he

384
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,459
had access to other medical facilities

385
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,590
through she wasn't through the software

386
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,180
so from there their attacks just

387
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,399
ballooned out pages they used this as

388
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,570
their kind of method they had you know

389
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,950
they had access to all these other

390
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,179
facilities and then they went on this

391
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,750
ransoming rampage

392
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,650
[Music]

393
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,300
yesterday were able to identify stored

394
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,890
credentials within the clinic's medical

395
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,200
software which then gave them

396
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,790
third-party access to third-party remote

397
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,140
access the majority of all the future

398
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,830
medical victims

399
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,330
the company's completely ranged in size

400
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,059
it didn't really matter

401
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,250
although towards the end one of the guys

402
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:02,620
develops weird fetish where he would

403
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:05,950
like to go after like plastic surgery

404
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:11,949
plastic surgery clinics and release pre

405
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:13,179
and post-op rest like boob jobs thinking

406
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,039
that like if you're a Hollywood person

407
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:17,039
like you're gonna care it's wrong line

408
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,209
but he would get really really angry

409
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,649
about it I was actually kind of fun to

410
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,330
watch so I also think towards the end

411
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,709
they you know the value of Bitcoin

412
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,870
dropped it weren't really making a whole

413
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,380
lot of money and so they were really

414
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,639
kind of grasping at straws but yeah so

415
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,840
the majority of their initial victims

416
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:42,969
were all RDP access is very

417
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,590
unsophisticated low level I mean I mean

418
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,779
they they literally bought the access

419
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,070
and then once they were in they were you

420
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:51,580
know they were able to use this software

421
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,629
to kind of tunnel out when communicating

422
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,629
with the group

423
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,240
this is the most impressive thing I

424
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,030
think about this group is that

425
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,470
everything they did was standardized so

426
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,990
regardless of who you were talking to

427
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,950
which you know which group member they

428
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,299
had called a script they had basically

429
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,370
everything was standardized against the

430
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,809
Queen's English so it only appeared that

431
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,449
you were talking to the same person even

432
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:19,580
though you I mean obviously there's

433
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:24,110
differences and hell no certainly

434
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:26,830
charitable but I was looking into this

435
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:29,059
and there's like so for Jabbar clients

436
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:32,570
pidgin if you guys know you're pigeon

437
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:33,830
but pigeon actually has autocorrect kind

438
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,149
of like an autocorrect script where you

439
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,350
could literally like putting your own

440
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:40,549
language so you just do normal talk the

441
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,469
way you talk and have it kind of

442
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,789
autocorrect for your tech school really

443
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:50,150
interesting that they would take the

444
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:51,559
time to do that but in 2017 I was kind

445
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,320
of alluding for this they had a public

446
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,399
announcement on Twitter that said there

447
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,580
was going to be an official change of

448
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:02,299
leadership now I call this kind of tea

449
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,939
do one in tea do to the leadership

450
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:07,570
change marked the beginning of all the

451
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,039
increased hostility and aggressiveness

452
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:15,370
and basically again moving away from

453
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:16,908
more traditional hacking more aggressive

454
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,799
manipulation

455
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,960
you know just hostile for us things like

456
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,789
that

457
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,159
[Music]

458
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:27,710
so I hate that I have to redact this but

459
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:30,830
I do but here is kind of the basic

460
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:34,609
overview of the group so there's four is

461
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,408
four keeps working people cipher we'll

462
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:39,340
talk about him he's kind of the guy in

463
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:42,080
the background he's never really visible

464
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:45,109
he's mostly well known for running the

465
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,840
kick-ass forum indeed black box form as

466
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:49,309
the name NSA not to be confused with the

467
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,009
NSA on here

468
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:53,509
Arnie whose most well known as the

469
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:56,210
group's leader was actually their fall

470
00:20:53,509 --> 00:21:01,519
guy which talk about NSA is the guy

471
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:03,619
really aggressive kid who very angry all

472
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,149
the time he does a lot of the hacking

473
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,809
and then crook is kind of their sales

474
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:07,809
and marketing guy

475
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:16,780
here is a list of victims like mine

476
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,310
published I know there's more I know a

477
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,610
lot of people haven't come forward these

478
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,260
were the one and also just to be clear

479
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,270
it's not to say that all of these people

480
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,070
have paid a ransom just all of these

481
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,720
people have at least been contacted or

482
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,720
terrorized by this group in some way

483
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,190
[Music]

484
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:42,640
interestingly enough it was one night

485
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,590
maybe October it was like midnight on a

486
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,560
Friday he decided to call me not like

487
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:50,500
call me on the phone he like jabbered me

488
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:53,320
and so I don't think actually he was

489
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,580
drunk and so we literally talked like

490
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,929
three and a half hours and it was the

491
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,639
weirdest conversation I've ever had with

492
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:02,260
anybody a lot of those snippets and

493
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,970
conversations will be in my book and my

494
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,129
official report and when all the

495
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:10,750
indictments come out but I wanted to

496
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:16,210
kind of break out this section here he's

497
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:17,890
really focused on the school closings I

498
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,540
mean he talks about it all the time he

499
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,040
won't shut up about it

500
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,200
and you also won't shut up about the

501
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,340
fact that the CIA and the NSA like keep

502
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,870
trying to go after him and they're

503
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,340
unsuccessful and he thinks he's like all

504
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,169
that but so here it's been publicly

505
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:37,899
reported check the billings is that in

506
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:39,430
Montana okay you realize that we closed

507
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,710
down six different school districts in

508
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:44,020
Montana for five business days 36,000

509
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,820
students we've all heard about bomb

510
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,190
threats but have you known anyone to

511
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:54,460
close down schools five days thought

512
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:56,650
about it well no okay I haven't he's

513
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,840
just he's so proud of it I don't know I

514
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,250
mean okay you close I mean granted yes

515
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,770
it's an accomplishment to close the

516
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:07,080
school and at 35,000 kids out of school

517
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,080
for five days but congratulations

518
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:16,990
so I've asked him many times like what

519
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:19,030
is most impressive hack is and not he

520
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,770
always comes back to this and sometimes

521
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,879
especially towards the end I was doing

522
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,260
it just to kind of get a rise out of

523
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:28,210
them but okay so kind of back to this

524
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,030
why are they talking so now that we kind

525
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,940
of have a general idea of who the TD o

526
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:38,770
players are I wanted to bring up this

527
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:41,410
situation mr. Brian Arabs wrote the most

528
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,230
awesomely bashing article about me

529
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,770
calling me a criminal

530
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:50,320
not long ago maybe five six months ago

531
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:52,750
basically the story was when security

532
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,280
researchers disguised themselves as

533
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,590
cyber criminals who can tell the

534
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,270
difference frankly kinda thought that

535
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:02,740
was the point of disguising myself as a

536
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:05,470
criminal but it's okay he was in an

537
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,360
uproar about something I don't know but

538
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:11,140
basically he accused me of selling fake

539
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,510
data online which is true I was selling

540
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,390
fake data online

541
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,820
[Music]

542
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:21,140
I mean I was doing it to kind of get in

543
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,939
with a cyber those groups of people but

544
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:26,220
it is what it is I mean he he didn't

545
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,450
appreciate the fact that his name was in

546
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,140
the sample even though all the

547
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,800
information was stripped out of it and

548
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,990
it is what it is

549
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,730
but anyway so he wrote this article and

550
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,260
it kind of sent this ripple through the

551
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,960
kick-ass forum and so if you're not

552
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:43,910
familiar with kick-ass kick-ass was it

553
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,650
no longer is a dark web hacker forum

554
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:49,320
it's it was one of the few remaining

555
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:55,230
there aren't many left that are really

556
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:57,090
used anymore that being said it it kind

557
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,350
of had this little ripple effect and so

558
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,610
he even replied here at the bottom

559
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,250
because he told me that you were kicked

560
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:04,080
from kick-ass for insulting tdo which

561
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,380
was kind of true so you know what did he

562
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,110
burn well thing is you may not realize

563
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,750
is that it pissed everybody in the form

564
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:15,360
off once they knew I was there and so

565
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,800
we've got this guy def ro who's yes this

566
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,209
is my real social security number or

567
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,760
date of birth and everything else and

568
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:24,450
you know he's trying to start this whole

569
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:28,410
campaign against me and then the the

570
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:32,130
form admin NSA cyber decides to put a

571
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:35,580
bounty on my website which is it was

572
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,640
annoying but so he had this contest now

573
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:43,310
if who can hack Vinnie Troy his website

574
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:45,510
so my motto is go big or go home

575
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:49,080
you know who can hack Benny Choi his

576
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:52,820
website I can so using one of my other

577
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,820
aliases I hacked my own website

578
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,929
thank you so this was my website this

579
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,559
was the about me page

580
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:09,590
I had this up I was using the name argon

581
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,269
at the time and so here's the thing

582
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,908
Brian's article was a pain in the ass

583
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:16,190
but I had this really good opportunity

584
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:18,830
now because I was already trying to get

585
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,769
into ciphers a little like exclusive

586
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:26,779
hacking group and now I did this major

587
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:28,039
hack that he was so impressed with but

588
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:34,730
of course he was going to want to know

589
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:35,750
more right yeah well this thinks so I

590
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,080
mean of course he's going to want to

591
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,909
know more so this is I thought it was a

592
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,860
great opportunity to set a trap and and

593
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:46,720
to learn some information so what I did

594
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,129
was set up a fake PHP my admin panel

595
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,990
picked an obscure folder easily

596
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,639
discoverable with der Buster I you know

597
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,460
gave it tennis implausibility of how I

598
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:57,350
found it it was an old outdated version

599
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,389
that I knew had some vulnerabilities but

600
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,600
I took an old one of my passwords that I

601
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:04,610
found in another data breach and I said

602
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,469
that as the password and then I said

603
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,840
have some strict firewall rules to block

604
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,220
any tor VPN or known bad IP addresses

605
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,539
once they started connecting I'd

606
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,870
actually get a pretty clear view of

607
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:16,100
where they were coming from and I let it

608
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:20,750
fly

609
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,639
I got five solid hits out of that that's

610
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,880
it I got five hits I mean that was was

611
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:30,229
great they were all good a lot of them

612
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,820
came from Amazon Amazon accounts which I

613
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,470
couldn't do anything with but I'm sure

614
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,289
law enforcement figured some stuff out

615
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,750
with that but Amazon won't obviously

616
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:42,470
they won't tell me who owns the IPS but

617
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:45,470
I mean those were I mean they fell for

618
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:49,039
it was great and you know I got into his

619
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:52,730
little Club and everything was peachy so

620
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,740
access was granted sort of the reality

621
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,210
is it's a little more convoluted than

622
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:00,200
that but for the most part that's kind

623
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:02,870
of how it went but so you know kind of I

624
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,090
was listening to you know strand talk

625
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,570
here yesterday about kind of setting up

626
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,279
these traps of you know what

627
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,559
build these attackers run on and this

628
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:12,450
was a perfect situation where I mean

629
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,250
there's no way they weren't going to try

630
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,509
to login to that panel and I know they

631
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,360
logged in because they were actually

632
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:20,220
posting copies of hashes from within the

633
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,080
PHP my admin page trying to get them to

634
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,600
you know looking for people to crack

635
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,960
them so I know who's in the page

636
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,039
specifically and now I have a pretty

637
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,799
good idea where he is

638
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,179
delarue's so it worked out so like I

639
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,740
said go big or go home I mean I don't

640
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:45,090
think most people would have like gone

641
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:47,290
to those lengths but all great so moving

642
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,299
on then

643
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,980
where to start I mean assuming we're

644
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:56,320
kind of starting at the beginning of

645
00:28:50,980 --> 00:29:02,410
this thing when you know aunty do first

646
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:04,750
came out they were very they were all

647
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:07,900
over the media for though she was there

648
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,840
uh health care hacking

649
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:15,240
and

650
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:18,240
okay so be this long the two big players

651
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,150
that we saw this guy Arnie who was

652
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,190
posting stuff on hell he was the guy who

653
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,840
initially posted access to the RDP

654
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,000
access to medical groups and all the

655
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,340
stuff he was selling and then we had

656
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,870
this other guy crook who was also

657
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,820
posting all of the sales information

658
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:37,320
most notably he had this jabber account

659
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,679
that he always used crooked switch

660
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,590
jabber

661
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,150
he would post on a lot of the Russian

662
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,020
forums and he was he was the sales guy

663
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,020
it was very obvious

664
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:51,580
so the thing about crook sorry the thing

665
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,640
about crook is he was incredibly smart

666
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:57,730
because he as a person will only reuse

667
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,280
handles that other people are using and

668
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,690
I'll show you why that's significant

669
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,160
here in a minute but before we get into

670
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:07,090
crook I actually want to get an Arnie

671
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,770
his are name for a long time was like

672
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,820
the biggest mystery ever everybody is

673
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,730
trying to figure out who our knee was

674
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,409
and when it finally like dawned on me

675
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,430
after I read the official like

676
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:24,340
indictments like I was smacking myself

677
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:26,280
but so in 2016 2017 this wonderful man

678
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,780
Nathan Wyatt was arrested for hacking

679
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,660
Pippa Middleton's iPhone account and

680
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,350
some other stuff he goes by the name

681
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,130
crap Deepak nee yeah he was arrested in

682
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,169
2016

683
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:41,110
suspicion of computer misuse Act

684
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:43,990
offences for sale of pictures from Pippa

685
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,620
Middleton's iPhone following a search of

686
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,180
his devices the London police found

687
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,629
malware that he was using to gain access

688
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:55,860
to different law firms that were also

689
00:30:52,630 --> 00:31:02,980
associated with specifically with T do

690
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:05,169
the funny thing about him is that he set

691
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,450
up bank accounts in his personal name

692
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:10,150
and his girlfriend's name to extract

693
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:14,140
funds received from TD OHS extortions

694
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:16,930
his real name and his girlfriend's real

695
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,020
name so they really found a winner with

696
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,510
him

697
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,370
so that's why I say he's their fall guy

698
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:25,059
he was Arnie he was the front guy he's

699
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:28,279
the who's the one you only spoke with

700
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:31,428
his alias is crappy cockney mask Jason

701
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,789
Voorhees ginger Vitus loot 5 dark money

702
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:38,090
man

703
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:40,039
alright currently mr. Arne is fighting

704
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:44,720
extradition to the US now there's an

705
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:46,490
article that was published earlier this

706
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,230
year there's a UK magazine that

707
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,169
basically lists all of the charges in

708
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:53,779
the UK and when you read them all I mean

709
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:55,490
it points it all out I mean the FBI is

710
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,789
charging him with all the army stuff and

711
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:00,640
I mean it just makes sense it works out

712
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:03,169
they seized his devices they found the

713
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,820
all the tedious stuff he was the one

714
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:06,710
kind of registering all the accounts I

715
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,439
mean he was literally doing all of the

716
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:13,279
stuff that you could get caught for and

717
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:16,720
he was giant douche bag I mean that is

718
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:20,659
isn't that just the best picture and in

719
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:24,590
his extreme douchiness he decided to

720
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:32,380
call somebody a law firm and recorded

721
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:35,510
the message and put it on YouTube he ran

722
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,700

737
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:15,399
mean he really had the whole like

738
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:20,350
anonymity thing covered

739
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,940
so yeah I mean this picture I love this

740
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:25,139
picture I mean the kid I don't even know

741
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:29,080
if the kids like alive on this picture

742
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,660
but anyway so that was Arnie so no big

743
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,320
mystery there he was that he was the he

744
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,670
was the front guy and whatever they had

745
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,950
him do all the stuff that they didn't

746
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,850
want to do themselves which was very

747
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,809
smart actually

748
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,809
alright so crook

749
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:50,060
so crook just to give you a little

750
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,320
spoiler alert Clark is NSFW the guy that

751
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,720
I showed you earlier with all the other

752
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:59,570
stuff now so crook was the one posting

753
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:02,720
all of the RDP access sale stuff he used

754
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:06,409
on all the forums whatever else the

755
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,560
reason why his choosing of names is so

756
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,940
just brilliant his other name that he

757
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,880
was using at the time was Fetty WAP

758
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,750
who's a rapper so whenever you search

759
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:19,100
for him you come up with a bunch of crap

760
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,980
the thing about crook is there's a few

761
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:27,920
other Carter's using the name crook most

762
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:30,080
notably all roads lead to this man he

763
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:34,400
also happens to be shy well he's

764
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:36,500
obviously a giant pothead but he is he's

765
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,620
a Carter I mean it's very obvious I mean

766
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,050
he's very open about it actually he uses

767
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,670
the name crow and so a lot of the

768
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,790
security reports will all talk about

769
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:49,580
this man in Saskatchewan who's really

770
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,830
crooked yeah that's him it's not him I

771
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:57,910
mean yes I think I thought he is crook

772
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:57,910
he's just not tdos crook so

773
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,740
the great thing about looking for these

774
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,990
guys like when you start to find them

775
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,299
just like with you know anyone in the

776
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:16,089
industry I mean they all reuse their

777
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,090
passwords it's it's so dumb

778
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,200
if you have the right data sets you can

779
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,600
start to look for passwords in his case

780
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,660
his past was 7 8 6 1 1 0 I don't know

781
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,940
why that's burned in my head but it is

782
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,740
and so that's a fairly unique password

783
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,250
it had something to do with his Islam I

784
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,689
don't remember what it was but so you

785
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,030
start to look up other people with

786
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,620
passwords 7 8 6 1 1 0 and you find other

787
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,650
accounts that are associated you kind of

788
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,730
move down the chain the problem is

789
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,020
actually and this is when I was working

790
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,550
with prevalent perhaps made this

791
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,930
beautiful little map of all the

792
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,150
different accounts we found where we

793
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:55,020
found them what was going on the issue

794
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:57,000
was none of it as great as it was would

795
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,850
ever link back to this Swiss jabber

796
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,400
account and the Swiss jabber account was

797
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:07,020
tedious pro so there was a gap and you

798
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,070
know eventually we figured out that

799
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,720
obviously it wasn't the right guy but so

800
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:16,410
I was stuck on this part for a long time

801
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,209
and I was trying to find the answer with

802
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,730
a lot of different thread Intel tools I

803
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,040
literally tried them all none of them

804
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,620
have what I needed so I just built my

805
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,480
own call it data VIPRE it's not

806
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,750
commercially available maybe it will be

807
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,890
one day but basically what I did was I

808
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,920
needed historical data

809
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:37,950
I needed data dumps I needed forums I

810
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,720
needed everything so I had access to all

811
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,629
these you know private data sets from

812
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,299
the guys who were literally dumping them

813
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:47,580
so that was easy and I mean I've tried

814
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,580
other I tried recorded future I did try

815
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,890
to Intel 471 for IQ spy cloud none of

816
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,840
them had all of the pieces necessary and

817
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,730
actually I got to be honest some of them

818
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,270
were really rude like when I asked them

819
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,520
for help

820
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,950
one of them actually literally told me

821
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,790
to fuck off

822
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:05,480
and I had friends who had access to

823
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,790
their system

824
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,220
who would like run the queries for me

825
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,930
and it occurred to me that the reason

826
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,629
they were so rude about it is because

827
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:16,609
their product fucking suck I mean they

828
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,140
had no data to begin with and I just

829
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:21,290
don't think they wanted to like show

830
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,240
that show that all so anyway so I

831
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:26,050
started building all these different

832
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,060
like scrapers to run across forums and

833
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,619
terabytes of data now and so I've got

834
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:35,570
this all in this elasticsearch database

835
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:39,260
which is protected by firewall and it's

836
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:40,970
it's been great so the cool thing is so

837
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,280
this is data VIPRE the cool thing is it

838
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,230
allows me to I can do all the sorting I

839
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,480
can kind of run all these queries the

840
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,570
way I want um but the important thing is

841
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,000
I can see all of the person's posts in a

842
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:55,520
row right and so when you start to kind

843
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,640
of break it down by time there's a much

844
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:03,980
clearer picture that's all right and

845
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,700
I'll show you what I found so March 29

846
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,190
or March 29 2016 crook post on kick-ass

847
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,379
forum that he's selling carding mafia

848
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,780
army force online team ski which is like

849
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,390
this big porn Network which I'm sure

850
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,839
none of you know anything about and some

851
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:25,069
other stuff again crooked switch jabber

852
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:27,680
fine a couple days later team skeet goes

853
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:31,270
up for sale on dream market by someone

854
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:37,940
named neo boss literally one day later

855
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:41,329
there's an article published on I don't

856
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,190
know somewhere where hackers selling a

857
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:46,460
data under the handle neo bosses gain

858
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:48,050
control of the site team ski fine you

859
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,690
could make it a sum you can make an

860
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:53,960
assumption that this is crook until you

861
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,369
see this post or he's clearly pissed

862
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,960
that his partner went to the press and

863
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:59,150
took credit for

864
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,069
so we know that it wasn't crook that

865
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,290
whoever he was working with got the data

866
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:07,970
it went to the press claimed it and now

867
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:10,369
it's public about a month later there's

868
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:13,730
a Ripper report filed on exploit from

869
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:17,050
crook to someone named worm worm is a

870
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,770
very very well known scammer

871
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,869
incidentally enough or interestingly

872
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:23,390
enough he filed the same Ripper report

873
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,950
on a form called siphon under the name

874
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:30,160
fatty WAP so that was an instant

875
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:33,430
connection then

876
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,618
October this article comes out hacker

877
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,440
linked to MySpace LinkedIn dumps tax

878
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:40,569
competitor piece made his name selling

879
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,279
database dumps of silicon valley's has

880
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:48,579
dumped apparent data of rival

881
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:51,240
black-market site okay this is why I

882
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:54,270
love when they fight

883
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,930
so not only did he hack the site but he

884
00:39:54,270 --> 00:40:01,920
dumped the database so analyzing the

885
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:06,810
database popping it into data VIPRE we

886
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,250
see this little insert statement now so

887
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,380
I have all these scripts running in data

888
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,930
bite but that will pull out the sequel

889
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,040
statements and kind of whatever put it

890
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,040
into a format that I can search

891
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:23,340
in this form announcement which

892
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:26,550
technically isn't a forum post it's just

893
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:28,680
an announcement so easy to miss but worm

894
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,860
is under new management payment and info

895
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,319
sent to ke7 HP at worm that ws doesn't

896
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:39,960
meaning right just worm is on their new

897
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:42,060
manage fine data Viper for the win if we

898
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,210
look at the insert statements we can see

899
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:48,410
that username ke 7hb has now been

900
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:50,850
changed to Brooke at switch jabber at CH

901
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,770
so going back to our previous article

902
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:55,049
where peace of mind literally went to

903
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:57,540
the press and said he hacked worm site

904
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:03,420
you can see right here that peace of

905
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:06,060
mind is crooked Swiss Jeb and now that I

906
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,790
kind of figured that out going back over

907
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:12,810
the logs and looking back to May of 2016

908
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:14,850
in vanity over OPSEC he fucking posted

909
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,779
it said worm is under new management I

910
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:20,700
wonder who it could be

911
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:22,200
geez so that mystery was solved so now

912
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,629
we know who cookies Brooke is the Scott

913
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,890
peace of mind now peace of mind is

914
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:30,840
really well known for linkedin myspace

915
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,069
vk.com there's so many I don't think he

916
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,880
hacked them I think he was just more of

917
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,880
a broker um

918
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,170
the peace of mind is also well known as

919
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,790
ping the owner of the original hell

920
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,590
forum and there was a whole there's so

921
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:46,170
much news about him in 2016 when the

922
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:48,000
forum's were raided and they had this

923
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,820
whole like fake Docs that they tried to

924
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,020
like pass over on the police and hoping

925
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,430
that they would believe that he wasn't

926
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:58,650
some 15 year old even though he is so

927
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:02,460
here's some other aliases frosty he's

928
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:04,740
also NSFW Orion cat6 X which he uses as

929
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,140
T do and many many many more which will

930
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:12,450
be in my official report which would be

931
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:15,740
out any day now waiting for those

932
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,740
arrests to happen so

933
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:24,569
yes oh they raided his place they they

934
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:27,870
found the form called ping SEC that was

935
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:30,060
pretty obvious clue that he was the real

936
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:32,220
ping but obviously he was a minor at the

937
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,470
time so that kind of got thrown out but

938
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,750
kind of based on all this we know

939
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,450
exactly who he is now and like the

940
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:42,870
really important thing but double sorry

941
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:46,290
about that is that now that I know who

942
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:47,970
he is it's like just an open day to

943
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,440
identifying the rest of TTL because all

944
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:51,870
you got to do now is figure out okay who

945
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,820
is this kid associated with who was he

946
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,650
friends with on health form how did you

947
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,630
meet because you didn't just randomly

948
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:01,560
meet other members of PDL right I mean

949
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:03,210
these are his boys and it turns out the

950
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,080
other member of tdo who unfortunately

951
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:09,720
talked about today

952
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:12,210
they live five miles from each other 30

953
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:16,020
year apart in age I mean couldn't get

954
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:20,010
any easier so he was also admin of the

955
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:22,980
real deal dark web market and it's the W

956
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:25,620
and Gnostic players they're all over the

957
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,060
news now Gnostic boys this is all the

958
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:31,770
stuff that they've openly admitted to

959
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:33,240
doing they are very busy so any of the

960
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,690
like data dumps that are floating around

961
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,348
now

962
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:40,029
is probably coming from him now he's not

963
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,700
the driving force and Gnostic players as

964
00:43:40,029 --> 00:43:46,019
a few guys but I know he's helping so

965
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,019
I mean you take all this stuff

966
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:52,630
MyFitnessPal my heritage there's so much

967
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:55,059
here check armor games eight tracks and

968
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,599
you combine that with all of his other

969
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:57,549
stuff

970
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:02,109
I mean he's I don't know how he does

971
00:43:57,549 --> 00:44:06,779
anything else but actually he does have

972
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:06,779
a day job it's not an IT but so

973
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,710
so we have look at known associates

974
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:15,730
right and so once I started running out

975
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,490
of time

976
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:21,340
so once I figure out who his associates

977
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,950
were that led me right to NSA at rosio

978
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,030
whose t do - who's the current like

979
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:28,868
figurehead the really aggressive

980
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:30,640
douchebag of the dark overlord and cyber

981
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:32,470
cyber I want to talk about cyber was

982
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,319
kind of like the who the man in the

983
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:38,980
background so cyber is I'd say mid 40s

984
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,040
excellent programmer

985
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:44,440
I think he's backgrounds like C++ also

986
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,540
he goes by NSA him and NSA kind of

987
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,260
swapped the Aces at one point also goes

988
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:52,029
by Cybertron look ghost scene on he was

989
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,460
the admin of kick-ass form and also the

990
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:56,830
admin of black box form and he was in an

991
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:00,150
old hacking group in the 90s also the

992
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:02,619
giveaway of his age called hack wiser I

993
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:04,290
know this to be true cuz he won't shut

994
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:07,240
up about it

995
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,410
you can track his aliases on different

996
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,089
forums cuz that's the first thing he

997
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,859
says I was member of hack wiser and

998
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:13,859
what's not even right English so

999
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,549
as part of all the data I was collecting

1000
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:21,579
for data VIPRE there's there was an old

1001
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:24,369
forum called galaxy 2 and it's basically

1002
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:25,719
like a tour based social media and I

1003
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:29,680
guess this is a place that people just

1004
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:32,079
go and like troll each other and so

1005
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,450
there was a heated flame war on galaxy 2

1006
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,880
and I'm not going to read all this but

1007
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,828
Cybertron which is cyber and sky arson

1008
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,529
tech our syntax are always going back

1009
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:43,359
and forth about how cyber wants to start

1010
00:45:41,529 --> 00:45:45,700
this forum called black box no black box

1011
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,180
is stupid name no your skid blah blah

1012
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:51,038
it's all very riveting um but then

1013
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,529
there's this this is just great

1014
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:57,099
so sugar time rule of hidden services

1015
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:59,200
never speak your real IP telnet cipher

1016
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:02,859
okay so black box URL literally had the

1017
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,848
name cyber in it which also oh and look

1018
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:09,190
at that

1019
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:11,109
KS 355 296 Kim Sufi calm oh and is that

1020
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:15,430
his IP address for the black box server

1021
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:16,690
I think it is 91 121 120 49 it just

1022
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:21,549
happened to be open somebody caught it

1023
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:23,079
and posted it so that's why I love the

1024
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:24,400
power of historical data because it's

1025
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,739
all there if you can go back far enough

1026
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,299
you'll find where these kids are just

1027
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:31,509
being assholes and they just out each

1028
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:34,869
other and it's all right there and so

1029
00:46:31,509 --> 00:46:38,289
I'm gonna one one thing before I leave

1030
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:40,050
you going back to this tack lies within

1031
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:43,800
this is

1032
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:45,240
I love this so okay so cyber all he

1033
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,310
talks about is being in hack wiser it's

1034
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,209
like his I don't know it's his Grammy

1035
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:50,210
whatever you want to call it

1036
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,000
on galaxy 2 he posted this message

1037
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,560
here's something for you to read here's

1038
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,050
the hack Weiser article and then our

1039
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,880
syntax lists the members which includes

1040
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:05,980
cybertron blah blah blah and he's

1041
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:08,690
laughing okay now when i read this

1042
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,380
he took me a few minutes but then i

1043
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:11,510
thought about it

1044
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,390
I've seen the hack wise word page so

1045
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:15,730
many times

1046
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:20,879
and not once did I ever remember seeing

1047
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,880
Cybertron and so here's the current

1048
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:25,290
earn hack Weiser page right it lists all

1049
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:29,150
these members that historical members

1050
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,150
doesn't say cipher anywhere on

1051
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:37,399
and this is when I found out how amazing

1052
00:47:32,479 --> 00:47:42,098
Wikipedia actually is so Wikipedia keeps

1053
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:45,589
records of every edit ever made ever and

1054
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:47,630
in this just beautiful move cipher

1055
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:50,029
needed to immoral immortalize himself

1056
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:52,130
and so over here on the left you see the

1057
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:53,869
original member list and over here on

1058
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:56,119
the right we see the addition of

1059
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:58,099
Cybertron now if you're going to post

1060
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,869
something anonymously on Wikipedia you

1061
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:04,099
probably don't want to do it from VPN or

1062
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:08,930
tor address there's a Republican flag

1063
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:13,489
so where are you gonna do it from home

1064
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:15,649
IP address yeah so doing a quick trace

1065
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:18,319
came back to Austria which I already

1066
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,920
knew he was in so I mean this guy is so

1067
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,469
stupid

1068
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,809
that he had to put this zone name in

1069
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:28,699
Wikipedia use his own IP address and

1070
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:30,469
it's just right there so that's the kind

1071
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:32,269
of stuff I love doing like this type of

1072
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:34,249
investigative work it's it's very

1073
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:36,649
different from a lot of the threat Intel

1074
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:39,979
that's being done and you know one of

1075
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:41,959
the reasons I decided to not publish my

1076
00:48:39,979 --> 00:48:43,669
tool is because I think it is such a

1077
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:44,959
specific thing that I don't know how

1078
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,969
many people would actually get good use

1079
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:48,890
out of it unless you're a sock that's

1080
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:52,940
really looking for that kind of stuff so

1081
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:55,759
for now it's just kind of my thing but

1082
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,769
that's kind of where I'm at so we

1083
00:48:55,759 --> 00:49:00,259
covered cyber we covered crook which

1084
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:01,578
were the two of the three main and we

1085
00:49:00,259 --> 00:49:04,279
covered Arnie so we covered three of the

1086
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:07,489
four main members of T do the last one I

1087
00:49:04,279 --> 00:49:10,549
actually can't talk about yet but very

1088
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:11,839
very soon hopefully we'd like to say at

1089
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:16,579
the next Derby con but at the next

1090
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:20,640
somewhere so with that we're right on

1091
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:23,520
time thanks for coming

1092
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,520
[Applause]
