hacker and a researcher I've been in

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,330
this space doing this for 15 years I've

26
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,979
actually been a hacker a lot longer than

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,860
that I always tell the story really

28
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,289
quick that at you know the age of 12 I

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,549
bought my first computer so for those of

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,750
you remember 1989 yeah I'm that old

31
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:37,920
you know we didn't have computers in

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,150
homes typically so yeah I went out and

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,600
bought my first computer taught myself

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,520
how to program in basic and later taught

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,240
myself asynchronous modem communications

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,720
did some things to prodigy that may or

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,899
may not be beyond the statute of

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,539
limitations for the Computer Fraud and

39
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,360
Abuse Act I'm really not sure so we'll

40
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,689
just leave it at that

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,810
as was mentioned I work for sneek so we

42
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,549
do application security software for

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,739
developers and I say for developers I

44
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,480
mean like we write stuff for developers

45
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,460
to use it's not stuff for security

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,390
people security

47
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,090
people use it too I'm also author and a

48
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,049
blogger I'm currently working on a book

49
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,910
for those of you that actually heard my

50
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,140
question for Rachel this morning that

51
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,560
was related to the book I'm writing

52
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:31,339
trying to find ways to get more people

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,840
into our industry and help advocate for

54
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,780
them help them understand how to get

55
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,300
around things like you know the HR

56
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,910
firewall and so forth and then finally

57
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,280
I'm also the co-host of the uncommon

58
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,359
journey podcast and itsp magazine we

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,340
just launched that a couple weeks ago so

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,780
today I'm taking you on a journey it's a

61
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,400
journey of sight and sound and you'll

62
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,840
have really cool sound today we're

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,800
hooked up with the headsets you know we

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:05,330
use our five senses to evaluate our

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,930
world around us but what happens when

66
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,530
suddenly those senses become the attack

67
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,320
vector that the cyber criminals the

68
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,880
attackers are using against us so let me

69
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,880
tell you a really quick story when I was

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,170
four years old my parents took me to

71
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,940
this place those of you from the Midwest

72
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,869
will recognize that the Wisconsin Dells

73
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:29,600
and yes I got one thumbs up somebody's

74
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,320
from that area love it it's cold up

75
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,820
there colder than this you know we went

76
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,840
to this place and we do a lot of stuff

77
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,160
you know they got water parks and

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
everything else but one of the things we

79
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,200
did was went to the place they call a

80
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,119
fun house now I don't understand why

81
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,980
they call this a fun house because there

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,890
was anything but fun we get into this

83
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,890
maze and it's got mirrors it's got

84
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,600
optical illusions every time I would go

85
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,040
running up I'd run up to it I said I

86
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,680
thought I was gonna get out and I'd find

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,359
out my eyes were deceiving me I don't

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,980
run I'd go over here and I see all no

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,850
that was just mirror there's nothing

90
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:08,720
there I couldn't trust my senses and I

91
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:10,190
started to panic I didn't know how to

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,630
deal with that situation I didn't know

93
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:18,829
it was real or fake I couldn't tell

94
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:21,048
where the actual useful information was

95
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,680
and I couldn't trust my senses to help

96
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:27,049
me out this is what attackers are doing

97
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,460
now with what we call deep fakes

98
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,590
now how many in you have heard of deep

99
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,080
fakes before I'm guessing most because

100
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,909
you came to this talk so when I talk

101
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,560
about deep fakes I'm talking about any

102
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:42,199
media that is artificially generated

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,699
using deep learning networks and we'll

104
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,419
talk about what that looks like in a

105
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:50,389
little bit but it could be audio it

106
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:54,378
could just be pictures or as I'm sure

107
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:57,590
many of you have seen it's now also

108
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:59,300
video and really really impressive video

109
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,270
and we'll see an example of that coming

110
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,110
up here in just a few minutes but where

111
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,719
did it begin where do things always

112
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,039
begin if it's valuable technology where

113
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:14,259
does it start anybody want to venture a

114
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:19,639
guess I heard it over here

115
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:21,770
porn any technology in the last 30 years

116
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,509
that has been worth having has always

117
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,250
ended up launching something new in the

118
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:30,409
porn industry and this was no different

119
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,880
so people artists producers whatever you

120
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:34,449
want to call them who are creating porn

121
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,039
videos started to create porn videos

122
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,169
only instead of the actresses that were

123
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,000
in the videos they started putting

124
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:46,490
actresses faces faces of celebrities on

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,240
those bodies we had women like Natalie

126
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,279
Portman gal gadot Natalie Dormer and

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,770
Emma Watson Emma Watson finally was like

128
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,240
you know what I'm out y'all this is just

129
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,469
gonna keep happening I can't do nothing

130
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,590
about it she just gave up

131
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:03,229
talk about apathy and if we can blame

132
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,929
her what can you do about this we're

133
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:08,120
gonna talk about some of those problems

134
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,949
so it didn't take long you know and this

135
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,469
showed up and porn and started to do its

136
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,969
thing we had researchers who were using

137
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:17,000
these neural networks to create some

138
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:19,099
really impressive stuff and as they got

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,919
better well it's her to move into

140
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:26,360
politics we started seeing deep fake

141
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:30,169
targets obviously our present resident

142
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,759
of the White House was included but

143
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,698
we've seen as some of you may have seen

144
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,099
a really popular video out there done by

145
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,680
Jordan Peele where he impersonates

146
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,960
Barack Obama

147
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,520
and Barack Obama is basically you know

148
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:49,090
chewing on everybody in the GOP that was

149
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,680
a few years ago the results of that were

150
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,650
incredible and they tricked a lot of

151
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,880
people but it's gotten a lot more

152
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,650
impressive and I'm going to show you an

153
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:29,289
example here and we're gonna try to get

154
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:31,710
the audio through the mic long story all

155
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:34,210
right we're gonna see biking you

156
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:53,370
anything about that I might not be able

157
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:58,198
to because unfortunately we're slightly

158
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:01,169
ostentatious tired debris from Las Vegas

159
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:06,490
those for my fans have long dismissed

160
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:10,299
allegiance to Impressionists how many

161
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:13,330
opportunities passed up and wasted

162
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:18,460
because he's helped to follow what he

163
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:20,349
must pity the poor impressionist alright

164
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,349
so I don't know how much of it you heard

165
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,820
because unfortunately we some audio

166
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:26,560
challenges here this morning but that's

167
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,080
alright what's not important is the

168
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,060
audio the audio is the actors voice but

169
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,978
the video is what's important and if you

170
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,159
watch that if you're not paying really

171
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,599
close attention those faces switch and

172
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,539
they switch so smoothly

173
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,920
and they look so realistic you wouldn't

174
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,569
even realize that wait a minute that

175
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,150
that's not the person I was watching

176
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,920
just a moment ago and indeed I've talked

177
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,630
to people who you know

178
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,130
I have seen that video and didn't even

179
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,139
realize in Tolleson they looked over one

180
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,279
second was Nicolas Cage the next second

181
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:02,529
it was you know you know somebody else

182
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,010
dr. Phil I think was in there too this

183
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:08,889
is where things have gotten to so far

184
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:12,069
but it's only getting better why is it

185
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:14,470
getting better well it comes down to how

186
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,839
these things are created in the first

187
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,540
place and the design of these deep

188
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,889
learning networks that are creating them

189
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,660
so when we start to talk about how we

190
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:25,500
create deep fakes we're talking about

191
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,540
this thing we call Gans generative

192
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,190
adversarial networks now break that down

193
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,050
and it kind of explains how these things

194
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,089
work first of all they're generative

195
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,569
they're trying to create something from

196
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:39,180
nothing

197
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:42,310
okay that's basically what they do so

198
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,339
they're adversarial well that implies

199
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,410
two parties right competing against each

200
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,630
other that's exactly what happens

201
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,550
there's two deep learning networks

202
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,189
involved here the first is called a

203
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,000
generator the generators job is to as

204
00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:00,699
the name would imply generate content

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,500
the second is the discriminator now the

206
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,899
discriminator again as the name would

207
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,140
imply is there to discriminate what

208
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:10,240
images are real versus what images are

209
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,220
fake now in reality they're all going to

210
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,380
be fake but it is trying to determine

211
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,899
you know it's trying to detect hey

212
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,240
that's a fake image or that's an image

213
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:21,190
that doesn't match the learning center

214
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,980
that training set that I was given and

215
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:29,709
so we use still images to train these

216
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:35,800
neural networks on how to generate and

217
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:37,779
how to detect those images then we just

218
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,670
take a piece of target media so

219
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,160
oftentimes like you saw in that video

220
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,500
it's going to be an actor who you know

221
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,250
is standing in place of the person that

222
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,260
we're trying to create in the video and

223
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:54,060
the generator just starts replacing

224
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:57,970
frames and it starts drawing in new

225
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,680
faces now the discriminator taste those

226
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,860
it looks at it and says okay that's real

227
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,189
it becomes part of the deep fake

228
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,610
here's the trick if it's not that

229
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,490
feedback goes back to the generator so

230
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:16,450
what you end up with here is a constant

231
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,820
loop of the attacker making the defender

232
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,279
better but then the defender making the

233
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,709
attacker better now we've seen this in

234
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,540
info security for you know the entire

235
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:30,010
time I've been in it probably all 60

236
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:32,550
years of it but Ganz accelerate this by

237
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,550
orders of magnitude

238
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,939
so this may seem all ethereal this is

239
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,880
you know these are ganz they exist in

240
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,890
academia and you know we're using

241
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,870
there's a lot of research and my teeth

242
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,720
teaches a whole course on what I just

243
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,610
gave you in about a minute they do a

244
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,190
much better job obviously than I do this

245
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,890
was a little over simplified for you but

246
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,920
the fact the point is this there are

247
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,449
consumer grade options for this so fake

248
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,099
app was kind of the first that was the

249
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,649
first open source one it was thrown out

250
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,180
there pretty hard to find an actual

251
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,250
legit copy of it anymore because

252
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,449
attackers got ahold of it and it was

253
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,730
open source so they just started

254
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,800
inserting you know malware and other

255
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,750
garbage into the libraries and posting

256
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,310
them so if you do a search for fake app

257
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,440
you'll get lots of results and trying to

258
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,779
figure out the one that's genuine it's

259
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,700
probably not worth your time now face

260
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,700
swap on the other hand is more recent

261
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,339
and that one's a little easier to find

262
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,290
so that now brings it down to the level

263
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:34,209
of your desktop now you're not gonna run

264
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,430
the gang on your desktop no it's tied

265
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:40,329
into third party networks that it uses

266
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:43,689
for that what you can create this on a

267
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:45,279
computer and as if that wasn't enough

268
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,779
we'd like to do everything as a service

269
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,100
these days so now we have deep fakes as

270
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,990
a service there's a website out there

271
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,810
are deep fakes web which will create one

272
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,640
online for you the last one you see

273
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,969
there deep nude thankfully does not

274
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:02,380
exist anymore that was an app that was

275
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,930
produced last year and it's supposed

276
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,310
goal was to be x-ray glasses so you

277
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,870
could see what a woman looked like

278
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,939
underneath her clothes and yes indeed it

279
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,380
only worked on women and all it really

280
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,560
was was a deep fake app they had

281
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,019
pictures of what

282
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,498
they would whatever your target was it

283
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:20,089
put her face on top of the woman it

284
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:22,639
lasted a week as you can imagine

285
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,350
thankfully the the community-at-large

286
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,490
wasn't real thrilled of that one

287
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:32,300
so the point of all this is how do you

288
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,990
define real we define real by the things

289
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:38,209
that we observe with our five senses

290
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:42,559
when those five senses are the thing

291
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:44,508
that's under attack that's a pretty

292
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:48,219
inherent attack vector

293
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:50,720
that leaves us scrambling that can have

294
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,730
strong consequences for our society

295
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,240
everything in our society is based on

296
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,220
trust

297
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,110
whether it's banking we had regional up

298
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,699
here before talking about Morgan Stanley

299
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,499
whether it's the stock market which

300
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:03,589
right now is all over the map because no

301
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:05,300
one can trust it imagine now when we

302
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:08,959
have the ability with deep face to

303
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,748
really mess with your minds so what are

304
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,069
some of the attack vectors were seen how

305
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:14,899
about social engineering

306
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:16,339
so I mentioned audio before we kind of

307
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,500
when we talk about deep face we get snow

308
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:21,709
wrapped up in the video we forget that

309
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,809
audio is one of the major targets here

310
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:28,518
and indeed last year it came out that

311
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:33,800
there was a oil company in the UK where

312
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:37,629
the CEO mistakenly wire transferred 220

313
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:41,149
euros to our 220 million euros excuse me

314
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:42,559
to the CEO of their parent company

315
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:44,629
because he received a phone call from

316
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,969
the CEO telling them to make this wire

317
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:50,209
transfer my problem was I wasn't the CEO

318
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:53,000
it was a deep faked audio version of the

319
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,768
CEO telling him to do this and in fact

320
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,329
once wasn't enough for these guys they

321
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,009
actually came back a week later tried to

322
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,239
do it again thankfully he kind of

323
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:02,959
learned his lesson at that point and

324
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,439
didn't fall for it twice but this is a

325
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,679
significant issue how often do we go off

326
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:11,329
with the voices we hear as a means of in

327
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,649
our daily lives just authenticating the

328
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:17,449
person we're talking to so this leads

329
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:21,709
into an interesting attack factor then

330
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:25,059
what about extortion now yes this

331
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:26,858
particular instance when mr. Bies owes

332
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:28,329
from everything I've read and his own

333
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,879
admissions doesn't sound like there was

334
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:33,008
anything phony about the pictures and

335
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,189
things they were using against him but

336
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:38,619
what's to stop that be in the next step

337
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:40,598
does it have to be something real for to

338
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:42,669
have an impact on his position in that

339
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:47,919
company does it have to be something

340
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:49,718
real to ruin a marriage just the threat

341
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,289
of that is enough to manipulate most

342
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:55,149
business leaders so let's talk about

343
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:59,559
business for a minute you all know what

344
00:15:55,149 --> 00:16:01,329
insider trading is right what about the

345
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,579
idea of outsider training

346
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:05,468
well this I've never heard of outsider

347
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:09,029
training before what is that I'm going

348
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:11,589
to tell you because I made it up so

349
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:13,119
imagine this for a second imagine Tesla

350
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,739
is about to release their newest model

351
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:16,989
they have a launch tomorrow they're

352
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:18,939
gonna launch the model Q they've been

353
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:20,169
you know amping it up for months and

354
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,608
months and months I have no idea if

355
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:23,199
there's a model Q don't don't run out

356
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:26,319
and look to invest in that I have no

357
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,309
idea that's again made up here but the

358
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,498
night before they're going to launch a

359
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:34,899
video surfaces of Elon Musk in a private

360
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:37,689
conversation with somebody talking about

361
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:40,359
how there's problems with the vehicle

362
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:41,769
productions going to be delayed things

363
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:46,419
of that nature what's gonna happen to

364
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:49,299
their stock it's gonna do that right but

365
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:51,639
if there was a deep faked video what's

366
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:54,069
the smart attacker doing they're

367
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,939
watching that stock crash they're buying

368
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:59,858
buying buying and then when it comes out

369
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,569
maybe they even put it out into the

370
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:04,899
world that this was a deep fake video

371
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:09,039
you know stocks recover test well Tesla

372
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:12,248
launches fine stocks shoot up sell sell

373
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:15,549
sell instant profit right so it's the

374
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:17,319
same thing but if I can do that at a

375
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,569
business level someone the size of Tesla

376
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:26,199
what can I do with the markets of small

377
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:29,320
nations whole industries so much of what

378
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:33,539
we do in the market exists based off of

379
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:36,158
reports and analysts doing what they do

380
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,660
producing their thoughts on these things

381
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:40,510
we trust

382
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,990
these earnings reports that come out we

383
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:47,020
listen to those calls as investors what

384
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:50,170
happens when suddenly that we can't

385
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,240
trust what we're hearing anymore how

386
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:58,420
could an attacker potentially manipulate

387
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:00,820
those markets but there's a flip side to

388
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,290
this too right so it's obvious the

389
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,820
attack vectors here I can create these

390
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:08,740
deep fakes I can do horrible things with

391
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:10,899
them but let's think about this current

392
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,700
situation of political affairs in the

393
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,770
u.s. we have somebody who consistently

394
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,800
is claiming everything that shows up in

395
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:25,750
the media is fake news if it's anything

396
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:30,430
that he doesn't like it's fake news so

397
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:33,310
haven't we just further enabled that now

398
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,050
we've got this people in society know

399
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,360
they can't trust the media they're seen

400
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,820
how much easier does that make it now

401
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,080
for politicians across the board to

402
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,540
stand up there and when something comes

403
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,280
out about them that is not complimentary

404
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:50,560
to them simply claim that it's a deep

405
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,180
fake who's gonna prove you wrong so the

406
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,760
good news is researchers are trying to

407
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,920
help there's a lot of research being

408
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,280
done into technological solutions to

409
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,360
help try to address this first most of

410
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,310
them are looking at the idea of

411
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,760
detection how can we detect deep fakes

412
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:09,730
early on it was simple or relatively

413
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,190
simple if we analyze the video we could

414
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,530
see different distortions we could see

415
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,060
different characteristics artifacts

416
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,730
things in the video that were pretty

417
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,950
telling you wouldn't always have the

418
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,840
right angle of face to make it fit the

419
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:29,920
angle that was in the video that was

420
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:31,899
pretty easy to detect so I'm gonna jump

421
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,890
ahead here because we've got things in

422
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:39,330
the wrong order so another one that was

423
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,560
more recent was the idea of eye blinking

424
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:47,110
so for the longest time you could very

425
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,520
easily detect these by simply trying to

426
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,889
hear what the subject was even blinking

427
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,549
at all think about it we train these

428
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,980
gans we

429
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:55,658
pictures still images how many still

430
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,919
images are there a view out on the web

431
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:02,409
with your eyes closed not many

432
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,450
so they got better ganz started to

433
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,669
create eye closures they started to

434
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,019
blink more often so we couldn't look at

435
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:10,269
the rate of blinking anymore instead we

436
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:12,220
started looking at the speed and some of

437
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:14,999
the natural movements of eye blinking

438
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,119
and what did the gans do they got better

439
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:19,899
this is the nature of how this works so

440
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,658
some of the other ways we've been able

441
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:24,008
to detect it simple warping we look at

442
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:26,080
video especially something like this

443
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:29,590
where it's a Hollywood motion picture

444
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:33,869
from far away it's pretty convincing but

445
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:37,959
then in this particular scene the video

446
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:40,869
zooms in on her face or his face or I

447
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,399
don't know whose face and then as you

448
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:43,600
start to see you can actually I don't

449
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:46,600
know how all you guys can tell but you

450
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,748
can really see a lot of the pixelation

451
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,248
just because we have resolution issues

452
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,739
there's distortions in the cheekbones

453
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:55,330
because again we're trying to shape one

454
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:58,179
face to fit the size and shape of

455
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,309
another and that is a complex thing and

456
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:01,960
these neural networks are trying to

457
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:06,428
improve on that but there's still a lot

458
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,049
of work to do one of the more promising

459
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,749
detection methods in fact they're

460
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:15,100
boasting about 95% detection rate right

461
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:16,480
now is the idea of modeling behaviors so

462
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,109
moving beyond just the simple

463
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,090
technological portions of video analysis

464
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:24,309
but actually looking at the subject of

465
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,090
the deep fake so in the case of Barack

466
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:30,340
Obama as you see here when he's

467
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:32,619
expressing certain emotions or sharing

468
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,109
certain content what are the facial

469
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:36,939
expressions he makes how does he turn

470
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:38,408
his head how does he tilt his head how

471
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,809
often does he blinked as he blink more

472
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:43,239
or less dude does he Pharrell his

473
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:47,259
eyebrows things like that where now it's

474
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:49,480
very context specific and it's doing

475
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:52,330
really well in fact they they're

476
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:56,220
expecting to see by about June ish

477
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:59,619
they're hoping to have 99% accuracy here

478
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,570
what's the problem this works great if

479
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:04,029
you've already loaded that training data

480
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,460
for the subject so if it's a politician

481
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:05,780
you

482
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,060
maybe you can detect it pretty quickly

483
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,530
but what if it's a random CEO that no

484
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,929
one's really thinking about are you

485
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:14,600
going to have a training set all set and

486
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:17,030
loaded and trained up to detect this no

487
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,459
it's going to take time and when we talk

488
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:23,899
about disinformation like this time is

489
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:27,860
of the essence now I mentioned the

490
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:30,320
opposite right this idea of you know

491
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,080
certifying the original so if someone's

492
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,659
gonna claim that it's a deep fake how do

493
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,179
we detect how can we prove that it's not

494
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,600
how can we prove it's authentic and so

495
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:47,240
research researchers are working in

496
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,129
creating cameras that generate some form

497
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,580
of hash some form of signatures some

498
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,310
sort of way to digitally sign that video

499
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:58,310
to authenticate it now what are the

500
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:01,429
challenges with this one you've got to

501
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,960
find the person has the original to what

502
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,330
happens the minute you start uploading

503
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,100
that original to things like YouTube and

504
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,840
Facebook and all these others hosting

505
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,899
services what's the first thing they do

506
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,480
when you upload a video they reprocess

507
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,910
it they run it through a codec so now

508
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,560
we've got a design codecs that are going

509
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:24,020
to maintain some form of reputable chain

510
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,360
of custody of that evidence and you've

511
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,950
got to convince all these medias social

512
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,770
media outlets we haven't exactly been

513
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:34,160
the most cooperative in terms of privacy

514
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,800
and you know detecting fake news and so

515
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:41,870
forth you have to convince them to buy

516
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:43,129
into this so all the researchers are

517
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,360
saying what if we could prevent deep

518
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:49,790
fakes altogether so this is what we're

519
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,010
calling the idea of adversarial / -

520
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,260
Bruce perturbations while that is a

521
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,640
really tough word to say basically what

522
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,070
we're doing here so you don't have to

523
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,180
remember the big horrible words is we're

524
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:04,070
injecting noise into images that is

525
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,830
completely undetectable to the human eye

526
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,899
but as you can see in the images here it

527
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,879
completely messes with all that facial

528
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,870
recognition stuff that we've been using

529
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,310
and it's that facial recognition

530
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,699
libraries that we need in order to

531
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,560
generate these deep fakes

532
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,630
if they can't detect with the faces in

533
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,490
the training set if they can't detect

534
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:28,500
where the faces in that source video

535
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:30,090
they can't produce these videos but how

536
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,950
realistic is it to make sure that every

537
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,240
picture of yours on the entire web that

538
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,870
could ever be used as part of a training

539
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,300
set is treated in such a way it's not

540
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:44,310
very realistic and that can be

541
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:46,020
problematic so the problem here is one

542
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,940
of disinformation I said that before and

543
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,830
I'm sorry my slides went awry to order

544
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,800
so I'm going to go back the problem with

545
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,480
this information is it's sticky right

546
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,129
the way disinformation works first of

547
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,640
all is it plays off of a person's

548
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:02,340
pre-existing biases it tells a story

549
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,940
that fits in to what they already

550
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,379
believe or want to believe so what

551
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,730
happens is when they see that piece of

552
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,950
disinformation it simply gets plugged in

553
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,790
to this logic chain that we form in our

554
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:20,130
brains so we have these different biases

555
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:22,560
these different preconceived notions

556
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,270
these values that we want to believe and

557
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,700
it just plays right into that and fits

558
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,700
into this logic chain as a result it

559
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:34,830
becomes amazingly difficult to dislodge

560
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:40,670
that information so what do we do about

561
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:43,080
it if I want to debunk disinformation

562
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,900
first and foremost I have to educate

563
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,970
people that it's there they have to be

564
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,790
aware of the possibility I think where

565
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,260
we've reached that point I think 99% of

566
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:56,399
this room raised your hand your new deep

567
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:59,400
fakes existed but then when a deep fake

568
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,800
occurs we have to refute it and we have

569
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,200
to refute it over and over it has to be

570
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,960
repeated over and over and over again

571
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,240
now we get that right I mean we've done

572
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,180
that we've seen that happen a great case

573
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,400
it was not a deep fake but the Nancy the

574
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,040
infamous Nancy Pelosi video where a

575
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,270
couple of your far right-wing folks took

576
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,500
the video slowed it down made it look

577
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:23,430
like she was drunk they posted it to

578
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,830
Facebook even days after it was talked

579
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,780
about that this was fake and this was

580
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,679
you know just someone had had

581
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,770
manipulated the video you

582
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:36,220
we still saw rapid rapid expansion in

583
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:37,870
the shares of this video with posts of

584
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:42,040
people talking about how she was drunk

585
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:44,500
at this particular event so the part

586
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,930
that we tend to forget here is remember

587
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,960
that logic chain if I'm gonna pull

588
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:52,920
something out of that logic chain I have

589
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,800
to replace it with alternative

590
00:26:52,920 --> 00:27:01,390
information something that fits with

591
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,639
reality but also speaks to those biases

592
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,460
those values those preconceived notions

593
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,470
something that will fit into that logic

594
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,870
chain so I can take out the false

595
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,660
information and replace it with reality

596
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:17,679
this is the difficult part this is the

597
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,720
part we have to plan for so when I talk

598
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,660
about deep fakes the challenge here is

599
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,140
we've got all of these you know these

600
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,760
wonderful different technological ideas

601
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,810
of how we're going to detect them we're

602
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:34,660
gonna prevent the reality is the problem

603
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:37,659
here is not technological the problem

604
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,730
here is a human issue and so as

605
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,030
organizations who face this in

606
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:46,120
particular we have to start thinking

607
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:47,770
about how we address the human mind how

608
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,070
are we designing countermeasures for

609
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:54,129
this how are we being able to react to

610
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,389
this so first and foremost if I'm an

611
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,010
organization one of the things I need to

612
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,170
start doing is really controlling how

613
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,210
information about my organization gets

614
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,820
out in the world of social media in the

615
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,400
world of interconnectedness

616
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,220
organizations have gotten sloppy we have

617
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,290
so many methods for how we disseminate

618
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,300
information how people find out

619
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,790
different information how this all gets

620
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,200
released to the public we need to start

621
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,970
consolidating that I'm not suggesting

622
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,760
get out of social media I'm not

623
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,710
suggesting to stop using those channels

624
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,420
but we need to be more methodical and

625
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:29,860
how we do it a little bit longer term we

626
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,940
need to start thinking about how we

627
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:36,219
build in a response plan as part of any

628
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,610
other incident response plan we would

629
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:42,130
have disinformation whether it comes

630
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,469
from deep fakes or some other source is

631
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,659
something we need to start can

632
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,140
sitting as an incident that we have to

633
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:52,169
respond to that means planning to have

634
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,059
media outlets who we trust who will work

635
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:55,799
with us to get that information out

636
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,379
there repeat it over and over again when

637
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,570
we have to refute something they will be

638
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,390
receptive to telling the story in a

639
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,780
fashion that does speak to breaking that

640
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:09,059
logic chain and replacing the false

641
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,530
information with real facts we have to

642
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:13,080
have that plan for how we're going to

643
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:16,789
monitor for this type of information and

644
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:19,379
respond to it quickly longer-term

645
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:21,210
farsighted view we need to start working

646
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,860
and I hate to say this because I know

647
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,539
when I say this our word everybody

648
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,120
freaks out we need to start thinking

649
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:30,870
about regulations we need to think about

650
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,479
working with lawmakers on litigate on on

651
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,520
legislation rather that will address

652
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,380
this right now there's there's a split

653
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,850
view on this and I have to admit I'm

654
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:44,070
torn on it myself on one hand you've got

655
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,539
people's right to not having false

656
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,360
information spread about them on the

657
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:50,309
other hand you have that First Amendment

658
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:54,120
right to be able to produce you know

659
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:57,059
your free speech and to you know share

660
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,020
your commentary on political folks and

661
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,210
so forth

662
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:04,320
and unfortunately the latter is what's

663
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:06,630
winning right now in social media when

664
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,980
we saw the Pelosi video Facebook refused

665
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,240
to take it down they say I was protected

666
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,549
by free speech it didn't violate any

667
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:16,860
other Terms of Service without some form

668
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:19,200
of intervention and it can't just be

669
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,178
politics it can't just be legislation we

670
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,090
do need to pressure organizations as

671
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:27,210
well those social media giants to see

672
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:30,059
that okay this goes beyond just simple

673
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,860
political commentary where we have to

674
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:36,059
start drawing that line and understand

675
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:40,260
where can we start to effectively push

676
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:42,990
change in this now Facebook to their end

677
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,480
they've actually started a competition

678
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,730
right now I was just speaking to some

679
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,780
college students earlier this week about

680
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,000
work they're doing as part of a

681
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,039
competition for detecting feet deep

682
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,260
fakes so Facebook is trying to do

683
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,789
something but I don't think detection is

684
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,009
going to be

685
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:59,570
enough we've seen it with Facebook

686
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:01,249
before we've seen it with Twitter before

687
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,779
we've seen it with Instagram they

688
00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:04,460
implement these policies but they never

689
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:07,159
seem to be implemented in a way that to

690
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,359
you and I makes a lot of sense so I'm

691
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:12,200
not sure that's the end-all be-all

692
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:15,259
answer the good news is there are some

693
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:19,879
positive intentions that you know are

694
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:24,169
applications for deep fakes first any

695
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:27,289
Star Wars fans I'm among friends all

696
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:31,340
right so yeah we had grand moff tarkin

697
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:32,869
was brought back a young Princess Leia

698
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,019
came back both of these were created

699
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:37,970
using the same technology to me that's

700
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,889
that's pretty cool now there's still

701
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:42,710
some questions about how do you you know

702
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:44,719
how do you control who you know is able

703
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,059
to do what they're and permissions and

704
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,679
stuff but well that Hollywood sort that

705
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:50,809
out and I think it's really between them

706
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,009
and you know and if an actor dies hey

707
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:55,729
you know figure it out with their estate

708
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:57,080
right one really cool and that's showing

709
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:59,809
a lot of promise right now is in medical

710
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:04,129
imaging we're finding that using this

711
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:07,519
technology ganzar becoming better than

712
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:11,178
doctors at detecting very early stages

713
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,679
of things like cancer in MRIs they're

714
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:16,539
able to see things that's such a

715
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,409
granular level and detect patterns that

716
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:20,419
they're starting to work with that

717
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:24,080
medical imaging to detect these things

718
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:26,929
sooner there's also work being done in

719
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,449
augmented reality where you call up your

720
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:31,399
doctor and you can have a conversation

721
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:34,669
your doctor only it's not your doctor

722
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:38,199
it's it's a deep faked video and you're

723
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:41,989
talking to you know some other form of I

724
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,759
hesitate to use the term AI but some

725
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:46,279
form of pot or whatever that's giving

726
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:49,700
you health information at least

727
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:52,279
collecting your information and one that

728
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,590
just came out a few weeks ago in the

729
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,239
news and this one I thought this one is

730
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,799
getting mixed reviews some people think

731
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:59,599
it's a terrible thing some people think

732
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:01,519
it's great I thought if nothing else it

733
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:05,299
was very innovative and that's this

734
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,429
politician in India he's the president

735
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:08,950
of I believe it's a BJP party if I

736
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:11,350
recall correctly

737
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:14,289
and he created a video for his

738
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:18,789
constituents he created it in English

739
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:21,549
most people in the more populous areas

740
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,690
of India do speak English but if you

741
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:24,370
know anything about India there's

742
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,909
something like twenty other dialects

743
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:31,629
that are spoken he had them create deep

744
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:33,880
fake versions of that video in all 20

745
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:37,600
dialects so he could reach over 15

746
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,929
million constituents it was very

747
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,719
effective people responded well to

748
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:46,690
seeing their politicians speaking to

749
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,090
them in their native tongues and it was

750
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,919
all deep fake so yeah I mean you could

751
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,240
argue either way on that but I in a way

752
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:56,500
you can't argue it that's at least

753
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,669
pretty dang innovative so before I leave

754
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,159
here today I'm gonna leave you with this

755
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:03,429
clause and I won't read it to you I know

756
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:07,090
it's long but this speaks to the heart

757
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:10,720
of what disinformation is all about so

758
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:15,339
Yuri was a former KGB agent he actually

759
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:18,609
lives now in the United States but I

760
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:21,578
mean this was 1984 and he's commenting

761
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:24,819
on the brainwashing campaign and

762
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:26,829
ideological subversion techniques that

763
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:29,739
the Soviets were using against the

764
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:33,159
United States do we think this is going

765
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:34,689
on still today probably and I don't

766
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,879
think we're the only targets and I don't

767
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:40,599
think that we can claim we're not

768
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,540
targeting other nations too so with that

769
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:45,579
I'm going to share some references with

770
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,929
you so if you have your cell phones this

771
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:48,040
is probably gonna I don't know if you

772
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,780
can read that that well this is

773
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,270
unfortunately the Lighting's not the

774
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,619
greatest I can make these slides

775
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:57,910
available as well after the fact

776
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,680
actually I gave a similar presentation

777
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,089
earlier this week that one for sure will

778
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,009
be recorded I'm not sure how we're doing

779
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:04,328
over here with recording is it alright

780
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:08,650
so it'll be in the recordings - you'll

781
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:10,089
see it but definitely a lot of the

782
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:15,369
research that's being done around

783
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:19,500
depicts check out these links I'll also

784
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:22,280
say I invite each and every one of you

785
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,620
to continue this conversation

786
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,750
feel free to reach out to me on social

787
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,410
media I will share all the information I

788
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:32,090
can with you I can share some other

789
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:35,060
information I mentioned MIT does this

790
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:36,650
you know week-long course well they've

791
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,330
been publishing the videos from that

792
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:43,990
course so you can actually go out if you

793
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:43,990
search for MIT and I believe it is

794
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,580
introduction to machine learning you'll

795
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,890
find like I said it's a week-long course

796
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,870
and they cover a lot of the topics we

797
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,730
talked about here today they walk you

798
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,230
through the construction of Ganz they

799
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,230
get very technical so if you want to

800
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,820
know more about the algorithms at hand

801
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,410
very good source for that as well

802
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,850
it's where I've gotten a lot of the

803
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:07,370
information that I've been able to learn

804
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:09,650
and gather but definitely check out

805
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:13,069
those studies get in touch with me I'm

806
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,510
always happy to discuss I actually got

807
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,470
that a little earlier than I had planned

808
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,000
I'd plan to leave some time for

809
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,629
questions but I've got quite a bit of

810
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,150
time so are there questions for me

811
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,370
related to the research we've seen

812
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:39,080
related to the threats anything of that

813
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:41,029
nature yeah so the question is what

814
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,470
about fraudsters using deep fakes and is

815
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,840
there more information out there

816
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:49,100
unfortunately there's not a lot right

817
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:52,070
now there were literally a few Forbes

818
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,319
articles that I found there's been some

819
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:57,590
research there is the the one story that

820
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,290
came like I said out of the UK but this

821
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,330
is part of the issue honestly with deep

822
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,160
fakes at the moment and again I just so

823
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:06,529
I was just out at that that big

824
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,319
three-letter conference in California

825
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:11,690
earlier this week and what I found there

826
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,570
was everybody when they think deep fakes

827
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,100
everybody's thinking about the political

828
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:17,870
applications of this no one's really

829
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,700
looking at the other applications right

830
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:23,420
now my worry is after we get through

831
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:24,259
this 2020 cycle here in the US where do

832
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,210
we go next

833
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,800
and I've got a feeling we're gonna be in

834
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,970
for a big surprise we have the

835
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,500
opportunity to get it ahead of the

836
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:34,390
attackers right now and I don't think

837
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,390
we're doing that yes

838
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,600
yeah so that's a good point

839
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:23,750
so people need them brought up the fact

840
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,880
that what about the attack vector of

841
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:27,680
just using this for harassment and we

842
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,960
saw what happened already with the porn

843
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,270
industry right and and there is

844
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,250
definitely the case for that especially

845
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,380
as this becomes more consumer eyes the

846
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:38,390
idea of revenge porn and so forth so is

847
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,280
there space for that research there is

848
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,870
space for that research I don't know

849
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,060
that a lot is being done in terms of

850
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:46,520
researching specifically deep fakes

851
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,350
applications to it I am familiar with a

852
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,720
number of organizations right now that

853
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:53,509
have done considerable work in how to

854
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,910
help people defend and recover from

855
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,500
those types of situations revenge porn

856
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,870
being a big one that people are looking

857
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,090
at today one organization in particular

858
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,220
that I'm very familiar with is called

859
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:06,260
badass army and that's an organization

860
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,930
that is working actively with

861
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,450
legislation to try to get things taken

862
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:14,359
care of in that sense they also work

863
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,919
with victims in recovering from this and

864
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,020
there's a few other organizations too

865
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,190
who unfortunately at the moment that the

866
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,500
name of them are slipping my head

867
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,880
slipping my mind I saw one at P sites

868
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,970
Las Vegas last year there's actually a

869
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,470
video out there if you search for it but

870
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,569
yes there's definitely more room to be

871
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,640
done there too because again all you

872
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,020
need I didn't mention this before but

873
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,759
when we talk about that training set

874
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,500
most of these games have gotten to the

875
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,380
point that four or five maybe six

876
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,450
pictures at most is all they need in

877
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,060
order to generate amazingly realistic

878
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:45,220
content so that's a very difficult thing

879
00:39:44,060 --> 00:40:38,420
to defend against

880
00:39:45,220 --> 00:40:39,799
other questions yeah yeah and that's so

881
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,539
that's an interesting point brings up

882
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:42,890
just kind of the the breadth of what

883
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,250
some of these attack vectors are and

884
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,470
even the capability of people to

885
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,789
intentionally attack themselves so

886
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:52,430
industry and so forth where it might

887
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:54,740
actually be advantageous to cause an

888
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:58,069
issue of some fashion and in those

889
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,930
situations yeah you know it is what it

890
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:02,390
is is the changing paradigm in attacks

891
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,430
and that and that's a simple matter here

892
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:07,400
is you know we've we've seen over time

893
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:09,200
you know we start with very technical

894
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,000
hacks and that that's certainly my

895
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,549
background and background of a lot of us

896
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,529
here we've been slowly over time we've

897
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:18,529
been talking more and more about the

898
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:20,420
human element or the human factor we see

899
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:24,289
that that was the theme out in

900
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:27,019
California this week this is the next

901
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:29,000
step on that I mean this is now not only

902
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:31,160
we just attacking people's consciousness

903
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,859
we've taken it to a level of attacking

904
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,839
their actual senses and how they

905
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:38,740
evaluate the world around them evaluate

906
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,740
what's real and fake

907
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:46,059
it's a massive new form of social

908
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:49,450
engineering yes anything else

909
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:49,450
one last one

910
00:41:55,150 --> 00:42:02,750
yes yeah there's a lot of research going

911
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,450
right now on the medical imaging side

912
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,640
and that's where it's it's impressive so

913
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,379
right now they're looking at just

914
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,819
medical imaging but they are actually

915
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,619
sending even beyond that's where they're

916
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,720
digitizing other forms of information

917
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:16,630
coming in and they're leveraging it for

918
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,319
that actually another exciting

919
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,360
development that I've seen research

920
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,410
being done using the same technology is

921
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,540
they're actually using it to analyze

922
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,129
malware so they take malware they're

923
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,110
able to convert it whether it's filelist

924
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,460
whether it's it's you know your more

925
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,200
traditional malware they're able to

926
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,960
convert it there's two researchers from

927
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,180
McAfee doing this and what they're able

928
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,270
to see is even when it's polymorphic and

929
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,980
it's you know it's self morphing code

930
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:42,350
it's able to detect very specific

931
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,600
patterns in that malware where even as

932
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,759
it morphs it still is able to see those

933
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,529
specific patterns analyzing it the way

934
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,560
they would from a deep fake detection

935
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:54,380
perspective so a lot of research a lot

936
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,259
of things definitely a lot of technology

937
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,300
to be formed here I certainly again

938
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,070
encourage you guys reach out to me I'm

939
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,470
always happy to discuss this share what

940
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,940
I'm seeing my research on this continues

941
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,640
just because it's a topic that I'm

942
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,990
passionate about it's nothing that my my

943
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:13,629
employer does or anything else I just

944
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,629
happen to really find it fascinating so
