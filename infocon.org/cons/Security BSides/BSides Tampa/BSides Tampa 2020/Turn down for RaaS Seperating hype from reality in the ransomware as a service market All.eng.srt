nt start and the other security in

5
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,540
defending the Delaney system brings

6
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,549
we're defending it is digital exhorting

7
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:28,580
sonar Vietnam pretty return down for us

8
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,580
separating from reality and there

9
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:44,780
no no so so yeah just so that we're

10
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,119
clear if you're here here's one I have a

11
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,700
by grant somewhere that's not what this

12
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,979
is about this is how to actually protect

13
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,619
the gets read somewhere they won't let

14
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:57,020
break they won't let me give you the how

15
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,880
to be good is being at doing ransom

16
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,460
we're talking about at least not on

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,839
shore I've heard their rumors that they

18
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,229
want to do one of these conferences

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,270
twelve miles offshore and and in that

20
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:12,380
case off you go to twelve on how to be

21
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,910
good at ransom so so we're going to talk

22
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:19,780
a little bit about ransom where's the

23
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,780
service and that's a little bit about me

24
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,310
[Music]

25
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,019
before we get into ransom or service

26
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,060
let's talk a little bit about the

27
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:33,709
current state of ransomware sort all on

28
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:36,850
the same page there's been a sea change

29
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:40,970
in ransomware and how ransomware works

30
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,560
you know so 2015 and 16 you saw a big

31
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,920
surge in ransomware but primarily

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,930
targeting consumes large scale efficient

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,320
campaigns that handlings emails a month

34
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:56,230
etc the and primarily delivered via

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,329
fishing and when they're on vacation

36
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:04,670
the big ones got together people who

37
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:06,799
Microsoft Safari applets ever got

38
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,690
together and they took some steps to

39
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,150
block provocative attacks they did a

40
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,030
better job of just sending these

41
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,870
phishing

42
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:20,730
directly to spam holders isolating

43
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,560
browsers in creating creating say boxes

44
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,310
inside the browser so that the web

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,980
exploitation actually less affected etc

46
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:36,410
and so in 2007 saw huge drop-off from

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:39,060
France more tax starting in 2018 that

48
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,730
started to accelerate by the change in

49
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,370
targets primarily targeting large

50
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:48,049
organizations medium sized organizations

51
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,810
so move away from consumer businesses

52
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:53,519
and wait some more attacks are still

53
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,150
among the most profitable forms of

54
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,819
cybercrime

55
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,650
so for one a little-bitty thought that

56
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,720
we're gonna move over to those like a

57
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,100
crypto mining model turns out it's

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,260
really hard to make a lot of money

59
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,209
crypto fighting it's really easy to make

60
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:11,450
a lot of money at ransomware if you're

61
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:14,160
good at what you do and so feel because

62
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,108
we've gotten more palpable and because

63
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,358
the targets have moved from consumers

64
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,039
business we've also seen in the

65
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,140
acceleration and ransom demands

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,510
so rates and then you sneak up on new

67
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,340
bucks then couple thousand dollars down

68
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,680
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands

69
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,719
and just so on the other days were six

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,310
million dollars which will jump to

71
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:39,180
twelve million if they don't pay in the

72
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:43,910
next six days etc so and we've also seen

73
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:47,460
a change in the way the attacks happen

74
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,919
phishing is still what we think is the

75
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,359
primary deliberate method but we're

76
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,909
really seeing the growth in we're seeing

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,669
the growth in remote exploitation and

78
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,530
especially remote desktop protocol so

79
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,810
remove Desktop Protocol taking advantage

80
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,900
of our abilities that also taking the

81
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,440
damage and password reuse or just using

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,080
low-level admin accounts

83
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,010
Desktop Protocol but we're also seeing

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,979
exploitation of Citrix MMC VPN

85
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:21,490
exploitation etc so the attackers are

86
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:24,850
looking for the attempters are looking

87
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,400
for other ways in access into your

88
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:31,150
services and one of the things you have

89
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,039
to keep in mind is that some of these

90
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,370
attackers are making millions of dollars

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,560
a year

92
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,390
others millions dollars here they're

93
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,760
taking that money in they're developing

94
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,729
next place so you're buying X placing

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,480
them in our markets and and I use a

96
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,640
sermon on the dark web scary

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,960
I feel like I need to get a shot at a

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,330
time I use the term hard well but so

99
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,700
we're seeing them invest in that so

100
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,580
we're seeing sort of this expansion of

101
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,140
model now the basic works right like we

102
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,620
still see a whole lot of attacks and

103
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:09,550
start with hey you need to go over this

104
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:12,190
invoice click on it and pay us and we

105
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,470
install the ransomware that way but they

106
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:19,180
are investing in more sophisticated

107
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,410
methods as well and now we've had an

108
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,300
extortion to that

109
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,919
so we're saying sorry for those big

110
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,040
extortion I'm sure you've seen those

111
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,479
where if you refuse to pay the ransom

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,610
because over because we're not pay

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,590
ransom they say that's fine we stole

114
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,630
seven hundred gigs of files off your

115
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,539
network preview and publish those on a

116
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,760
website um and you don't pay us money so

117
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,669
you don't have to pay the ransom but not

118
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:47,200
a distortion so extortion is a big thing

119
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:48,549
I will tell you that it's been

120
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,610
interesting watching

121
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:55,900
the bad guys trying to figure out

122
00:06:51,610 --> 00:07:00,300
extortion because the extortionist led

123
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:02,590
to bringing the courts into it so Mays

124
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,110
Hayes ransomware which is sort of the

125
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,929
most

126
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,810
doing that they created a big

127
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,090
commutative website nice news.com they

128
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,770
also created news maize that topic piece

129
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,560
that we've got taken away this they're

130
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:19,039
not very creative and they literally

131
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,740
trying to host the site in Ireland turns

132
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,759
out that's a huge TV PR violation they

133
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,069
got sued

134
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,139
obviously they didn't directly get soup

135
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,900
of the hosting Fryeburg option not only

136
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,129
did the site have to come down but the

137
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,349
hosting provider went out of business

138
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:35,960
because apparently that's a really bad

139
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:39,620
violation of GDP are the most private

140
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,750
information like that so while the

141
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,400
extortion is an interesting idea they're

142
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,750
going to be legal problems that I don't

143
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,940
think a lot of the rest we're out there

144
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,190
slog through they're currently hosting

145
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,460
the site in China which oddly and I'm

146
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,379
going to find this hard to believe has

147
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,878
an issue to take down border yet there

148
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:59,509
hasn't been anything in the Chinese

149
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:02,389
courts to shut that or site down so that

150
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,620
may be one way around it if you're

151
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,379
trying to figure out how to publish

152
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:11,029
information otherwise like most of the

153
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:14,060
time so maybe the paper have been

154
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:15,590
publishing that one when these

155
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,500
underground forums will publish the

156
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,330
nature there which is bad as it gets the

157
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,639
data out there but it doesn't quite have

158
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,529
the same impact because if you can't

159
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,080
find it this is one an onion site

160
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,000
somewhere it's not as you know it

161
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,279
doesn't have as big an impact it's not

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,279
as big a coercion to make people pay so

163
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:39,228
who they're attacking we've seen a lot

164
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,679
of attacks against state local

165
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:48,079
governments that was a huge story 2019

166
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:50,149
is continuing in 2020 so we you know

167
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:54,829
recorded future we identified more than

168
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:58,579
110 Republican publicly reported attacks

169
00:08:54,829 --> 00:09:00,649
against state local governments in 2019

170
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,630
the numbers probably significantly

171
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,790
higher the next those just the ones that

172
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,250
were publicly recorded I will tell you

173
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,719
that in January

174
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:13,150
wary of 2019 we had recorded nine of

175
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,630
attacks so far in January and February

176
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,280
of 2024 up to 18 publicly reported

177
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,560
attacks against state local governments

178
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,390
so these attacks are not just continuing

179
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,430
that they're accelerating and yes I

180
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:28,540
realize the whole extra day to get those

181
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:32,170
nine mr. Jackson this year but it still

182
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:34,120
seems like they're celebrating and the

183
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,910
payouts from the state local governments

184
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,040
make the advertisement so state local

185
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,230
government actually less likely pay than

186
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,339
other entities more than like your

187
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:48,190
health care is or finances what because

188
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,750
it makes the news they use these in the

189
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,460
underground when they're selling their

190
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,210
exploit as a service than underground

191
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,650
market so they'll say hey look you know

192
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,360
this city people hundred thousand the

193
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,300
city paid a hundred thousand the city

194
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,770
think this and of course and then their

195
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,990
forums they read the news about that

196
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,660
other stuff so they're fully aware of

197
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,010
what's happening you know out in the

198
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,040
real world

199
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,780
and so they see that as well so even

200
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,660
though state governments are actually

201
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:21,189
less likely to pay they make a good

202
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,719
selling tool in Indian drug force public

203
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,030
here's another big one we're seeing a

204
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,050
big reversing like had a big

205
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:33,160
acceleration 30 or 40 past of 2018 up to

206
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,780
47 in 2019 a lot of these attacks are on

207
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,890
the reported and in fact it's

208
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:43,329
interesting so Health and Human Services

209
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:46,840
issued a issued guidance in 2016 saying

210
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:51,490
that because personally identifiable

211
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,140
information could be temporarily

212
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,580
compromised during a ransomware attacks

213
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,270
so even though we've been it's not

214
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,400
stolen

215
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,630
the fact that you've lost access to it

216
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,560
for any sort of length

217
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:04,600
time could mean that you should be

218
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,229
considered a compromised and that makes

219
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,970
it a reportable event so it's really

220
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,060
interesting watching some of these

221
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:16,270
attacks or the aftermath of some of

222
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,339
these attacks the healthcare providers

223
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,460
will bring in forensics companies that

224
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:24,040
go out of their way to identify that no

225
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,840
personally identifiable information was

226
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,089
actually compromised during the attack

227
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,050
so that way they don't have for rhetoric

228
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:34,570
the Health and Human Services it's like

229
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:38,760
a whole cottage industry that has sprung

230
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:42,190
up around done anything which is not

231
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:45,160
great I understand why nobody wants to

232
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,130
have to report things but it is

233
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,780
something even mine when you see the

234
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,780
number of attacks again there they're

235
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:56,829
probably severely unreported the u.s. is

236
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:59,800
not alone there were 102 publicly

237
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:03,100
recorded attacks in United Kingdom 118

238
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:07,180
in Spain 47 single Ford cetera so this

239
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,760
is a worldwide problem oddly not as big

240
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:14,729
a problem in Russia and that's because a

241
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,230
lot of ransomware actors specifically

242
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,030
configure their ransomware so that it

243
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,470
won't install if you have a Russian

244
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,530
English pack word you're using this

245
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,570
really keyboard Russian Cyrillic not

246
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:29,350
Ukraine's really great slogan under

247
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,940
small what you want so I'm not saying

248
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,720
these are Russian actors I'm just saying

249
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,100
they don't reveal who's bad side also if

250
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,020
you want to protect yourself romance

251
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,670
aware the number one thing you can do is

252
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,189
change your language pack of

253
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,900
and your keyboard layout to Sevilla we

254
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,220
need the rest of your communication and

255
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,050
everything difficult by pretty much

256
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:53,540
guarantee you won't get hit the

257
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:56,300
ransomware so the other thing and again

258
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,719
I don't recommend this as a strategy I

259
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,719
was in the city doing an instant

260
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,790
response about six months ago they had a

261
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,450
hundred machines that were hit with

262
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,040
ransomware I was right ransomware a

263
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,840
hundred machines that were hit the only

264
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,670
two that weren't were running Windows 98

265
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,850
that's because Windows 98 doesn't have

266
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,040
necessarily api's they're crooked guys

267
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,080
that the rents were uses so we were

268
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,420
running all windows 98 to be perfectly

269
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,150
safe again not recommending that as

270
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:31,640
strategy I'm just saying that it worked

271
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:35,540
in that particular case so Rex where's

272
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,569
the service those we don't know ransom

273
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,030
is a service or what we call brass

274
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:43,550
gently work by allowing attackers and

275
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:46,310
experienced attackers to gain access to

276
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,370
ransom or infrastructure so basically

277
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:52,040
what you have is you get an executable

278
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:55,220
so you give the seller money they give

279
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,449
you an executable and a control down you

280
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,250
go ahead and deploy the ransom or

281
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,770
however you're going to deploy it they

282
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,650
take care of processing the ransom

283
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,120
payment they take care of control panel

284
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,160
for the victims and as well as for

285
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,530
yourself and all that other good stuff

286
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,300
and then they take the cut off the top

287
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,910
usually somewhere between 10 and 30

288
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,640
percent of anyone the configuration that

289
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,610
you have set up so if your notice that

290
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,680
you really want to get into ransomware

291
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,950
it's a quick and easy way to do them so

292
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,050
if you run a successful spamming service

293
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,360
or you run a successful boss service you

294
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,949
like you know what I need more money I'm

295
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,870
going to get into ransomware I can use

296
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,920
one of these grants worth of services to

297
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:38,660
do it you find these and generally for

298
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,310
sale men around Florence and dark level

299
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,510
that we do see some that openly sell

300
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:47,479
this stuff on Twitter or YouTube and the

301
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:50,960
growth abroad service has helped to

302
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,720
accelerate ransomware attacks so 2015/16

303
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,700
generally there were a dozen groups that

304
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,230
you needed to worry about now there are

305
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,000
literally hundreds of groups that we

306
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,430
need to worry about there's still only

307
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,780
about it doesn't ransomware did

308
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,939
different rants more variants that you

309
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,829
actually need to worry about but there

310
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,080
are hundreds of groups behind those now

311
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,000
so you have many more people attacking

312
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,770
using many different methods of attack

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,210
to deliver their ransomware and so even

314
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,400
though it may be the same dozen that are

315
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,570
still problems you now have a lot of

316
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,870
different angles that they're going

317
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,510
after

318
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,640
so one of the first was Sten pala for 39

319
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,840
bucks you can buy the executable now

320
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,000
this is old-school back doesn't please

321
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,590
you know so there's a little control

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,050
panel or anything cool like that all you

323
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,360
got was the executable your deliberative

324
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,069
how we would view encrypted and absolve

325
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,570
email exchange for how to do it so

326
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,060
that's kind of one of the first ones

327
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,590
that we saw doing that ransom 32 is

328
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:54,199
another one worked roughly the same

329
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:57,620
model etc not very good it was not very

330
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,540
good and the computer was quickly

331
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,360
released and it wasn't updated beyond

332
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:06,170
that so your full lifetime license

333
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,990
didn't really mean anything but but they

334
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:13,069
were successful

335
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:16,700
probably the most successful there we go

336
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,980
is in track so in grab this one most

337
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:23,660
successful grasshopper Inc started in

338
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:26,690
2018 retired in 2019 and they were

339
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,150
retired because the FBI had a ball

340
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,540
seized all their infrastructure so you

341
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:35,930
know kind of like retired from targets

342
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,760
because you shocked that did 300 big

343
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,280
bells with the stuff and a score to go

344
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,200
out they claimed to have made 250

345
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,640
million from the

346
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:49,360
we're and that is just their cuts they

347
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:53,439
claimed over 2 billion overall again

348
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,240
that's dubious but overall based on the

349
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,940
number of submissions so a virus federal

350
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,430
etc there were a lot of attacks that use

351
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,960
successfully used in graft so more than

352
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,679
likely they did make a whole lot of

353
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,199
money and they went to they went from

354
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:15,579
this so this was their original had back

355
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:18,280
in January of January of 2018 this was

356
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:21,069
their original had you know they talk

357
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,869
about their dashboard how you can you

358
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,869
know what what its capabilities are etc

359
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,790
they went from that to an

360
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,710
invitation-only model so they initially

361
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,230
they they they were like hey anybody

362
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,970
come these are service as great as they

363
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,890
got better they realizing is better to

364
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:43,750
be much more selective and who they

365
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:46,570
invited into their into their process

366
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,030
and we see more of the better ransomware

367
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,129
tools now going with that invite-only

368
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:57,810
model as you want to be able to bet the

369
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:59,950
people that are using your service so

370
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,340
brain suppose the service is basically

371
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,130
multi-level marketing for bad guys right

372
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,360
they use some of the same techniques

373
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,580
they refer to their customers as

374
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,889
affiliates so one of the ways that we

375
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,139
track the different campaigns is every

376
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:17,740
campaign has a unique affiliate ID so we

377
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,180
keep track with that they they off the

378
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,890
highlights successful grants more

379
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,380
attacks in their ads even if that wasn't

380
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,540
the ransomware that was having to be

381
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,630
used in that particular attack what they

382
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,490
want to do is they want

383
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:33,169
associate their brand with success and

384
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,600
and how do you think lots of money you

385
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:38,150
rich it you use that so this is an

386
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,949
example of an ad their text only so

387
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,840
they're kind of boring but this is an

388
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,900
example I did the original Russian and

389
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:50,059
then translated it something that I read

390
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:52,400
here it's Russian so this is you know

391
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:54,110
what it's a but it looks like it's the

392
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,910
stable offline criminal Locker which

393
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,949
means that you don't need people to

394
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:01,250
connect and control server in order to

395
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:04,549
do the encryption they offer 24/7

396
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,010
support through their jabber server and

397
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:08,900
this is a big thing customer support is

398
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,460
really important for these Raz offerings

399
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,940
and actually for a lot of the rants more

400
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:17,630
actors I've been on incident response

401
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,460
calls where the incident response

402
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,640
company will sit in a jabber with

403
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,440
ransomware actor for five hours

404
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,080
troubleshooting a problem that are

405
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,539
really big into customer support because

406
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,330
they don't want to get a reputation as

407
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:35,000
oh I need the ransom and I couldn't get

408
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,820
my files recovered so the ones that take

409
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,770
it seriously do offer that sort of level

410
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:44,990
of professionalism so anyway you know

411
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,870
when they talk about their they talk

412
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,340
about their recruitment video they they

413
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,459
like but between our ABS core definition

414
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,500
stop recruiting you know we're going to

415
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,179
customize this to your particular needs

416
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,190
and we're going to provide you with a

417
00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:00,380
stable income rate so that's basically

418
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,980
the same thing is selling Amway get a

419
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:10,700
stable income if you buy our service and

420
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:13,070
uh and use that to attack people and

421
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,330
then I know and I apologize this is hard

422
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,870
to read hopefully it'll show up better

423
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:20,210
in the video but this is ghostly Locker

424
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,469
and one thing they talk about is the

425
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,870
limited availability

426
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,309
so many people joined our vets where's

427
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,629
the service so when we part of our

428
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,220
downline you got to get it now because

429
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,240
if you wait we're gonna close this out

430
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,360
and we're not going to let you have

431
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,669
access to it so if you don't sign up now

432
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,370
you're gonna miss your chance right so

433
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:41,929
right it makes you want to sign up baby

434
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,879
so we're going to talk a little bit

435
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:45,409
about the halves and then we're going to

436
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,870
finish the talk by laughing at the ones

437
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,880
that really sucked because as a vendor

438
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,189
one of the things that my marketing

439
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,809
department never lets me do is talk

440
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,520
about the bad guys that will it suck at

441
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,860
their job because we can't scare you

442
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,059
into buying our stuff if we only if we

443
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,559
ever talked about the bad guys that

444
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,649
suffered their job but they're really

445
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,289
funny so but but there are some that you

446
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:08,960
actually need to worry about so sort of

447
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:12,530
maybe is the biggest one that's the one

448
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,659
that you see most often with infections

449
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,789
right now we're pretty sure that the

450
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:18,140
same is game craft is just this game

451
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,929
drives infrastructure will shut down

452
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,299
last week they were actually shut down

453
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:25,460
they're very selective who they on board

454
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,190
his clients we know they're at least 13

455
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,020
groups using it there may be more the

456
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,720
reason why there's no ad is they don't

457
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,309
advertise the service they go and they

458
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,049
seek out people that they want to bring

459
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:42,590
in they don't run ads anywhere they're

460
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:45,350
also probably the most advanced in terms

461
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:48,020
of how they're delivered so we see

462
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:51,408
fishing most of the time but we've also

463
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,480
seen them rely heavily on managed

464
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:55,159
service providers so what they'll do

465
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,130
this little compromising managed service

466
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,110
provider and then use that managed

467
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,330
service providers access to compromise

468
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,549
the customers that managed service

469
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:06,049
provider which please please please if

470
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,120
you're using managed service providers

471
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:10,280
in networks please just inept

472
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,489
authentication with them and segment

473
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,580
your network so that you can't be

474
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:19,840
corrupted by uh by their attacks we've

475
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:23,129
also seen others that use the RTE

476
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,129
citrus are abilities

477
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:32,890
nem team released in August to 19th 2019

478
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,219
initially distributed by open RDP

479
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:38,860
servers but also protects white district

480
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:42,669
botnet and a series of big big house X

481
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:45,750
they really like it out to be they

482
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:48,309
really like fake PayPal I should say so

483
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:54,279
and this is another one where we're

484
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:56,110
seeing how a gap did they are they and

485
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:59,080
we see this with a lot of the actors

486
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:02,168
down they very closely read security

487
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,850
blogs and security magazines and so on

488
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:05,529
like we see a lot of them rarely

489
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,629
communicate with the reportedly P

490
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:12,340
computer and other security public

491
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:14,620
nations so for example the first version

492
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,720
of MV they had an encryption tool that

493
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,580
was released on october 19 they then

494
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,770
released a new version on October 10th

495
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,299
so October night somebody announced hey

496
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,520
look we found we need encrypt their

497
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:26,049
ransom where you don't have to worry

498
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,090
about paying the ransom you can just be

499
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:30,279
pretty automatically so they came out

500
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,260
with new versions on October 10th they

501
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:33,970
then tell that in the regular forums

502
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,100
about how fast they respond and will

503
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,529
even link to those security articles hey

504
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,209
you saw this article here don't worry we

505
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:43,510
have this fix there's new version out

506
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,429
now and the color should get it out they

507
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,629
limit their affiliate program to 25

508
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:52,059
members so you have to somebody has to

509
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,850
drop out before a new person can join of

510
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:57,700
course it is the dark web so I guess you

511
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,469
could hire somebody to assassinate one

512
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,669
of the 25 members and then take their

513
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,240
place I don't think they particularly

514
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:07,690
care how the spot opens up just a spot

515
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,809
opens up so again this is what their ad

516
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,480
looks like let you know the locklear

517
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:18,860
self-abusive c plus less than it is 132

518
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:21,290
yeah it was to do Windows XP through

519
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,419
through her incursions a convenient

520
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,520
panel panels are very important

521
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,820
everybody likes the nice designer with

522
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,910
the control animals and they let me know

523
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,379
in traffic where it comes from etcetera

524
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,540
so you can see how successful your

525
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,970
campaigns are and adjust your dish you

526
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:44,240
can mean to whatever else you're using

527
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:45,679
for that phobos I counted for almost

528
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,140
time percent of all grants more attacks

529
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,700
in the second half of 2018 which is

530
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,770
weirder this pose doesn't get a lot of

531
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,720
attention in the press but you know to

532
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,059
me you know ten percent of attacks is a

533
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,559
pretty big number again initiative

534
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,629
distributed through open RDP that's

535
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:01,668
where a lot of raptors currently get

536
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:06,110
their start before they partner up with

537
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:07,940
phishing campaigns and Center there's a

538
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,668
lot of shared code base between the dark

539
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,809
dark light crisis ransomware we don't

540
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:13,190
know that that's because they're

541
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:14,809
associated with them where they just

542
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:18,980
straight up stole their code I know it's

543
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:21,379
hard to believe that bad guys would be

544
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:27,740
dishonest in that way but he easily

545
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:30,410
sometimes they are so anyway you know

546
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:33,980
it's one of us to join so that's your

547
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:36,770
initial cost to get in and but if your

548
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,809
wounds do large volume of you know

549
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:42,440
attacks if you want to do large fishing

550
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:45,980
volumes etc they will give you a

551
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,450
discount to gain access they'll give you

552
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,940
if you want to test it out will give you

553
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,130
a test file they will let you encrypt up

554
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,669
the five things that you cannot actually

555
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,799
test to make sure it works they are very

556
00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:00,710
open and ready to discuss whatever your

557
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,480
needs are so that's good you know they

558
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:09,260
want to make sure that they're taking

559
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:12,140
care of you Megan cortex so many cortex

560
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,260
has had a couple of successful hits and

561
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,780
they've made the news they're not very

562
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:21,720
big overall there has been

563
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,810
take an activity set half of 2019 this

564
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,090
is what the rat looks like it's only 100

565
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,590
bucks to get in or 100 euros although I

566
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,750
don't know why every situation of a

567
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,360
hundred euros over a hundred dollars but

568
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,340
yeah they give you that option and then

569
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,830
it's only a 10% fee so basically they

570
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,220
only take 10% of any ransom then you

571
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,990
collect off of it we see them

572
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,240
distributed through peopie the boats

573
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,580
head loaders and then there's been some

574
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,750
reporting that it's been also

575
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:53,970
distributed through the risk of floaters

576
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,610
they are very big on the affiliate thing

577
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,650
they think once not only affiliates but

578
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,959
they want you to get more affiliates so

579
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,180
you basically again like multi-level

580
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,830
marketing right you you give it a

581
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,750
percentage of you bring in an affiliate

582
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,889
you get a percentage of whatever they

583
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:13,380
bring in this ransom so they're trying

584
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:19,440
to make your trending to this attractive

585
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:22,380
as possible for their downline so there

586
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,150
there are those within there the forms

587
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:32,790
were also flooded with a bunch of really

588
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:36,630
bad ransomware and I want everybody to

589
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:38,909
enjoy how bad some of these summer but

590
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,880
keep in mind that a lot of renter's

591
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,950
start off really bad and then are very

592
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,780
good so six months from now the ones

593
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,360
that were laughing at make sure not to

594
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,100
be wildly successful and doing really

595
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,229
well has some of them can be very

596
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,600
adaptive and make updates to their code

597
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,990
as quickly as possible so again one of

598
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,030
the challenges I'm a firm believer that

599
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,680
it's good when secure to companies share

600
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,600
information if you find a piece of

601
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,760
ransomware and it does bad things and

602
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,010
you're right about it I think that's a

603
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,320
good thing because it makes everyone

604
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:12,350
more secure the problem is the bad guys

605
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,750
read that information and they then make

606
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,929
improvements to the ransomware and there

607
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,700
isn't a good way for us to share it so

608
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:23,060
that everybody has access to it and

609
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,710
indeed more secure and also keep the bad

610
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:29,120
guys from reading it to make their code

611
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:32,330
better one of my favorites is

612
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,489
Philadelphia ransomware you can find

613
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,780
discussions with him cuz they've gotten

614
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,610
kicked out of basically every

615
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:42,170
underground form ever

616
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:44,360
there's a ransomware sucks so bad it's

617
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,640
only forty five dollars to sign up and

618
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,659
in addition to Twitter they have this

619
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,100
slick little video there's no sound so

620
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,710
you're not missing anything in there

621
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,959
it's just background music probably get

622
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:00,560
sued by Bri for playing it anyway so

623
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,540
it's but it's the most advanced and

624
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:07,070
customizable

625
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:08,750
ransomware Emma so you know they've

626
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,899
obviously put a lot of time and effort

627
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:13,610
into this five minute sales pitch video

628
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,620
which is great you get to see their

629
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,409
control you know what it looks like how

630
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:23,169
it works it definitely looks like it was

631
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:26,030
designed in 1996 but where you know

632
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:35,270
you'll uh you can see everything that

633
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:38,210
they in anatomists exactly so I've never

634
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:41,389
seen a successful infection of them I've

635
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:45,230
never seen anybody report being infected

636
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,790
by them so I think they pretty much take

637
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:50,720
their forty five bucks they use it by

638
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:52,490
beer or something you know they're not

639
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,380
selling a rate somewhere that's actually

640
00:29:52,490 --> 00:30:04,060
going to change in to actually in

641
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:06,820
anybody so random is another one they've

642
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:12,070
got a cute little that with dust mite or

643
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:14,409
dust bowl or whatever as their mascot no

644
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,419
fees you just pay the upfront cost so

645
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,150
when they have different tiers of human

646
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,040
the low tier it's 95 bucks to join if

647
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,410
you want the height here with the 24/7

648
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,990
support the concierge service it's like

649
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,340
500 bucks to join but the good news is

650
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,800
you don't have to ever pay that many

651
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,850
fees when you do it

652
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,710
hundreds of that it's posted an

653
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,899
underground forms all over the place

654
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,990
whenever there's somebody say hey I need

655
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,850
some rats they need be reply underneath

656
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,850
like they're monitoring all these forms

657
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:46,419
sake hey also new p.m. about our service

658
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:48,490
and so on so we kind of tracked them the

659
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,650
reviews haven't been great it's a

660
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:54,100
standard incandescent and dead for a

661
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,990
long time too so and as memory developer

662
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,709
and summer I think Randy Rancic wears

663
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:02,050
the skin basically we see reviews like

664
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:05,530
that on every form in every place where

665
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:08,409
they have absolutely mostly works but

666
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:10,740
they just are very persistent as posting

667
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,660
everywhere they go

668
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:17,080
kryptonite's is another one

669
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,540
No Fee is just a front cost may be our

670
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,480
one little excuse being this ransomware

671
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:27,950
campaigns so I again I apologize it's

672
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:32,450
hard to see here but like CBS News about

673
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:35,029
Atlanta MSN about the attacks in Florida

674
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,519
actually so they may provide Lisa them

675
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:42,070
no this attacks you stipulate Vincent

676
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:45,409
because that's where wasn't around then

677
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,970
their structure their English structure

678
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:49,639
keeps going the allemande with that

679
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,529
closely it's up for like an hour or two

680
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:52,879
at a time that goes down for days I'm

681
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:54,529
and they bring it back up

682
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,480
they claim to have five hundred

683
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:58,789
affiliates that have signed up for their

684
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,990
service but again you can play there

685
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:04,370
once and we cannot buy the seal cases

686
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,850
successful invention

687
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:10,100
so either the the author again I don't

688
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,269
find this hard to believe the hawkers

689
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,860
lying about the fight with their

690
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:17,539
affiliates or they're all really really

691
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:20,330
bad at their job and the other really

692
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:23,658
bad because he's never had a successful

693
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:26,570
one clashing you so those are kind of

694
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:28,610
some of the bed normally I kind of end

695
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,590
this with things you can do to protect

696
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,149
yourself a brand similar but that's not

697
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,408
this kind of conference I think you all

698
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:36,830
know what you can do to protect yourself

699
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:38,659
and ransomware so I'll just end it with

700
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,820
questions we have like seven eight

701
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:42,110
minutes yeah yeah so if you have any

702
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,000
questions I'm happy to answer them

703
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,418
otherwise it's kind of like did what we

704
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,340
lead to maybe this isn't what the

705
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:58,130
companies reason for that makes it bad

706
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:59,959
what mistakes that so a lot of SATA Keys

707
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,570
need there's making bad so that you know

708
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,110
basically one key will decrypt all of

709
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:08,899
them but most of it is bad operational

710
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,879
protocol so the riot keen is one of the

711
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:12,408
best out there they didn't start off the

712
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,330
best but they're they're currently one

713
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:16,399
of the best and that's because they're

714
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,820
very they're very into dishes how they

715
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,488
deploy they're very careful

716
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,289
the targets and they sit the network for

717
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:26,489
a couple weeks Gloria and understanding

718
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:31,320
that work for you so what makes it that

719
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:35,039
makes a lot of that that is not not not

720
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,229
really what the what people are

721
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,200
monitoring the networks not knowing what

722
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:41,789
security protocols are monitoring etc so

723
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,809
they quit your antivirus is looking for

724
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:45,710
whether you're advanced and what

725
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:49,619
infection is looking for etcetera and so

726
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:51,869
for a lot of these the plane but so but

727
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:55,259
his underground term that means fully

728
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:56,999
unadaptable they're not the video

729
00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:00,899
because they're not taking the proper

730
00:33:56,999 --> 00:34:03,299
steps things like there ways with

731
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:05,789
something up in this chair but there are

732
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:09,089
ways to bypass standard antivirus action

733
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:11,159
there are even ways to bypass like

734
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:13,379
advanced and point protection they're

735
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,290
not doing any of that in their master so

736
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:19,199
they're easily picked off by by most

737
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,940
antivirus programs etc so the

738
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,589
combination of the software's path but

739
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,929
then the operators themselves are also

740
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:27,569
bad because you've been deploying a

741
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,369
crappy ransomware in a network where

742
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:31,109
nobody's monitoring their antivirus and

743
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:34,559
they haven't updated in six months being

744
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:36,808
good as we're not in that state pick on

745
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,970
Baltimore for a second Baltimore was did

746
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:39,750
by Robin Hood Robin Hood is just crap

747
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:41,819
ransomware

748
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,379
it just happened it so happens that it's

749
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:46,799
even Baltimore might happen to be worse

750
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:49,109
than the team behind Robin you've been

751
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:50,668
successfully deployed progress we're in

752
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:53,369
a crap net we're going to crap your

753
00:34:50,668 --> 00:35:12,230
network but if you're not smart enough

754
00:34:53,369 --> 00:35:20,430
to know where deployed you're not right

755
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:21,310
reason why I asked a few cases just

756
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,910
recently

757
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,860
well that's right and the superblock

758
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,549
guess it kind of raises some questions

759
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:34,360
that rivals every sort of proliferating

760
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:36,490
other groups they just know we've seen a

761
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,560
couple times where the code base is got

762
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:42,790
slow so that's probably what you saw

763
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,730
there again that does or that guys that

764
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:47,350
got steal from each other and so if you

765
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,820
take you know if you saw the problem

766
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,270
with writing is if you take their code

767
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,980
base

768
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,080
you can't just the point because it's a

769
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,900
manual code you have to like enter a

770
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,970
password to the point so they don't even

771
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,260
trust themselves stuff off you know fax

772
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,089
definitely not the point

773
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,010
so you have to before you deployed the

774
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:05,110
Red Square you have to put a passcode in

775
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,850
and then it gets the COI so if you take

776
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,890
that code base and you rewrite in to

777
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:10,000
avoid all of that nonsense you're going

778
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,319
to get rid of some of the things that

779
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,410
make it as good as they are and that

780
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,750
would be for that kind of sloppy second

781
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:19,089
you're talking about

782
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:22,120
listen so just like in the crypto mining

783
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:25,090
you know you saw the ships go from your

784
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,740
standard operating systems in July I

785
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:30,270
have a few devices it's not like that

786
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:32,290
are you guys seeing anything where the

787
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:34,030
ransomware folks were trying to move

788
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:38,830
into critical infrastructure say like a

789
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:41,110
Cisco IOS and Geno's so not those

790
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:43,060
there's definitely some ways yes stuff

791
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,160
that the ranch marketers are looking in

792
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,049
and will see this every now and then

793
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,420
like I said there's a big excoriated

794
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,940
lesson for a whole week about how Kenyan

795
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,470
cameras were vulnerable to dress and

796
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,880
more attack the day you get on camera

797
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,620
through the water listening crypt that

798
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,410
and it's not quite when you're talking

799
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,540
about that same kind of think the

800
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,310
problem of that is if you turned my

801
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,680
Cisco rather I'm just gonna remove it

802
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,779
and start up again I'm not it maven

803
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,970
notice that you've encrypted anything on

804
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,740
that because I admitted networks where

805
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:14,500
they haven't posted Cisco routers in two

806
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:16,740
years I mean just not my babies haven't

807
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,000
walked in in two years to do anything

808
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,899
and same thing you know there's always

809
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,480
concerned

810
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,950
well my home brother

811
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,050
we're ready to come brother so the

812
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,210
wrestler are you ever going to notice it

813
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,800
like I know you and I'm building an

814
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,350
update on our home brothers every time

815
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,960
there's a new firmware update etc most

816
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:36,960
people get their home out from their ISP

817
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,630
and don't ever touch it again until they

818
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,590
set a new highest a turn so there is B

819
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:45,150
sends them a new one so ICS but the

820
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,910
critical infrastructure that controls

821
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,369
like the water and electricity we

822
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:53,399
definitely see some interest in that we

823
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,020
have seen any success what we found is

824
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,310
we don't have definitely advanced

825
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,380
parameters that are trying to collect

826
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:01,109
royalties stuff and nobody need them

827
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,730
either nobody noticed or they rebooted

828
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:05,549
in by the background the same thing we

829
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:09,000
see every now and then WordPress like

830
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:11,820
will encrypt your WordPress website well

831
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,950
then must be website it reset it up I'm

832
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:20,780
not going to pay ransom there you know

833
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:20,779
for small whatever you know furries page

834
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:36,859
rightfully just because I really like

835
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:38,820
furry so that's that's a huge thing

836
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:41,009
that's why I always encourage people

837
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,510
it's not just enough that backups or

838
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,369
backups have to be disconnected from

839
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,020
your network so the first thing the

840
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:48,900
ransomware after does when they get on

841
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,790
the good ranch back there is it leave

842
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,440
everything in your shadow box idea if

843
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,270
there's all your shadow the files are

844
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,390
simply backups of things and recent work

845
00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:00,810
one so with all that gone and then they

846
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:03,180
will look for they will look for things

847
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,950
on your network that look like backup

848
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,450
servers and they'll give those first

849
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,520
before they forget everything else

850
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:10,750
because they want the backup server

851
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,540
encrypted and access

852
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,580
they can encrypt it in fact one of the

853
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,130
things I suggested people looking from a

854
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,470
pot and this is a real suggestion not

855
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,940
one of my usual think one spam if you

856
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,859
are trying to go on a pot in your

857
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,120
network to the program for a rascal

858
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,220
after and you want sort of the early

859
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,350
warning Trinity is the accessible server

860
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,450
called backup one or something like that

861
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,310
the ransom parameters won't go for that

862
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:37,480
and that will be what they try me very

863
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:39,180
first so it actually makes it really

864
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,250
interesting but the good ones will

865
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:45,160
others will just you know encrypt

866
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,810
whatever busted in Devon and go but

867
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,970
they're always looking for backups that

868
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,330
one in critical backups may be that much

869
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,069
harder

870
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,270
the other good news is most time they

871
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,800
don't have to because most people don't

872
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,530
actually check their members to see

873
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,360
whether or not they actually work and so

874
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,710
they don't find out until after the

875
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,300
ransom or attack they haven't backed

876
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,270
anything up in three years they've just

877
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:09,490
been you know we're facing an empty team

878
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:12,600
there were three months versus hey I

879
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,600
think you're finished only thing

880
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,650
[Applause]
