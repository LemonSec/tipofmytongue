thanks everyone first of all I would

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,770
like to thanks beside Tampa for inviting

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,439
me for coming here and presenting on

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,619
this topic which is near and dear to my

36
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,079
heart which is our Sam software shows

37
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,540
maturity model I'm super excited to be

38
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,939
here and one of the key thing or key

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,430
reason about my excitement is I'm really

40
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,380
from Florida and I always look for the

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,860
opportunities to come back to Florida I

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,240
was a student about 21 years back in

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,250
small used to town nearby called

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Gainesville and I have a lot of fond

45
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,479
memories coming to Florida here in Tampa

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,369
Clearwater Beach etc before we start the

47
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,250
talk house a rehearing

48
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,800
is it okay

49
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:14,080
cool thank you so let's took a look at a

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,440
quick professional journey line I

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,780
started my engineering studies back in

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,220
India and started working as a developer

53
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:27,340
back in 90s after that I came to us to

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,100
do masters in computer science and I got

55
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,590
introduced to the security concepts most

56
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,140
of the time they were I spent in Florida

57
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,540
was trying computer science I got

58
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,890
excited about cryptography and which led

59
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:45,040
me towards creating basically you're

60
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,049
forming opinion that if I want to work

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,679
in software probably Security's the one

62
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,110
of the fields I would like to focus

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,170
however around 2005 is when I got

64
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,850
opportunity to work in to professionally

65
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,480
into the security space when I was at

66
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:05,470
Dell and that was facing lot of security

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,560
challenges so I volunteered for testing

68
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,930
for security apps like challenges that

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,630
Dell was facing which led me towards

70
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:18,130
building a program and bootstrap a

71
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:20,489
software shun's program at EMC and after

72
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:25,290
spending about six and a half years I

73
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:28,300
went to work for Intuit Amazonians plunk

74
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,700
past couple of years I'm also involved

75
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,250
in start-up by advising some of the

76
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:37,230
security and privacy startups in the

77
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:39,760
space and I also advise one of the

78
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:43,660
security certification trade

79
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,510
organization called camped here before

80
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,700
we go into the details I wanted to have

81
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,790
this quick legal disclaimer out of the

82
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,679
way I'm not here to present represent

83
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,920
any of my current or previous employers

84
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,549
and all the views presented here are my

85
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:04,540
own and not that of my current or any of

86
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,860
my previous employers now with quick

87
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,970
show of hands how many of you are

88
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:12,790
familiar with Sam thank you

89
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,079
and how many have already use 1.5 or any

90
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:19,029
of the versions before 1.5

91
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,640
thank you so this will help me determine

92
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:24,190
where do I spend more time during my

93
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,729
talk so thank you very much for that the

94
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,620
quick agenda first I'll introduce Sam to

95
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,800
the folks who are not familiar with Sam

96
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:37,030
and we'll talk about the who the ward

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,660
the why and basically the history of

98
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:43,659
this whole project over the last 11

99
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,800
years and after that I'll focus mainly

100
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:51,120
on some of the key highlights of changes

101
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,980
we introduced in Sam version 2.0 or 1.5

102
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,720
once we called that I would like to

103
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,620
spend some time on how do you actually

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,750
apply this model to your organization

105
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:07,960
and then at the end I'll leave some time

106
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:10,390
for questions if you are in any of these

107
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,810
target roles this is our target audience

108
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,940
but essentially if you are involved in

109
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,390
building or maintaining or operating

110
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:22,270
software and infrastructure then this

111
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,039
talk is relevant to you as well as if

112
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,919
you are involved in any shape or form

113
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,390
for security of the software then this

114
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:34,810
talk is relevant to you now who is Sam

115
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:40,150
Sam is particularly to the auto version

116
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:42,310
his hard work of about 14 contributors

117
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,859
across the globe for the past three

118
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:48,370
years now one good thing I like about

119
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:51,490
this team is it's a truly geographically

120
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,320
distributed team it was not by design it

121
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,840
happened to be there lot of contributors

122
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,750
and volunteers joined this project for

123
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,419
the period of time and it really helps

124
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,690
us remove some of the unconscious biases

125
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:07,270
that we might have in terms of either

126
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,750
geography or in terms of the culture

127
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:13,090
things like that the other important

128
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,669
thing I wanted to point out here is the

129
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,520
contributors they also represent small

130
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:20,590
medium and large corporations as well as

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,460
there is at least one professor and

132
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,650
there

133
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:29,650
at least three individuals run their own

134
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,080
Consultancy here so it has view way

135
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,229
diverse view from all different types of

136
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,599
organizations it was very helpful for us

137
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,790
while we are having various debates

138
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,570
while coming up with the new model

139
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:46,690
because we wanted to be make sure that

140
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:50,860
we do not leave any room for any biases

141
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:54,160
and this team has been short that now

142
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,440
what is Sam the Sam is one of the

143
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,970
flagship projects and for those of you

144
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,330
who might not be familiar with all the

145
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,970
whole structure was PES about couple of

146
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,710
hundred projects out of which there is

147
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,630
about fifteen or sixteen projects which

148
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,130
have been given a flagship status and

149
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:14,620
those are the projects which which have

150
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:19,050
strategic value to both wasp as well as

151
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:23,320
to the security apps like in general and

152
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:25,660
Sam is one of those projects it is an

153
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,840
open framework for saw fractions which

154
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,000
provides effective and measurable way

155
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,299
for all different types of organizations

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,630
to analyze and improve the software

157
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,990
security posture that is specific to

158
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,820
that wicker organization and it is

159
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,560
specific to the risks that that

160
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,450
particular organization is facing and

161
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,940
there are many resources that Sam

162
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,710
provides number one it provides a way

163
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,260
for evaluating organization's current

164
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,560
security practices number two it

165
00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:00,010
provides building a way for building a

166
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,070
sufficient program in val defined

167
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:07,080
iterations by creating roadmaps and

168
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:10,480
third it is also providing a way of

169
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,969
providing or at least providing

170
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,640
visibility to the management in terms of

171
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,160
the maturity of your program or the

172
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,860
period of time by providing scorecards

173
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,990
and last but not least it helps

174
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,930
ponderize some of the security

175
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,270
activities that a large organization

176
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,880
needs to be performing because many

177
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,620
times we have come across situations

178
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,240
where different parts of the

179
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,060
organization they might have different

180
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,820
view of what needs to be

181
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:42,598
done at what's maturity level and this

182
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,090
model helps standardize that and it

183
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:50,760
avoids that conversation and confusion

184
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:53,850
within the organization now why do we

185
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,550
need a model like Sam so this is a quick

186
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,880
look at the complexities involved in

187
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,310
this particular tool its organization as

188
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,950
you can see there's many different types

189
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,339
of complexity number one is technology

190
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:14,010
stack some organization might be using

191
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:15,900
Java JavaScript Python Paul Ruby go so

192
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,670
it kind of like power technology stack

193
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,290
it's different type of challenges that

194
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,529
their organization might be facing on

195
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,099
top of that there is also or truck

196
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,779
structural change challenges as well and

197
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,210
third one is more about the deployment

198
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,760
model is it on prime software is it

199
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,520
cloud based software is it mobile first

200
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,610
software is it multiplied from software

201
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,890
how it is deployed is it doctor ready

202
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,930
it is using kubernetes for deployment

203
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:48,300
all of these things adding a layer of

204
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:50,900
complexity on top of that last five

205
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,719
years has also seen tremendous growth in

206
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,750
the open source components being used

207
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,339
while developing software and it also

208
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,080
adds another layer of complexity one of

209
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:08,760
the other additional factor adding the

210
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:11,310
complexity is also the last few years we

211
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,819
have seen tremendous growth of agile and

212
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:17,790
DevOps model and it also adds complexity

213
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,089
because in agile and DevOps there is a

214
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,490
lot more focus on the speed of delivery

215
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:26,390
and as you can see in this triangle

216
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,190
which is constantly a tension between

217
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:32,689
quality cost and speed of delivery and

218
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:36,300
most of time in this tension quality

219
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:39,920
loses which results into security well a

220
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,020
breeze if you look at any of the latest

221
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,800
breaches major bridges like Equifax

222
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,899
or recently Capital One

223
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,229
they are mostly related to the

224
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:52,510
application security so past 15 years we

225
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,390
have seen this tremendous change from

226
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,399
parameter based security to so each

227
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,100
parameter based security monopolies to

228
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,130
more of applications specific

229
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,950
vulnerabilities and as a result of all

230
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,709
this complexity we need a model which

231
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,750
have standardized or at least abstract

232
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,869
out some of this complexity and

233
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:18,790
standardize the software assurance

234
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:21,910
maturity levels I also like this quote

235
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,910
from one of the great statistical minds

236
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,399
of 20th century George box as per George

237
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:30,250
box the most that can be expected from

238
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:34,180
any model is that it can supply a useful

239
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:37,089
approximation to the reality and most of

240
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:40,209
the models are wrong some models are

241
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:43,060
useful and Sam wants to be that model

242
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:45,939
Sam is that model which is close enough

243
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,310
to the reality there cannot be any model

244
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,490
which is very specifically exactly

245
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:54,239
matching organization and that's a

246
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,310
reason Sam understands that and

247
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,910
recognizes that and builds in that level

248
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,550
of abstraction so that it can be close

249
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:07,480
enough to reality and it is still useful

250
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,550
model Sam is also measurable by which

251
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,490
determines maturity levels across

252
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,529
different business practices it is

253
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,640
actionable it provides clear-cut

254
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:21,880
pathways for improving the maturity of

255
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,370
your software security and it is

256
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,950
versatile and this is where I would like

257
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,930
to spend a little more time so this is

258
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,649
where in the earlier slide we mentioned

259
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:34,800
about the all different technology and

260
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:38,649
organization and all the process related

261
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,589
complexities Sam is versatile enough so

262
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:43,690
that it can abstract our out all the

263
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,000
complexity and it can still provide

264
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:49,540
useful approximation to the reality of

265
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,430
your organization so it is useful in no

266
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,020
matter what type of organization you are

267
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,900
in

268
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,620
one of the biggest benefits of Sam is

269
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,390
also it is vendor-neutral so anyone can

270
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,480
join this project and they can

271
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,360
contribute the partnerships and ideas to

272
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:12,090
this project it is not dictated by any

273
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,590
one particular company or organization

274
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,320
now let's look at some of the core

275
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,150
principles of Sam one of the first one

276
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,380
is organizations maturity and the

277
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,730
behavior changes slowly over time

278
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,680
changes must be iterative while working

279
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,720
towards long term goals this is why I

280
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,599
would like to take back journey to my

281
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,290
expense bootstrapping his project

282
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,020
reprogram we what I thought initially is

283
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:41,020
like hey I will be done in like a year

284
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,670
and here they are like I laugh VMC but

285
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,100
they're still working on the iterations

286
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:48,939
after the iterations the key thing over

287
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,240
there is it still provides that level of

288
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:56,530
maturity and it kind of keeps on moving

289
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,080
the needle every quarter every year the

290
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,610
second principle is there is no single

291
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,730
recipe that works for all the

292
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,590
organizations and the reason for that is

293
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,570
each organization has different business

294
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,990
drivers and different risks that they

295
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:13,840
face and your solution must be

296
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,430
risk-based that's the reason there is no

297
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,990
single recipe which works for other

298
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,370
organizations now I myself work for two

299
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,640
different types of organizations in my

300
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,370
career enterprise software companies and

301
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,870
consumer based software companies and I

302
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,740
could see clearly the distinction

303
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,980
between the two the business drivers and

304
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,410
the risk profile was very different in

305
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,200
enterprise versus consumer focusing

306
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,819
companies the third principle is

307
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,520
guidance related to security activists

308
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,940
must be prescriptive so it can make

309
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,470
sense to anyone who is not very close

310
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,410
enough to security you don't need to be

311
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:56,170
a security expert to use this model or

312
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,040
even understand this model and last but

313
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,860
not least

314
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,250
overall this model must be simple

315
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,500
well-defined and

316
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,630
I would like to stress the words simple

317
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,990
there many times we had discussions

318
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:11,930
during version 200 where when we wanted

319
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,080
to design our next iteration of the

320
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,060
maturity model or the measurement model

321
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,100
we thought about adding weight edge to

322
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,619
different security activities and it

323
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,870
quickly became very complicated and one

324
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,480
of the key thing was it all soared

325
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,970
almost double the time it would take to

326
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,010
do the assessment same assessment as a

327
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,810
result we went back to the drawing board

328
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,330
and we say hey whatever core principles

329
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,390
and we say oh okay one of the core

330
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:41,630
principles is simplicity so we wanted to

331
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:43,939
keep that simplicity in mind as a result

332
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:47,150
we remove that weight edge criteria is

333
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:51,260
one of the aspects for the new

334
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:54,140
measurement model now a little bit

335
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,990
history about this project this project

336
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,819
started as open Sam initiative I led by

337
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,490
one of the independent software security

338
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,770
consultant provisions Rob back in 2009

339
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,670
and the first version was made available

340
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:10,310
by the donation from 45 software however

341
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:13,640
after that for almost six years there

342
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:16,880
was not much new version or improvement

343
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,160
to this model and it became stagnant so

344
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,230
group of people at was came together and

345
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,199
decided to bring some life to this

346
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,980
project as a result they came up with

347
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,040
version 1.1 by for King creating a fork

348
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,560
out of this open same project and in

349
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,569
version 1.1 did not she drastically

350
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,290
change the model however at the same

351
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,990
time what version 1.1 did is expanded

352
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:45,199
this model to provide more resources and

353
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:48,560
guidance so that more people can adopt

354
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,960
Sam some of the examples of the guidance

355
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,829
and resources that they provided in 1.1

356
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,770
was around how to guide Quick Start

357
00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:01,700
Guide the core model and last but not

358
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:04,400
least toolbox which is which is the most

359
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,130
useful of all the different resources

360
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,839
which helps provide data collection for

361
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,890
doing your assessment same assessment

362
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:14,448
and also provides way for coming up with

363
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,399
the matrix and graphs

364
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:20,380
charge related to the other activities

365
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:23,629
in Sam now I joined right after that and

366
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,100
at the point we decided like you know

367
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,709
there are several challenges we wanted

368
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,870
to tackle how are we focused on the

369
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:32,330
measurement model challenge which was

370
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,330
pretty much binary yes and no by that

371
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,639
time so any security activity it asks

372
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,740
you the question are you performing this

373
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:42,830
security activity and the answers were

374
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,600
either yes or no and as we all live in

375
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,689
the real world there is no binary answer

376
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,939
most of the time so as a result we added

377
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:53,750
a lot more granularity to the questions

378
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:57,230
and the assessment answers and that

379
00:17:53,750 --> 00:18:00,080
really helped with assessments after

380
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:04,159
that we recently launched in January

381
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,730
2020 new version of Sam in this model

382
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,279
what we did was we continue to improve

383
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,960
the measurement model at the same time

384
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:16,279
we also made some structural changes

385
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,559
because over the last decade the DevOps

386
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:21,909
and agile became more mainstream than

387
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,549
the waterfall back in 2009 when origins

388
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:27,440
open Sam was created so we wanted to add

389
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,450
what more guidance related to that in

390
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,779
the model and we wanted to add some of

391
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,360
the prescriptive guidance related to

392
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:38,600
some of the other areas which alcohol a

393
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,840
bit later as a result Sam to dato is not

394
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:47,029
backward-compatible 21.5 and its

395
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,980
predecessors now let's look at the

396
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:51,880
different maturity levels and here I

397
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,110
want to stress one important aspect that

398
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,159
Rachel also mention in the today's

399
00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:00,350
keynote presentation we not all the

400
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,720
organization need to be at level 3 in

401
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:05,809
all different security practices in fact

402
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,090
I would argue that it would not be the

403
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:11,210
best use of your limited security

404
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:13,459
resources if you try to accomplish the

405
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,340
highest level in all security practices

406
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,740
across all the different business

407
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,629
practices in this model what you really

408
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,840
need to do is you really need to assess

409
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,840
your organization's business driver your

410
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,209
organization's risk profile and come

411
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,939
target maturity model for your

412
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:36,020
organization that is where it will be

413
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:38,450
the most useful use of this model now

414
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,879
let's take a little deeper dive into

415
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:44,030
some of the changes that we made in the

416
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,490
measurement model of 1.5 as you can see

417
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:49,820
they're like four different dimensions

418
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:52,760
now or measurement levels that we have

419
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,850
instead of just two years and know why

420
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,560
we did that is if we take a look at one

421
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,290
of the example of the assessment

422
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:03,139
question it will make more sense so if

423
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,090
you answer the question have you in the

424
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,340
educational guidance practice security

425
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,939
practice if you look at one of the

426
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,220
assessment question which is asking have

427
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,460
you trained everybody involved in

428
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,550
software development to the specific

429
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,980
security training now earlier versions

430
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:24,169
the answers were yes and no the

431
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,760
challenge and the dilemma or there was

432
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:30,890
if you want say yes you are having

433
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,110
trouble down the road when you say to

434
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:36,410
just train your developers but you want

435
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,330
to train now QA engineers your project

436
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,120
managers your product managers and

437
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,040
various other roles you will have tough

438
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,050
time justifying a budget because then

439
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,790
your management will look at it like hey

440
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,980
you already answered yes and you got

441
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,810
full credit now you're not moving the

442
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,900
needle so you will not get the budget

443
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:55,370
and if you answer no then you are not

444
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,640
getting the credit for the work you are

445
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:02,090
doing as a result we added this to new

446
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,760
dimensions whew or some and at least

447
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,620
half I would also like to point out that

448
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,920
the one in order to get the level one

449
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:13,280
maturity we also may change too many or

450
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,290
most because in today's real world it's

451
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,320
very difficult to do something across

452
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:21,470
all the projects or across the

453
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,570
organization so man your MOS is specific

454
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,730
to your organization's risk and business

455
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,980
driver there's always going to be some

456
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,290
legacy software which you are about to

457
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,360
retire in six months that probably

458
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,940
doesn't make sense to invest a whole lot

459
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,510
of resources so that is the reason and

460
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:42,930
rationale behind giving major

461
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:50,440
one for meetings many or most of this

462
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:52,570
Security's criteria now I want to dwell

463
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,840
on this particular slide but this is a

464
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:58,000
quick look at version 1.5 the one thing

465
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,669
I would like to point out here is at

466
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,800
high level there for business functions

467
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,810
which are related to the nuts and bolts

468
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,730
of this offered an open organization and

469
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:12,820
each business function has three

470
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:16,090
security practices now one would ask

471
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,730
what are the motivations behind this new

472
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:21,490
version why did you have to make changes

473
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:24,040
and come up with a new version 2.0 which

474
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,750
is also not backward-compatible and

475
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,420
these are the main reasons first and

476
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,970
foremost is we wanted to align with

477
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,160
recent development methodologies agile

478
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,320
and DevOps which is kind of like

479
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,630
becoming a mainstream Moyles already

480
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,649
became mainstream in last five to ten

481
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:43,540
years and earlier version did not have

482
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:46,300
that that's why we wanted to have that

483
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,490
alignment and by adding that even though

484
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,320
the earlier versions were not specific

485
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,330
to just waterfall model the

486
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,780
interpretation in the community was such

487
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:58,780
that so we wanted to make it development

488
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:01,180
methodology agnostic the second one is

489
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,180
more about improving the measurement

490
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,310
model again now one would ask like we

491
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:10,780
just changed the measurement model in

492
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:12,720
1.5 what's changing again so 1.5

493
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,889
definitely addressed some of the

494
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,740
challenges related to the granularity

495
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,750
level of the model measurement model

496
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,570
however it still did not answer the

497
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,720
question how well an organization is

498
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:28,000
performing certain security activity and

499
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,130
that is another thing which we change by

500
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,900
adding a qualitative criteria to the

501
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:35,350
measurement model

502
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:38,409
the third one is we wanted to avoid or

503
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:42,850
fund and unrelated activities in

504
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:45,360
different maturity models so I'll give

505
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,370
one example in SEM 1.5 version

506
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,580
code-signing was somewhere around level

507
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:54,219
two and there was no related activity at

508
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,289
level one or level three thus creating

509
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,570
is more like an orphan activity and

510
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:01,900
there was no consistent three across

511
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:04,389
base levels as a security practitioners

512
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:07,120
and same practitioners ourselves we

513
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:10,169
realized that and even more funny thing

514
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,760
is the earlier version there was

515
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:15,309
sometimes easier there are instances

516
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,860
where it was easier to accomplish level

517
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:20,649
three activity with relative ease

518
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:24,309
compared to level one or level two so it

519
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:27,039
really didn't make sense because as you

520
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:28,928
go higher in your maturity level the

521
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,450
cost of implementation should be higher

522
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:34,270
so there was another motivation behind

523
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,770
changing this model and last but not

524
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,408
least we also wanted to improve the

525
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,840
production process so Sam itself was

526
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:42,460
more waterfall II the way we are

527
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,889
releasing the version so we wanted to

528
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,380
make it a lot more automated that is

529
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,299
what we are trying to do so that we can

530
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:54,220
come up with more frequent and smaller

531
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:56,049
releases of Sam now this is version 2.0

532
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:59,620
and I would like to spend a little more

533
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:01,809
time on this particular slide so at high

534
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:05,678
level it's to has Sam is a three level

535
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:07,990
maturity model at highest level their

536
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,080
business functions and we enter his

537
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:14,409
fifth business function and this is for

538
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,559
the reason we mentioned earlier that the

539
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:20,860
same version 1.5 and earlier did not

540
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:24,850
have anything related to any guidance

541
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:27,610
related to either build or deployment

542
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:30,158
which is how a critical part of today's

543
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,750
modernization which is living a

544
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,200
breathing continuous integration

545
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,940
continuous deployment model that is the

546
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,789
reason we added this fifth business

547
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,820
function called implementation we also

548
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:45,160
make just a rename one of the

549
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,010
business functions from construction to

550
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,250
design to make it more suitable to

551
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:52,360
software development organizations

552
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,110
underneath each business function we

553
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:58,840
still have three security practices and

554
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:01,780
what we change in addition to that is in

555
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,459
order to provide that linkage between

556
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,030
different maturity levels of security

557
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:10,060
practices we created security streams

558
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:12,370
which I'll call a bit later now if you

559
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,649
look at the Gaughan's business function

560
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,540
it is looking at more critical aspects

561
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:20,530
and strategic aspects of your program

562
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:23,399
itself and the waste methodologies that

563
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:26,260
you are using like strategy in matrix

564
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,090
policy in compliance education guidance

565
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:33,040
which is more or less applicable

566
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:35,080
throughout the whole model while design

567
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,360
implementation verification and

568
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,220
operations is more related to the

569
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,439
software development methodology that

570
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,100
your vision like we feel I might be

571
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,900
following now look at design business

572
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,300
functional design business function

573
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,890
there is a threat assessment security

574
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,470
requirements and security architecture

575
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:56,680
so threat assessment is again where we

576
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,930
made some changes we one would have to

577
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,870
look at your organization's risk profile

578
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:04,600
and come up with a threat modeling so

579
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:07,090
that is another change that we made as

580
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,389
part of design and secure requirements

581
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,929
and architectures have similar to the

582
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,550
earlier versions as I mentioned earlier

583
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:18,160
implementation has now secured build and

584
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:22,090
secure deployment which is a main focus

585
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,370
and the defect management was there but

586
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,500
it was considered as issue management it

587
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:29,649
was in some different business functions

588
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,870
so we have consolidated everything to

589
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:35,350
the defects that your organization's are

590
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:39,330
finding in various phases of software

591
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:42,790
development lifecycle now fourth one is

592
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:45,990
verification which is taking care of the

593
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:49,690
security testing and verification and

594
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:52,030
design review aspects of your software

595
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,510
development lifecycle and last but not

596
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:57,010
least is operations in operations

597
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,660
mainly incident management and

598
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,970
environment management are the key

599
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,640
changes where incident management

600
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:06,760
provides guidance related to how to

601
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,490
detect and respond to an incident at the

602
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,030
same time environment management is more

603
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:16,480
about how do you create that baseline by

604
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:19,720
providing hardening guides and on top of

605
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,000
that how do you update your software in

606
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:27,540
the operational environment by patching

607
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,690
and upgrading now let's take a look a

608
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:34,690
closer look at security practices ecq

609
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:37,690
practices now something called streams

610
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:41,740
there are two streams in ecq practice

611
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:44,110
stream a and stream B now the rationale

612
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,410
behind this is we wanted to create that

613
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:49,209
linkage between different security

614
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,970
practices and activities between

615
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,580
different models that's the reason we

616
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,560
created this two different links and it

617
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,560
is also providing consistent theme

618
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:05,770
across security activities at various

619
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:08,440
levels let's take a closer look at

620
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:11,400
requirements driven testing so as you

621
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:15,880
can see there are two main objectives

622
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:18,550
for each stream so stream a is their

623
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,070
objective is control verification and

624
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,950
stream B is objective is misuse and

625
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:27,490
abuse testing and as you can see as you

626
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:29,200
go higher in maturity level the cost of

627
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,090
implementation for this particular

628
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,210
security activities is becoming also

629
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:36,220
higher so this is where we fixed those

630
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,520
structural changes or structural

631
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,370
elements of this model where Sam's

632
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,370
predecessor versions two got was

633
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:48,129
versions it was lacking where we did not

634
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,810
have that consistent theme across

635
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,540
various security activities across

636
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:55,540
different levels and the cost of

637
00:29:52,540 --> 00:30:02,080
implementation was not higher as you go

638
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:04,600
down the maturity levels this is a quick

639
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,510
summary of changes we made in Sam

640
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,040
version 2.0 I caught most of the changes

641
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:12,850
I would like to focus on

642
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,220
the last bullet here on quality criteria

643
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,949
so and this is where again going back to

644
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:21,190
the maturity and measurement model

645
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:24,250
changes so for measurement model we had

646
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:27,340
volume debates among the contributors

647
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:30,610
and practitioners and one of the key

648
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,740
thing that we came up with is in order

649
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:35,740
to assess how well an object is

650
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:39,160
performing certain activity we added

651
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:43,000
quality criteria and at the same time we

652
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,560
or goal was to not double the time it

653
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,880
would take to do the assessment same

654
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:52,240
assessments so what we did is we added

655
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,910
quality criteria to the questions to the

656
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,540
coverage questions so and I'll go into a

657
00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:01,180
little bit details a little later where

658
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,310
I'll show an example where the quality

659
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,520
criteria are now part of the coverage

660
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:08,080
question so if you're answering one of

661
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,629
the crowd or some of the quality

662
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:16,629
criteria are not meeting you will simply

663
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:19,480
get zero coverage now let's take a look

664
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:23,230
at how do you apply this model in your

665
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:26,380
opposition this is a very typical

666
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:29,740
approach we you go through this phases

667
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:33,220
and cycle of preparation doing the

668
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:36,550
assessment studying the target creating

669
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:39,760
you plan implementation and rollout and

670
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:42,669
again back to assessment and creating a

671
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,300
plan and implementation rollouts thus

672
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:48,640
creating this more of a cyclic process

673
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:53,230
the most important portion over here is

674
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:57,100
preparation as Richard mentioned over

675
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:59,980
here in the teen would speak that one of

676
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,939
the most important aspect of initiating

677
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:06,490
the sikri program is getting the buy-in

678
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,780
from the key stakeholders so this is

679
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,390
exactly what you do during the

680
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:14,200
preparation phase once you are starting

681
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:16,210
some implementation forcing and foremost

682
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,870
thing what you need to do is identify

683
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,660
the scope

684
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,850
is the scope of your same assessment and

685
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:26,150
implementation is across the whole

686
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:29,120
organization or it is going to be across

687
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:31,880
one bu or multiple bu within the

688
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,820
organization or it is just limited to

689
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:40,580
one or two projects and applications

690
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:42,830
with some business unit so defining the

691
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,020
scope is the most critical because once

692
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,810
you define the scope it will help you

693
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:52,190
identify your key stakeholders it takes

694
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:54,080
very different level of buy-in to do Sam

695
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,060
at the organizational level versus at

696
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,580
the business unit level versus at the

697
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,800
project level so once you determine your

698
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:04,460
scope you identify your key stakeholders

699
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:09,230
and then you start start to get buy-in

700
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:11,240
from them for rolling out Sam and one of

701
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,130
the other important aspects here is you

702
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,580
need to show them the benefits that you

703
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:22,400
will be reaping as a result of going

704
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:25,490
through this Sam now this particular

705
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,280
aspect of Sam is the most important

706
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:30,760
aspect conducting assessments this phase

707
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,950
I consider as more like a Trojan horse

708
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,440
once you have somebody either your

709
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:39,370
business unit or your project team or

710
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,410
the whole organization once they start

711
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:45,560
doing the assessment it will give them a

712
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:47,780
scorecard which once you get the

713
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,210
scorecard it have creates more of a

714
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,800
healthy competition among different

715
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,920
business units different project teams

716
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,500
within your organization and that

717
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,630
healthy competition is very helpful in

718
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,790
driving the improvements that you want

719
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:05,660
to drive in your software assurance

720
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:08,270
maturity model so this is one of the

721
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,700
most important aspect of Sam is

722
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:12,350
conducting assessment now how do you

723
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:15,020
conduct assessment is basically

724
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:18,350
conducting interviews with some of these

725
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:21,199
key stakeholders that you identify and I

726
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,969
would not recommend that you just send

727
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,699
your assessment questions over the email

728
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:28,159
or over the slack I would recommend

729
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,919
rather you take an approach where you

730
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,170
collaborate

731
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,340
with that team and you work with that

732
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:38,370
team to understand the security packages

733
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:40,970
that they're performing which is very

734
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:44,130
helpful in kind of coming work with

735
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:45,899
assessment model or assessment level for

736
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,410
that particular business unit or

737
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:51,870
audition or that particular project team

738
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:54,449
now they in fact three ways of

739
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:57,000
performing the assessments one is a

740
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:58,770
lightweight assessment and the second

741
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,870
one is more detailed assessment so what

742
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:04,590
is the difference the lightweight is

743
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:07,470
mainly about you just have the interview

744
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:10,200
you trust the person you're interviewing

745
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:13,649
and you assign the assessment level

746
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,009
accordingly so that is where you won't

747
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:18,540
ask for proofs or evidence of whether

748
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:21,780
you are doing certain activity security

749
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,610
activity or not while detail assessment

750
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,820
is the assessment where for each and

751
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:30,950
every claim that they are making of

752
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:34,380
performing certain activity you ask for

753
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,180
evidence and you review the evidence you

754
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,580
collect the evidence review the evidence

755
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:42,149
and based on that you come up with the

756
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:46,470
assessment and the maturity levels for

757
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:48,630
that particular project what I have

758
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:51,810
found most useful is a hybrid approach

759
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,010
between the two if you know if you are

760
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,920
part of the organization you already

761
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:59,340
know if for example if somebody says hey

762
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,850
I'm doing static advances when you don't

763
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:04,620
even provide licenses then you know that

764
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:08,220
somewhere it is not true and vice-versa

765
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:10,319
as well right so this is where you take

766
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,649
the hybrid approach where you only ask

767
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,210
for evidence when you in doubt or if

768
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,460
they are in doubt because they might be

769
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,100
performing activity at certain maturity

770
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:23,100
level but they might not be able to

771
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,930
determine by themselves what should be

772
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,000
the answer for the assessment question

773
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:30,330
and there is where you ask for evidence

774
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,880
and look at it review it and again set

775
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,860
up a time for them and discuss the most

776
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,990
important thing over here is to explain

777
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,810
them a rationale they need to buy in

778
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,109
they need to understand why you give

779
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,509
what school you gave

780
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:48,700
and that will help them come up with a

781
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:50,140
plan for improving the maturity so this

782
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,250
is a quick example of how do you

783
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:56,830
calculate the maturity score as you can

784
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,620
see there are two streams here for a

785
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:02,290
security activity and basically what you

786
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,299
do is for each level you take the

787
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,870
average between stream a and stream B

788
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,970
activity and add it to the next level

789
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:15,160
average that's how you calculate this

790
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:17,470
maturity score in the new model the next

791
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,930
phase is basically setting this target

792
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,299
this is where you need to define the

793
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:24,220
target as per the business key business

794
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,430
drivers and the risk your organization

795
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,839
is facing please do not copy other

796
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,120
organizations and this is where I've

797
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,280
seen many of the folks are making this

798
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,930
mistake they say hey the organization

799
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,860
axe is doing this so I need to start

800
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,779
doing that as well

801
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,750
please do not do that because their

802
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:43,030
business drivers and risk might be very

803
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,130
different from yours that's why I set

804
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:48,430
the target as per your organization's

805
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:52,350
business drivers and risk profile unique

806
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:55,299
to you and estimate the cost because

807
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:58,029
doing all this same related activities

808
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,850
will cost your organization over five to

809
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:01,420
ten percent higher cost of course it's

810
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,299
not free

811
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:09,670
so I submit that cause that will help

812
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:12,130
you create reasonable plan and that

813
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,940
leads to the next phase which is

814
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:18,490
defining the plan you work with your

815
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,940
team and identify the next release or

816
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:23,709
next changes so patchily is minor

817
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,860
release busy release whatever it could

818
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:32,790
be and create a plan which is conducive

819
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,790
to the development team's next releases

820
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:37,930
Sam also provides some of the tools

821
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:41,080
where it will help you create that

822
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:44,799
roadmap and the roadmap needs to be

823
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:47,740
created in various phases we recommend

824
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,630
it should be in around four or max five

825
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,029
phases don't roll it out in like more

826
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:54,270
than five phases and also don't roll it

827
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:57,850
out in less than three phases

828
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,620
once you and each phase also should be

829
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:02,290
somewhere between three to 12 months

830
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,450
long so this way you are creating

831
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:08,640
basically three to five years roadmap

832
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,640
for your organization security maturity

833
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,350
yeah one of the most important point I

834
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:18,160
want to drive home you start with the

835
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:20,230
high impact activities I would recommend

836
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,779
training awareness and threat assessment

837
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,390
these are the two set of activities

838
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:28,660
which are most impactful for any

839
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,730
organization so you should recommend you

840
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,040
to start with most of the high impact

841
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:37,210
activities in the earlier phases and you

842
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,320
can build upon the momentum once you

843
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,960
have planned

844
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,780
you start implementation the

845
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,310
implementation there is a guide that we

846
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,850
provide to help you with the

847
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:50,799
implementation in addition to that os

848
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:54,330
also provides lot of different projects

849
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,730
there about 200 projects you know us and

850
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:59,470
we provide this kind of like wasp is

851
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,890
more of like aspiring to become more of

852
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,930
like an umbrella of Ottawa's projects so

853
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,549
if you can see I did quick mapping

854
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:09,399
between some of the this is just for

855
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,490
example projects there are many more are

856
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,290
there good projects under awesome River

857
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:15,850
what I would recommend is look at all

858
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,740
the was project and see which one that

859
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:21,370
you would like to implement or used

860
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:25,270
during your implementation and any of

861
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:27,279
this project would map it back to at

862
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:30,400
least one security one or more security

863
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,280
activities and business function at high

864
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,880
level so this is a mapping that I came

865
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,120
up with but there is there is a lot of

866
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,640
other help in Osprey I would recommend

867
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:46,990
you to go and visit us web page where

868
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:50,350
you will find all different projects Sam

869
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:53,950
also defines this different guidelines

870
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:55,569
per level in the guide that we have

871
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,279
version 2 taught of guide that we have

872
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:00,040
so please take a look at that

873
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,070
and also make sure that you understand

874
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,710
all of these things before you start the

875
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:07,020
implementation the last phase is more of

876
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,270
a roll out we

877
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,640
what you're doing is you're continuously

878
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:13,110
creating yeah passes and demonstrating

879
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,540
and communicating the improvement that

880
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,130
you are made in the earlier version so

881
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,880
this is where it's more of a cyclic

882
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,500
approach where you identify the

883
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,380
improvements that you made in this

884
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:29,010
particular one cycle of improvement and

885
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:31,740
you communicate it's very important to

886
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:34,620
communicate the good results that you

887
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:37,770
are producing with this changes through

888
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,980
Sam so once you have communicated to

889
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:42,960
your management all these improvements

890
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:46,440
you will get even more buy-in from them

891
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,900
for the next iteration of Sam so this

892
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,650
will it will create this constant loop

893
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:55,140
or a cycle of improvements and it goes

894
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:58,080
back to one of the key core principles

895
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:01,529
of Sam that organization behavior does

896
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:05,490
not change or night it takes time to

897
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:07,140
make all these changes these are some of

898
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:10,290
the other available resources for

899
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,580
rolling out Sami organization if you

900
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,710
don't remember anything at least

901
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:17,430
remember the main website of the Sam

902
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:20,700
it's Sam tautology please make sure it's

903
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,470
not open Sam it's Sam dot o-r-g this is

904
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,259
where all the other resources are

905
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:28,830
available I would also like to point out

906
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:31,290
to folks who are using 1.5 ojun that is

907
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:33,750
also a mapping between version 1.5 and

908
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:37,020
2.2 available so please to take a look

909
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:39,690
at that as well even though Sam 2.0 is

910
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,880
not backward-compatible at least you

911
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,100
will understand if you are in a perform

912
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,470
on point 5 assessment where some of the

913
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,950
security activities might have to dot oh

914
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,580
one more thing

915
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:56,399
Sam benchmarking initially what is it so

916
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,620
it is now time to ask the question how

917
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,960
do I compare with other organizations

918
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,730
and this is where we are rolling out

919
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,050
this initiative to start collecting data

920
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:09,330
from different vendors different

921
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:11,160
independent organizations doing

922
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,600
third-party assessment as well as some

923
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,339
of the other organizations doing the

924
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,709
assessment themselves

925
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:18,900
this will help us answer the question

926
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:22,229
how does my organization compare with

927
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:24,119
the other organizations and one of the

928
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:26,910
key thing is also there'll be an option

929
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,219
to send anonymous data so that if you

930
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:31,499
won't want to associate your name or

931
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:33,180
your company's name there will be an

932
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:34,240
option to I don't know I sent the

933
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,129
anonymous data as well

934
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,439
[Music]

935
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:43,410
future direction we would like to have

936
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:48,868
more faster iterative versions of Sam's

937
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:51,118
in the future like 2.1 2.2 22.3 etc the

938
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:52,920
references for their worst projects so

939
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,089
Sam being that umbrella project and

940
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:01,199
these aspiration to come up with online

941
00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:03,930
assessment and roadmaps so all in all my

942
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:07,529
call to action call for action is if you

943
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:09,629
haven't tried Sam yet please try it as

944
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:12,749
somebody said the proof of the pudding

945
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:16,229
is it in eating the pudding so please

946
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:19,229
try Sam and if you have any feedback or

947
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:21,739
questions Sam is more of a open forum so

948
00:44:19,229 --> 00:44:25,189
you can always provide us a feedback and

949
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:28,109
you can also be part of the same project

950
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:30,959
with that I would like to thank beside

951
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:33,058

and sponsors and if you have any

953
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:38,519
