[Music]

7
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:37,190
please want that usually random company

8
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:37,190
like that forgivable fortune without 10%

9
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:47,340
to show that company about the our main

10
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,268
funding contribution real cost them

11
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,690
their actual profit highly our personal

12
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,540
that

13
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:59,150
so then globally just pop that phone

14
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,150
numbers devices

15
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:28,490
so this is anything coined by Daniel oh

16
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:34,040
he is - he is highly respected art

17
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:36,000
scholar the definition of visual mark

18
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,100
recent news the fact that all of our

19
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,090
information being collected is creating

20
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:45,810
an online document come without our

21
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:48,390
consent so a little of it says it is

22
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,360
tality of Information Act created

23
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,169
together that specific problem

24
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,140
consolidating various bits of

25
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,780
information each ended in itself is

26
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,860
relatively went on for me however a

27
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,859
Canada advocate

28
00:06:52,199 --> 00:07:43,530

31
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:26,940
there are also images to education

32
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:26,940
royalty business I put this quote this

33
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:33,059
is not not for a reason for that

34
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:43,299
pfftt and privacy guard issue so the

35
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:53,230
fact they were not that and I think it's

36
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:55,000
I actually there's nothing wrong with

37
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,070
these businesses collecting our

38
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,589
information or all about ethical

39
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:09,610
collection allows us to interrupt out

40
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:14,160
control the company and take by the

41
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,160
issue with smaller media businesses they

42
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,689
rightly ordered small company and

43
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:26,729
they're let the information about paying

44
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:32,890
ethical ethical practices in policy

45
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:35,230
today to make sure that outraged any

46
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,040
event that with each other and almost in

47
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:41,290
my thought you believe that when

48
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,110
consumers understand there's no other

49
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:47,140
information collected the likelihood

50
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,330
think she's outraged and stop doing that

51
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,430
product or service well it's less

52
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:55,839
because they are you cutting three she

53
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:57,729
managed independently disease so this

54
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,230
kind of homes within for the importance

55
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,230
of Russian

56
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,399
[Music]

57
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,490
so

58
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,850
[Applause]

[Applause]

62
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:51,730
so a way to implement all the privacy by

63
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,610
design simply means that when you are

64
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,440
designing the product you are thinking

65
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:04,170
about privacy other

66
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:08,310
product line corrector privacy by

67
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,810
default future privacy even setting to

68
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,670
the design of the product

69
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,920
maybe that's fully functional surgery

70
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:33,560
and all the differences in Susan's but

71
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:33,560
with what not just how to greet that

72
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,319
fire inside to you privacy preferences

73
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,780
trying to just completely can can to

74
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,350
figure out how much information before I

75
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:49,860
look and opt-in opt-out for really good

76
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:53,130
at best I feel like you are creating a

77
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,130
useful product or service can't see were

78
00:14:53,130 --> 00:15:00,930
in that you can find its opt-in after

79
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:03,210
collecting data particularly the data

80
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,370
can use for anything enrich should

81
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:08,610
notify the individual Ferguson inference

82
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,710
and impossible at the part that once

83
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,280
again too often opt out and imprint is

84
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,030
included

85
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:21,150
now that inspiration I was talking about

86
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:22,410
and the GPS tracking crystal increase

87
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:26,220
their breakthrough summit bragging

88
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:30,600
disclose that I hate people only notice

89
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,340
I've seen overseas but should put the

90
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:39,210
information in there you means that you

91
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:41,550
try to the individual to choose not to

92
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,680
to choose or not to choose in that

93
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,810
product has been more so true when

94
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,609
you're allowing the options popped out

95
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:53,189
of relationships or contacts I mean just

96
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,510
allow them options to select what

97
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,200
information they want to share how I

98
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,069
said anything

99
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:03,890
see you know anything white people share

100
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:03,890
a lot for work so

101
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,589
[Music]

102
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,130
not always business purposes and it's

103
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,240
crazy

104
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,480
I did not what to use snapchat

105
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:27,580
metallation

106
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:29,590
all the time so I can either I have to

107
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,600
personally track all the information

108
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,300
that we didn't do it last year I that

109
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,740
lose momentum I mean I'll seem to like

110
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:40,930
forgetting to turn it on reluctant and a

111
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,340
little now alerts like quick book that's

112
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,040
traveler locations we ran out of time

113
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:48,310
for us and then just like and you know

114
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,980
what turn it off the port and I just

115
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:53,050
truly I understand the value and skin

116
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,810
Buddha privacy both just you know what

117
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,329
or who they can share it and it's just

118
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,459
so first everyone to assume so you

119
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,200
wouldn't have staying there company to

120
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,500
love these

121
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,370
I guess the decision-makers nobody

122
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,410
providing not either because they

123
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:15,659
understand by the war and find that you

124
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:24,360
opt into it important to be the perfect

125
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:24,360
opportunity to control limit contusion

126
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:31,870
your top it means don't just have

127
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,590
anything burst out of nap don't just

128
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:38,739
have it so that you can hop that are off

129
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,720
outfit like do it equipment probably zip

130
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,760
them up trying to connect your boat

131
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,740
probably some hell up ever at time

132
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,780
you're trying to find some contacts or

133
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,840
show your location at the time of its

134
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:53,080
development that's what it's about

135
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:59,820
consumer can understand the earth pop up

136
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,820
allowing so

137
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:07,900
the data used to make critical decisions

138
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:10,030
nice benefits like insurance upon the

139
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:14,740
German see of what increasing increasing

140
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:17,230
their rates big guards to make sure the

141
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,600
information is accurate you're

142
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,530
increasing my freedom and it's just

143
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,480
another test accomplished for their

144
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,940
comeback that drive and the information

145
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,390
is what is incorrect something in this

146
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,330
Metro huge this entire screen it's for

147
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:43,060
me it's not only because of I gotta

148
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:46,899
because of endurance we're not quick

149
00:18:43,060 --> 00:19:14,610
either concerns so allow an opportunity

150
00:18:46,900 --> 00:19:14,610
to see so things to consider

151
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:37,870
so what does and not everyone access to

152
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:42,370
all that needs their chart and a lot of

153
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:44,379
their process between the navigating

154
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,030
share at the slope we all know that a

155
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:50,010
lot of parties a lot of organizations

156
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,010
like work with burdens of us fine

157
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:01,580
Travel the data kept and how it's the

158
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:10,630
show how it's the story the reason event

159
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:24,500
climate control that how about that how

160
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:38,330
to acid export things to do today when

161
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:40,610
it comes to chance to kind of cement I

162
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,669
don't think I've ever actually CMAs and

163
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,919
applications where they use it allow you

164
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:49,930
have choice of white fish we provided

165
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,930
really over long to control how the

166
00:20:52,120 --> 00:21:03,370
students assume early applied content of

167
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:06,950
your app out of entire data collection

168
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:11,800
yeah I got tired entirely of luckier

practicing what we share my perspective

on that it's where they're willing to

share return when we share it it's not

198

going to fly anymore so how do we

199

protect them how to target that part our

consumers rather than just bottled

201
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:05,989

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:48,220

00:26:48,220 --> 00:27:02,140
people's personal data so I don't know I

219
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,700
just don't think I understand why we

would be a vendor got to go but I don't

think so this for one of our trades

shy at all I'm only have to see if

223
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:14,110
they're actually after I think rather

224
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:16,659
than try to regulate this or scare oh I

225
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:19,000
think you just to let these businesses

226
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,560
know it's our information that we hear

227
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,350
about it that we are not standing for

228
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:28,600
and then they can hopefully regulate

229
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:33,699
themselves rather than having as as that

230
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,449

demanding it and we're not using

privacy these organizations have no

238
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:22,659
other choice but to see that that was my

follow-up question which is five billion

are we going in the direction I think

there's aren't you just there's so much

249

collecting in it you love they're the

something wrong with that it allowed us

the option to choose at that something

that something that we got a little

responses started developing using item

think there's so much data out there

that I think that is the greatest ever

275
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:47,270
and my depression because I think the

276
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,950
issue that have it's not a matter of

277
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,389
having these informations but having all

278
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,990
of our information knowing that that's

279
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,700

00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:11,700
it's not really affected since I think

don't want to they don't mind especially

284
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:18,600
when you can't you get off in different
