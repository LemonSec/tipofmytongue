programs in organizations of all sizes

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,519
I've been following arguments

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,310
presentations and writings throughout

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,590
all of my security career so I mean it

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,840
quite concerning to say that it is my

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,840
pleasure to introduce to you IRA Winkler

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,190
Thanks does this work can you hear okay

33
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,990
wow this is kind of weird where you're

34
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:31,690
all hearing me and I'm not hearing me

35
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:34,780
so interesting okay so Wow I have a I so

36
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:37,780
what happened was yet yesterday I I

37
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,850
spoke at RSA I gave a keynote I gave the

38
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,460
last keynote of the day and that was

39
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,619
really annoying but it's still a keynote

40
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,050
so I shouldn't complain but at the same

41
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,920
time I had transcribers yesterday

42
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,869
because they were doing closed

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,820
captioning in real-time now I have

44
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,160
somebody doing sign language

45
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,690
transcribing and I just did it's like I

46
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,550
don't know if it comes out the same in

47
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,710
sign language I know a few things but

48
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,320
not a lot and it's like like for the

49
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,539
trans the captioning people I said

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,910
something like they're not sure of the

51
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,830
reason that they're there but now they

52
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,470
don't know what they know but they do

53
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,440
know why they do not know what they know

54
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,850
so anyway and then I just was I kind of

55
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,680
did everything and then I asked the

56
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,970
audience of things transcribers got it

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
right because I thought that was kind of

58
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,880
funny

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,700
and see if they knew grammar but that's

60
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,430
a side joke now so anyway yesterday I

61
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,560
gave the presentation with Tracy Tracy

62
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,019
was my co-presenter for this and she's

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,989
also my co-author but I'm so much better

64
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:36,700
even she would say that anyway I have to

65
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,060
say that because my ego won't let me not

66
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,049
say that so here's the concept for you

67
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:47,230
can stop stupid I always have stories on

68
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,170
why I give a presentation so there was

69
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,060
one time I was speaking at it's kind of

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,518
an equivalent to Abby's sites like corn

71
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,010
con that's what the Iowa version of

72
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,860
b-sides is you know lots of corn there I

73
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:03,519
guess so anyway what they were doing was

74
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:06,510
I was on I was online before my talk on

75
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,400
the buffet line and there was a table

76
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,910
you know along the buffet line and they

77
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,610
had a bunch of stickers and sorry this

78
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm not intent does anybody mind if I

79
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,610
curse okay so they were giving out if

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,620
you mind just say it I can come up with

81
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,020
alternatives it's just not as colorful

82
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,209
but anyway so they were they were giving

83
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,960
out a bunch of stickers that said don't

84
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,960
click on

85
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,540
and so as I was walking along that the

86
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,850
admin there was like this at stereotypic

87
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,040
admin type guy and he looks over sees

88
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,320
this don't click on stickers on the

89
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,109
table he's like I need a whole bunch of

90
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,180
these and I'm like really he's like yeah

91
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,610
I've got some of the stupidest users out

92
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,070
there I'm like really you must give your

93
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,840
users a lot of to click on he's

94
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,670
like what do you mean I'm like well I

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,340
can't click on if they don't have

96
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,280
 to click on and then he's like and

97
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,930
I go and then if they're like that clear

98
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,120
clicking on it what do you do to stop it

99
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,800
after they click on it he's like what do

100
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,870
you mean I go well you're giving them

101
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,810
all the to click on and then

102
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,500
they're clicking on it I go kind of your

103
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,080
fault

104
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,149
he's like what do you mean I go and

105
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,370
anyway he just feed me what I meant he

106
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,049
just didn't want to invent it so when

107
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,760
you stop and think about it here's the

108
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,520
problem when we start talking about

109
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,890
users everybody thinks it's the users

110
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,419
and frankly you know I'm gonna get into

111
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,880
this I don't want to like cover too much

112
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,120
of my presentation now but we have a

113
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,400
problem in this industry where we

114
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,800
constantly blame the users in ways that

115
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,349
nobody would ever think of blaming in

116
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,360
other forms of business processes so

117
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,420
what we really need to do is start

118
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,700
looking at the user as a part of the

119
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,590
system and that's a big difference

120
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,510
compared to what people are currently

121
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,849
doing which is you're looking at this

122
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,070
user and people are out there I mean you

123
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,830
know right now awareness training is the

124
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,540
new snake-oil of cybersecurity because

125
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,460
they're like we want to create you know

126
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,770
we are going to create the human

127
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,229
firewall we're gonna create the last

128
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,359
line of defense and I'm like if your

129
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:15,080
users are the last line of defense

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,800
please quit now your users will fail

131
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,990
miserably I mean consider how many like

132
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,090
how many people think that firewalls are

133
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,120
the best thing to ever hit cybersecurity

134
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,669
and then stop and think you really want

135
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,530
a human firewall those are even worse

136
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,190
than the regular firewall so you got to

137
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:38,119
start to consider that issue let's see

138
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,400
Bing so first before we go on what is

139
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,729
stupid you know I actually looked it up

140
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,370
in the dictionary

141
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:47,400
stupid by definition is having or

142
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,400
showing a great lack of intelligence or

143
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,258
common sense now let's kind of try to

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,938
break that down a little bit you know

145
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,159
the definition of stupid is actually

146
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,249
pretty simple so even a stupid person

147
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:01,800
knows what stupid is so you know first

148
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:05,069
place do you hire people with a great

149
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,139
lack of intelligence you know do you go

150
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:09,960
out saying I need to hire a stupid

151
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,370
person you know and then you go in and

152
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,068
then think about it this way

153
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,680
if you hire somebody who demonstrates a

154
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:19,229
great lack of intelligence whose fault

155
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,419
is that you know I would say it's not

156
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,008
the users fault if they're that's stupid

157
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,469
you're the one putting them in a

158
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,110
position of responsibility if they're

159
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:31,319
this stupid why did you hire them I will

160
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,330
however say in sorry that's right I'm

161
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,969
not trying to disparage anybody who ever

162
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,460
worked at McDonald's but McDonald's has

163
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:40,889
a system in place where they can hire

164
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,589
one of the dumbest people on the planet

165
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,020
and they can still get consistently a

166
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:50,550
hamburger like I can get the same

167
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:53,430
hamburger in downtown Tampa that I can

168
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,199
get in hungry and literally I did go to

169
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,060
hungry and get a ham McDonald's

170
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,889
hamburger except they called it a

171
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,599
quarter not a quarter pounder but

172
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,479
something different like a Mick Royal

173
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:06,389
whatever they said in in Pulp Fiction

174
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:09,389
but anyway Wow Pulp Fiction reference

175
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,399
didn't do one of those before now let's

176
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,800
talk about do you hire people without

177
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,599
common sense you know that's the other

178
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,309
definition of stupid either they don't

179
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,180
have intelligence or they don't have

180
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:21,029
common sense

181
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,979
now in the first place you know my

182
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:26,009
backgrounds in psychology that's my

183
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,688
educational background and you know

184
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,879
there's a fundamental principle that

185
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,909
says you can't have common sense without

186
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,699
common knowledge so if your people don't

187
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:37,620
have common sense that implies you're

188
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,649
not giving them the common knowledge so

189
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,770
again that falls back on you are you

190
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,959
giving people the appropriate skills and

191
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,979
well you can't give them abilities but

192
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,990
are you giving them the appropriate

193
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,329
knowledge and skills that they need to

194
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,169
do their job right and if you're not

195
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:56,139
giving them that skills those

196
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:59,590
then that knowledge that again comes

197
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:02,889
back to your fault so anyway so now the

198
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,080
question is who's the stupid one and I

199
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:08,740
will refer to the great philosopher

200
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,599
Peggy Bundy and in one of the Peggy

201
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,469
Bundy of how many people don't know

202
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:16,180
Peggy Bundy I hate you but anyway Peggy

203
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:18,819
Bundy is a character out of the show

204
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,979
married with children and it's one of

205
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:22,719
those things where like you know how

206
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,849
many people know for those of you who

207
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:29,349
don't know Peggy Bundy how many people

208
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:31,960
know Modern Family okay so anyway in

209
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:34,569
Modern Family the guy the the old guy

210
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,360
who has Sofia vegara as the husband that

211
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,120
is Al Bundy Sofia Vergara is essentially

212
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,750
Peggy Bundy but a little bit lower class

213
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,209
trashy type so anyway so just imagine

214
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,839
Peggy Bundy once had one of the best

215
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:52,300
lines ever on TV and that philosophy was

216
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,519
if you give a monkey a gun and the

217
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,800
monkey shoots somebody do you blame the

218
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,890
monkey or the person who gave the monkey

219
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,589
the gun this is pretty much what we're

220
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,390
doing in cybersecurity we're out here

221
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:07,240
and I'm not even saying the users or

222
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,890
monkeys but we're basically acting like

223
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,320
we're giving the monkey a gun and it's

224
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,920
not their fun and it's not it's not your

225
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,890
fault

226
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,870
so anyway keep that in mind so here's

227
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,920
the other part of this does anybody here

228
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,320
do awareness for a living okay so I can

229
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,839
really go ahead off on this one then so

230
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,490
you know for the most part you know it's

231
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,010
not your fault either it's not your

232
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,959
fault as computer computer professionals

233
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,300
or IT professionals or whatever you want

234
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,160
to call yourselves because you've been

235
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,410
fed a bunch of crap over the years

236
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,540
you've been fed this whole thing like

237
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,149
you can create the Paragons of virtue

238
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,689
you can create the human firewall you

239
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:48,970
can create you know the last line of

240
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,949
defense the first line of defense and

241
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,690
all that you know it's like bro science

242
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:54,790
it's like you work out a lot you see all

243
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,399
those like you know like what is it the

244
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,529
lunkheads in the gym like protein bro

245
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,490
you know lots of protein you know it's

246
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,589
like we have this

247
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,610
same thing for awareness it's like funny

248
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,730
videos we need funny videos we need

249
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,950
gamification

250
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:13,149
nobody knows who says gamification that

251
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:15,310
gamification but they love it even

252
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:18,520
though they have no clue what it is so

253
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,589
anyway this is the problem you are being

254
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,600
fed a bunch of crap by the people in the

255
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,750
awareness industry because they want to

256
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,010
sell you stuff I would love somebody in

257
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,140
the awareness industry because I'm

258
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:33,550
technically in it let me tell you

259
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:35,920
something awareness 100% will fail at

260
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,469
some point in time I promise you that

261
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,959
and any security professional who sells

262
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,140
you or author you something who never

263
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,660
who says who that their stuff isn't

264
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,560
gonna fail they are a full or a liar or

265
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:53,469
both everything will fail at one point

266
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,910
in time so what just like awareness will

267
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,640
fail but everybody in the awareness

268
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,600
industry is you know we will conquer

269
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,100
human error

270
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,830
you're not conquering human error I

271
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,020
promise that anybody who believes that

272
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,270
human error is conquered they kind of

273
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,310
like really reinforce the fact because

274
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,199
they convinced you of something really

275
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,079
dumb so anyway I'll leave it there

276
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,300
so here's the thing again not really you

277
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,029
but the other part of this is

278
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,819
everybody's focusing on the proximity of

279
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:24,579
the error in other words they're sitting

280
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,190
there saying well the user clicks on a

281
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:29,620
phishing message the user is there for

282
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,420
what we need to fix the user is the

283
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,130
proximity of the error and I'm gonna

284
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,709
beat this to death a little bit later

285
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:38,680
but for example if there's an error like

286
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:40,599
if there's a medical issue where like

287
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,609
for example somebody performs surgery

288
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,130
they're like it's the fault of the

289
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,649
surgeon if there's a plane crash it's

290
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:50,200
the fault of the pilot if there's

291
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:52,750
something or other car crash it's the

292
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,310
fault of the driver the reality is when

293
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,399
we start looking into this you're gonna

294
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,569
see these people are well I shouldn't

295
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,060
say that you've got some really bad

296
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,490
doctors out there but you know these

297
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,140
people are just the proximity it doesn't

298
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,600
mean they're the cause of the error and

299
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,970
that's a very very big distinction that

300
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,620
people don't want to acknowledge so

301
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,350
generally what

302
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,240
we're doing is you know it's like if a

303
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,650
user makes a mistake everybody says we

304
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,690
need more awareness training we need

305
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,770
better awareness trained we need funnier

306
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,660
awareness training

307
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,960
that's like saying we need healthier

308
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,910
Canaries of Canaries died in a coal mine

309
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,190
that is not what really should happen

310
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,959
what you need to do is figure out if

311
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,570
there is an error why did the error

312
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,300
happen much like if a canary dies in a

313
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,550
coal mine the coal the canary died not

314
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,800
because the canary wasn't healthy the

315
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,229
canary died because the mine wasn't safe

316
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,109
if a user makes a mistake

317
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:51,190
that's because the system is essentially

318
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:53,440
not safe in one form or another so let's

319
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,320
take a look anybody know who anybody not

320
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,130
know who this is I hate you even more

321
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,460
anyway this is new man from the TV show

322
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,980
Seinfeld I have a Brazilian girlfriend I

323
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,010
explain all of American culture with

324
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,930
Seinfeld I don't intend it that way but

325
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,790
I just sit there and watch Seinfeld then

326
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,050
all of a sudden it's like wait let me

327
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,079
tell you I like trying to explain

328
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,390
something and all of a sudden I'm failed

329
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,510
reference but either way this is Newman

330
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:25,990
& Newman is the sorry I'm from New York

331
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,939
the putz the loser the idiot he and

332
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,190
somehow he ended up one day doing

333
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,540
accounting for these people now he has

334
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,820
nothing to do with what I'm going to

335
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,069
present but I needed a good slide for

336
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,320
accounting so what happens with

337
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:42,190
accounting how many of you travel for

338
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,920
work okay a few people how many of you

339
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,500
ever have to take out money or fill out

340
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,589
expense reports fill out time cards for

341
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,880
work you fill this out what happens if

342
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:54,550
you don't fill out your time card

343
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,070
properly does somebody say oh we can't

344
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,380
blame these people no we can't do that

345
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,120
you know we go ahead no you don't get

346
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,400
paid if you don't fill out your time

347
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,050
card properly you don't get reimbursed

348
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,100
if you don't fill out your travel

349
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:11,319
vouchers properly does anybody say we

350
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,750
awareness training to tell people what

351
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,790
to be afraid of how they should not fill

352
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,910
out therefore travel vouchers right they

353
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:21,280
basically say your job is to do your

354
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,469
travel voucher in the prescribed way if

355
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,160
you don't do it in the prescribed way it

356
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,769
will get

357
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,189
period that's the start of it that's the

358
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:33,040
last of it but then think of it also

359
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,860
this way how many people think that if

360
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,379
the CFO walked into a meeting and said

361
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,079
you know what we had a million dollar

362
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:43,329
loss yesterday and we had a million

363
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,370
dollar loss because you know it's people

364
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:47,829
we can't control those people you know

365
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,199
people do things we can't blame the

366
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:52,689
users because they're just users it

367
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:56,529
would be unfair know that CFO would be

368
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:58,569
fired immediately if there was any sort

369
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,720
of financial loss because he did not

370
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:04,689
anticipate a user doing something in the

371
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,569
non prescribed way because in accounting

372
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:10,180
as an example they set out processes

373
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:12,069
from start to finish they say what's

374
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,329
going to be recorded how it's going to

375
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:15,610
be recorded how it's going to be

376
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:19,388
categorized they tell people how to

377
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:21,970
input the data then they have a whole

378
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:24,220
bunch of audit features that after the

379
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,439
facts start auditing and seem did

380
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,819
everything happen a way it should have

381
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,949
happened and so on

382
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:32,410
and so that way is kind of like

383
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:35,560
interesting from start to finish there's

384
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,990
a process that anticipates error along

385
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,630
the way and mitigates the error along

386
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,880
the way and that's critical so now

387
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:45,310
another thing people don't know about me

388
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,100
is well I don't know some people might

389
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,229
but I'm a master scuba diver trainer

390
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,149
I love diving and then I want to dive

391
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,160
more frequently so I said how can it be

392
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,949
tax deductible so I said well if I'm a

393
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,259
dot master diver instructor I have to

394
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:02,019
keep diving to keep my skills refreshed

395
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:05,949
so anyway I and I I'm that was a nice

396
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:08,559
cool instructor so the first time I ever

397
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:12,370
heard the phrase you can't stop stupid

398
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,529
can't see int stop stupid was when I was

399
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,689
going through dive instructor training

400
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:19,300
and the instructor I guess he's

401
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:21,009
technically the instructor instructor he

402
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,979
was sitting there saying well you can't

403
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:25,899
stop stupid and I said there and started

404
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,170
thinking about I'm like this whole class

405
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:31,029
is about stopping stupid because when

406
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,180
you look at the whole dive for anybody

407
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:35,920
here dive you know certified divers okay

408
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,910
a few people you can confirm with the

409
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,589
others and

410
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,230
I don't hate you if you're not a diver

411
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,710
it's your loss in this case but anyway

412
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,450
so if you've ever done if you've ever

413
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,610
gone through scuba instruction the first

414
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,560
thing you do is you fill out a medical

415
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,510
form they make sure you're relatively

416
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,550
healthy then if you're relatively

417
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,350
healthy they put you in a pool and make

418
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,209
you swim like a hundred yards or

419
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,640
whatever it is to make sure you're not

420
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,260
gonna freak out in the water do they

421
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,629
really care how well you swim though

422
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,400
they reel that's just to make sure that

423
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,750
when you go in the water you're not

424
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,220
going to be acting like you're in a

425
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,829
panic mhm

426
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,089
people still do but at least they know

427
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,189
it's not going to be from the very

428
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,409
beginning then they sit you through a

429
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,330
whole bunch of classes most of these

430
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,940
classes are pretty much to try to tell

431
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,689
you how not to kill yourself because

432
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,760
think of it this way

433
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:27,640
in scuba diving there is an infinite

434
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,200
number of ways you can die frankly go

435
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,120
out on the street Drive a car there's an

436
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,100
infinite number of ways you can die but

437
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,560
either way in scuba diving you go

438
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,689
through you know you have to read dozens

439
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,639
of hours of training take tests and

440
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,040
everything and then they finally put you

441
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,140
in a pool they put you in a pool and

442
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,720
what is that maybe 10 feet of water

443
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,100
where you go through basic skills again

444
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,830
trying to make sure that you're

445
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,719
relatively comfortable have these skills

446
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,300
down before they put you in a more

447
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,610
dangerous situation then assuming you

448
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,500
pass this you go to an open water

449
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,750
you know facility the open water

450
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,940
facility is a really very open water

451
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,570
it's not allowed to be more than 30 feet

452
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,820
deep

453
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,590
usually it's probably around 15 to 20

454
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,320
feet deep and it's kind of hard to kill

455
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:14,320
yourself in 15 to 20 feet in water but

456
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,730
people can but they don't but then you

457
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,000
start and see and this is actually a

458
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,870
picture where they're testing people and

459
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,490
you know without going through the

460
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,409
details they're trying to like see if

461
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,320
people can just kind of get a neutral

462
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,600
buoyancy and these people around now

463
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,879
another part is before we take students

464
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,580
in the water at the facility in the

465
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,190
first place I have to make sure my

466
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,929
insurance is up-to-date the school I

467
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,150
would teach under it has to make sure

468
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,010
their insurance is up-to-date the died

469
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,110
facility we goes who has to make sure

470
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,790
their insurance is up-to-date and then

471
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,550
the students don't know it but we take

472
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,350
out an policy for the Stu

473
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,940
they don't know about so if they kill

474
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,709
themselves they're covered by that

475
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,970
policy we don't want them to know

476
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,640
because then they'll try to make up some

477
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,220
reason to sue but then what happens is

478
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,080
they get in there we're covered we also

479
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,880
go ahead we know where the hyperbaric

480
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,159
chambers are just in case something goes

481
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,290
wrong we have medical equipment we have

482
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,480
oxygen equipment and this is all before

483
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,010
we get in the water then we inspect

484
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,600
their equipment we have the students

485
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,240
inspect their equipment we don't trust

486
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,399
these students because they just not

487
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,350
learning about it but we still go

488
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,300
through and do all that then we put them

489
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,639
in the water and then you can barely see

490
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,399
this but in the far sorry I'm bad at

491
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,010
this far upper right hand corner you see

492
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,080
one guy hovering there and that's an

493
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:35,050
insistent instructor or a dive master

494
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,179
that a good instructor would bring along

495
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,649
with them because it's hard to keep

496
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,360
track while you're trying to make sure

497
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,850
each individual student is doing

498
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,830
something that other students don't go

499
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,219
off and do something stupid

500
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,540
I was once certifying people and I was

501
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,950
down there and all of a sudden I no

502
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,930
corner of my eye I was working with

503
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,240
somebody like right there and I see this

504
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,640
one guy start looking over the edge of

505
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,060
the platform and start to crawl

506
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,670
underneath and I'm like I'm thinking

507
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,980
what is this idiot doing you know I told

508
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:08,020
him don't go off this platform before

509
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,910
but then luckily the assistant

510
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,160
instructor pulled him up and put him

511
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,010
back on the platform and said stay here

512
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,530
or whatever it was but then all that is

513
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:20,500
in place and it statistically makes

514
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,240
scuba diving safer than bowling because

515
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,890
people have heart attacks when they Bowl

516
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,930
because they're in that good physical

517
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:30,850
condition they need better medicals so

518
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:33,220
another corresponding things you know a

519
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,530
lot of scuba instruction much like

520
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,960
accounting it's kind of along the lines

521
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:40,629
of safety science and for those of you

522
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,790
who want more information there's forgot

523
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,040
his last name but this guy Deckard dek

524
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:48,550
keer is really good on safety science

525
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,590
type of stuff and what they look at is

526
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,110
that a user in the current safety

527
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,899
science is that a user is just part of

528
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,590
the system if the user fails that is a

529
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,200
fail

530
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:02,320
in the entire system if somebody is

531
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,289
injured at work that person is injured

532
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,059
at work because the whole system has led

533
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:09,429
to the point where that person has

534
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:11,830
injured themselves and that's a very

535
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:13,600
very critical distinction you know so

536
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,360
for example I was once

537
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,279
um I was doing a secure I was creating

538
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,990
an awareness program for this company

539
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,240
that does lighting a manufacturer

540
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,100
lighting and we were talking to the

541
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,770
safety guy because we like when we

542
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,020
implement to quit awareness programs we

543
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,240
like to learn from other programs that

544
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,610
awareness is part of it as well

545
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,500
so we spoke to the safety guy and the

546
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,779
safety guy said yeah you know on our

547
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,700
factory floors

548
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,649
you know we drew these yellow lines down

549
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,200
the like kind of like a third of the way

550
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:46,178
over down the aisles and he's like

551
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,490
because what we found was we had a lot

552
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,470
of accidents where forklifts were

553
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,049
driving into people or people were

554
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,730
walking into forklifts so we you know we

555
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,070
came up with all these studies and

556
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,740
finally I invested in 50 gallons of

557
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,590
paint and I painted a line down the

558
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,929
aisles and people were to stay to the

559
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,799
right and forklifts were to stay to the

560
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:10,600
left and all our accidents went away

561
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,760
except for maybe about ten percent of

562
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,149
them and then that was because people

563
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,760
were on their iPhones and wandering over

564
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:20,439
into there or the drivers were just

565
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,840
looking in the wrong places and still

566
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,000
hit people but this is critical and a

567
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,439
big thing about safety science safety

568
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,179
science people generally have millions

569
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,610
and millions of dollars at their

570
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:35,320
disposal because if somebody injures

571
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,449
themselves in a company they're a hard

572
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,520
financial cost for this in the

573
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,590
cybersecurity world we don't track that

574
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,799
as well but if somebody injures themself

575
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,820
on the job there's insurance there's

576
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:48,460
investigations there's potentially

577
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,379
workers comp they might sue you or

578
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,899
something like that so there's a lot of

579
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,510
hard data science and they review

580
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:58,510
everything but again the proximity of

581
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:01,600
where the accident or injury occurs is

582
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,640
just the symptom the users are the

583
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,860
symptoms they're not the cause they're

584
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,140
just what the symptoms are of the

585
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,789
problem so now these are a bunch of

586
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,129
Boeing 737 max

587
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:14,559
Jetts and I'm assuming a lot of you have

588
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:16,269
heard about that even though your for

589
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:21,820
some reason don't know who Peggy Bundy

590
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:24,070
is so these 737 max Jets obviously there

591
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,168
were two deadly accidents with them at a

592
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,629
bunch of other at you know incidents

593
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:30,279
where they didn't crash and now

594
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:31,988
everybody was saying was this pilot

595
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:33,669
error when these first happened

596
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:35,889
everybody was like this is pilot error

597
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:37,960
the pilots steered the planes into the

598
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:40,238
ground and then once they started

599
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,489
looking at it well actually start

600
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:45,609
thinking about it you know could the

601
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:47,440
pilots have saved the planes yes they

602
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:50,109
could have however

603
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,450
wait you know was it possible yeah it

604
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:54,699
was remotely possible they could have

605
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,979
saved the planes but what really

606
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,950
happened was yes the pilots were at the

607
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:03,220
control and if they knew how to shut

608
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:06,220
down the auto pilots maybe they could

609
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,529
save it but the problem was the pilots

610
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,720
for first off they pretty much were told

611
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:13,509
you don't really need much training on

612
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,960
these new planes because these are 737

613
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:18,999
max jets they're kind of the same as the

614
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,970
737-800 737-900

615
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:24,220
that you all had previously flown so you

616
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,889
don't really need much you know but they

617
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,929
didn't tell them well by the way we've

618
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:30,668
kind of changed a few things the whole

619
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:32,259
balance of the plane is different

620
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,609
because the engines are a little bit

621
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:35,440
different than the whole weight of the

622
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:37,239
planes are different so they fly a

623
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,460
little different but it's II don't worry

624
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:41,609
about that and then another thing they

625
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,619
did was there's these things called a

626
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:46,539
OAS angle-of-attack sensors on the front

627
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:49,389
of the airplanes and there's two one on

628
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:53,559
each side and in the old well the old

629
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:56,228
the other 737 planes if one was off and

630
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,879
the other one if one was off like one

631
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:59,830
said we're going down the other said

632
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:01,809
you're going up there was a warning that

633
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,539
said there's a discrepancy between the

634
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:07,809
two they took that away that was an

635
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:09,908
optional safety feature that Airlines

636
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:11,859
had to pay extra for and they you know

637
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:14,049
some of them chose not to pay extra for

638
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:15,879
that there's also a whole bunch of

639
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:18,668
different functions where before if

640
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:20,590
there was a discrepancy not only would

641
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:20,860
it say there's a discrepancy but a kind

642
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,439
of

643
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,350
the pilots decide in this case however

644
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,150
they basically said you know what if one

645
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,610
says you're going down we're just going

646
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:33,160
to assume the planes going down or sorry

647
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,919
no the planes going up so we're gonna

648
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,929
steer the plane down so when they pilots

649
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,910
were able to save the plane in one case

650
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:41,740
they went ahead they're like wow we got

651
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,750
it back under control they put the

652
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,670
autopilot back on autopilot says hey

653
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,710
we're gonna stare you right back into

654
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,799
the ground and that's why one of the

655
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:53,440
accidents happen but these were systemic

656
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,750
problems that occurred not just by the

657
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,299
proximity but they happened when they

658
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:00,669
started writing software years before

659
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:04,450
these accidents so there was a whole

660
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:06,610
systematic failure along the way so now

661
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,309
going back into safety science when

662
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:12,040
people actually look at where incidents

663
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:14,290
happen why do these incidents happen

664
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,809
who's really at fault when they've gone

665
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,389
through this they found that 90% of all

666
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,428
injuries or incidents were however you

667
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,679
want to call them are the result of the

668
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:26,020
environment only 10 percent of the

669
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,480
result of a user doing something you

670
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:31,000
might want to consider stupid in theory

671
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,400
but these 10 percent like what are they

672
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,980
so for example in factories you know

673
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,530
people might drop a like a heavy wrench

674
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,260
and break their foot as one example they

675
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,940
might drive a forklift into somebody you

676
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,620
know and why are they doing this it's

677
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,660
like well you know without a line down

678
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,090
the center it sounds stupid but there's

679
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,340
chaos for lack of a better term you know

680
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,928
it's kind of like one of those it's like

681
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,639
an airport you know how like they have

682
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:56,470
those guys come out with lights and tell

683
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,169
the trucks to stop to let the plane go

684
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,000
by it's a lot like that you know in

685
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:02,559
factory floors without you know not

686
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,799
having the people with those like little

687
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,629
lights that say stop so these people

688
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,970
look at it and say hey wait a second

689
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,549
these people are being injured not

690
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,110
because of their own actions but 90% of

691
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,549
the time if we manipulate the

692
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,530
environments we'll get rid of these

693
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:21,490
injuries and that's critical the other

694
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:23,918
10% are the users fault so what are what

695
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,770
is that ten percent and that 10%

696
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,260
includes you know things like what you

697
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:31,210
might call stupid carelessness some

698
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,730
might be blatant ignorance where the

699
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,110
users just don't know some might be a

700
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,909
lack

701
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,610
training and again that lack of training

702
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:41,549
might be on you you know we all see like

703
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:43,949
you know around we all see like how many

704
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:46,379
people watch like failarmy on the

705
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,850
internet or like the Darwin Awards and

706
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,950
stuff like that there are always

707
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,139
somebody like you see trying to clear a

708
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,210
stuck snow blower like where you're like

709
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,309
I'm in Florida why am I giving this

710
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,840
example but you know there are these

711
00:27:56,309 --> 00:28:00,090
things called snow blowers where you

712
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,789
push it away and it blows the snow to

713
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:05,549
the side and it has these cranks that

714
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:08,309
you know eat up the snow and what

715
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:10,260
happens is like every so often it gets

716
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:12,690
stuck and then you see this thing

717
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,940
cranking away and it gets stuck and then

718
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,880
you see somebody trying to push the snow

719
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,460
into it that's stupid I give you that

720
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,500
that you can call that person stupid but

721
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,779
you know you have issues like that

722
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,570
but a lot of people also forget the

723
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:30,120
possibility of malice sometimes when you

724
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,939
have this somebody might actually want

725
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,889
to cause damage to the organization they

726
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,470
might just be a psychopath or a

727
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:39,178
sociopath they just want it they don't

728
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,730
care they might just think it's

729
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,470
interesting you know like in the Batman

730
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,690
movie some people just want to watch

731
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,750
things burn and that's why they do these

732
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,059
things so anyway that's the 10% of the

733
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,909
problem now here's the other part cuz

734
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:56,269
everybody says we need better awareness

735
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:59,549
awareness is only 20% of that 10%

736
00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:05,070
applied behavioral science in essence is

737
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:07,139
that antecedent creates a behavior or I

738
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,260
shouldn't say creates influences a

739
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:12,469
behavior that's a very big distinction

740
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,370
because you give somebody information

741
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,679
maybe maybe not

742
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,959
they'll follow that information you know

743
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,480
but again it's called it's called an

744
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,159
antecedent because information like it's

745
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,460
good you know you know what I called IBC

746
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,679
because IBC sounds like a disease so ABC

747
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,350
sounds much cooler so anyway it's an

748
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,159
antecedent influences of behavior then a

749
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:37,860
behavior does actually create a

750
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,470
consequence consequences drive 80

751
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:44,549
percent or more of user behaviors in the

752
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:45,620
future so for example I'm sitting at a

753
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,860
restaurant

754
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:52,370
and you know a waitress comes over and

755
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:54,169
says oh this plate is hot I'm gonna be

756
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,300
sitting there like I'm a man

757
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,760
give me that plate and I'm gonna grab

758
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,129
that plate I'm gonna singe my fingers

759
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,010
trying to act like I'm not in serious

760
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,710
pain I'm gonna put the plate down pry my

761
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:09,110
fingers away from my skin at that point

762
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,660
and then the next time the wait waitress

763
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,520
comes over with a plate of ice cream I'm

764
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,520
gonna be like oh please put that down

765
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,190
why I suffered a consequence that was

766
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,929
undesirable the other part in

767
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,390
cybersecurity that's critical though

768
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:27,770
that we have to understand is sometimes

769
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:30,200
the consequences for bad things are good

770
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,840
for the user so for example a very

771
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,960
common one in our field is we tell users

772
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,850
not to reuse your business password with

773
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,410
your person as your personal password

774
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:44,209
what is the consequence for that

775
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:46,790
absolutely nothing actually it's a

776
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,620
positive consequence and the reason it's

777
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,320
a positive consequences the user doesn't

778
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:53,870
have to remember another password you

779
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,790
don't know it's a reused password you

780
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,709
can actually figure that out if you have

781
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,990
like you know threat intelligence tools

782
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,790
that search the dark web dark web and

783
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,860
look for compromised passwords and

784
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:06,200
sometimes you can test those passwords

785
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:10,610
but that takes a little bit of work but

786
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:13,040
usually bed user actions have a positive

787
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:15,740
consequence for them so it's reinforced

788
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,350
but anyway even awareness and the ideal

789
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,780
circumstance is only going to influence

790
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,129
20% of the 10% of behaviors and the

791
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,520
awareness profession doesn't want to

792
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:28,309
tell you that so what type of action

793
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,260
actually you know what what we're trying

794
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:32,720
to do is create a strategy for dealing

795
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:35,570
with user and I'll call this user

796
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,690
initiated loss because just because a

797
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,879
user takes an action it doesn't mean it

798
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,220
has to create damage it doesn't mean it

799
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,059
has to create a loss and this is a key

800
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:50,000
distinction the user is only initiating

801
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:52,639
a sequence of actions it does not mean

802
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,520
the users creating a loss you are

803
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,210
allowing the the loss to be created

804
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,830
because you have to

805
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,440
paid that a user is going to do

806
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:04,020
something negative and you're allowing

807
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,130
that user to create the Anette damage

808
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,950
and this is going to be a critical

809
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:10,140
distinction as we move forward now boom

810
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,419
and I'm gonna just move on but you can

811
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,830
see what you know pretty Pig well ugly

812
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:16,950
kind of picture I couldn't find a good

813
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:19,500
one anyway so what is boom lumba is a

814
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:22,380
counterterrorism strategy boom is

815
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,470
essentially where terrorists you know an

816
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,210
explosion is a boom and what happens is

817
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,690
left a boom is what can you

818
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:34,169
theoretically do proactively to stop an

819
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:37,409
attack from happening that's number one

820
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:41,730
that's left a boom right a boom is what

821
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:44,240
can you do after the attack to mitigate

822
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:48,299
the potential damage and begin recovery

823
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,289
so using the like using boom as a

824
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:54,270
strategy let me give like for example

825
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,830
there's there's no happy examples I'll

826
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,779
be upfront with you about this but

827
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,449
anyway let's use like September 11th

828
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:02,880
attacks as one of the examples so and

829
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,740
let's use the Pentagon I'll use the

830
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,899
Pentagon specifically and you'll see why

831
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,970
in a second but you know you look at

832
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:11,250
this and you say well gee why were you

833
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,510
know we were we tracking terrorists it's

834
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,340
like you know we were kind of tracking

835
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,529
terrorists and the job of the government

836
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,840
is to theoretically figure out who the

837
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:20,850
terrorists are what are their operations

838
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,459
figure out how to stop the terrorists

839
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:26,250
from either existing or forwarding their

840
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,929
acts then simultaneously you also want

841
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,250
to go ahead and strengthen your

842
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:32,460
protection and the reason I use the

843
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,590
Pentagon as an example is a lot of

844
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,840
people don't realize this but a couple

845
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,330
years before the September 11th attack

846
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,270
they actually did strengthen the

847
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,549
Pentagon for potential not necessarily

848
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,830
an airplane but they strengthened like

849
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:49,049
fire protection they put some extra

850
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:51,120
steel in there that stopped a whole

851
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:54,240
bunch of damage so even though a plane

852
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,158
flew in there was significant damage it

853
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,990
was not as bad as it would have been if

854
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,450
it happened a couple years earlier

855
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:03,059
because they hardened those buildings

856
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:05,279
proactively again not knowing what it

857
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,070
was and that's a critical factor you

858
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,679
don't have to

859
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:11,168
what the attacks are to harden the

860
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:14,490
surface but anyway then boom happened

861
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:17,799
and now moving on to another unpleasant

862
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:20,080
example you know so when when there's a

863
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,270
bombing yes you want to figure out can

864
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,668
we stop these people imminently right

865
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,770
before the bombing that's kind of what

866
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:29,500
you want to do during boom but let's

867
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:31,540
start moving after boom laughter boom

868
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,639
first thing you have to do is be afraid

869
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,040
of something like a secondary attack as

870
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,500
an example so in the Boston Marathon

871
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,600
bombing they had the first bombing and

872
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,460
then there was a delay like you know a

873
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,159
couple minutes delay I can't remember

874
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,870
the exact amount but before the second

875
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,819
bombing so what happened was first

876
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,339
people ran away then all the first

877
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,990
responders came in and they were the

878
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,360
potential victims of the secondary

879
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:56,979
explosion that happened likewise you

880
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,690
have to have your you know you have to

881
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,600
prepare what about if there's like

882
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:04,210
chemical poisonous gas and this might or

883
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,790
might not be intentional so for example

884
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:09,070
if a bomb accidentally like hits a

885
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,350
propane leak or something like that you

886
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:13,090
have to be prepared for that likewise

887
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,319
you have to make sure proactively and

888
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,780
this actually came up during a

889
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,520
congressional hearing this week sorry is

890
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,700
it this week or last week well we're

891
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,440
Saturday anyway the week before today

892
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,720
what happened was during a congressional

893
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,270
hearing one of the senators asked the

894
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,129
head of or one of the DHS people do we

895
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:33,160
have enough respirators for people who

896
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,070
might get there what is it called a Cara

897
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,960
Nova

898
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,880
yeah cope in nineteen that's easier Oh

899
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,790
put your sign down anyway

900
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,760
but cope in nineteen you know but you

901
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:48,009
know do we have that so anyway that's

902
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,330
another factor are we prepared and

903
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,130
that's a whole science and it's

904
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:53,590
different disciplines along the way and

905
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:56,110
each phase is essentially its own

906
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,210
security process you know each phase

907
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:01,090
involves protection detection and

908
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,010
reaction you know and the canary the

909
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:07,510
canary like canary diamond and coal mine

910
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:09,850
is only involved at the point of boom 97

911
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,680
now let's take a step back if you read

912
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:13,960
the Verizon data breach report the

913
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,419
Verizon data breach report and pretty

914
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,030
much every other report says 90 percent

915
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,400
of all significant losses result from

916
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,700
some

917
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,329
form the user initiated a chain of

918
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,669
events

919
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:27,980
I'm phrasing this user initiated chain

920
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,349
of events of this case so each phase

921
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,260
that you're gonna do has protect detect

922
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:35,119
and react and as I mentioned before I

923
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,760
put a slide here specifically on that

924
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,579
I'm dealing with a concept and I want

925
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,740
you to think user initiated loss I don't

926
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:44,480
want you to think stupid user much like

927
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,669
that guy who had was wanted to give out

928
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,450
stickers that said you know don't click

929
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:53,000
on you have to first realize that

930
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,399
you are giving people to click on

931
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,680
that's number one but if they just cause

932
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,170
they click on it doesn't mean it

933
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,118
ruins your network if somebody clicking

934
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,480
on ruins your network your network

935
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:09,230
sucks you gotta understand that so

936
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:11,720
anyway the user just initiates possible

937
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,819
loss you have to actually give the user

938
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,848
the ability to create the loss you have

939
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:19,339
to facilitate the loss and so on so

940
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,710
let's step through the whole process of

941
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:24,380
left boom boom and right a boom from a

942
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:26,299
cyber security perspective so in the

943
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,190
first place what are you gonna do to

944
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:30,920
prevent the user from being put in the

945
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,900
position of initiating the loss that's

946
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,329
number one what are you gonna do to stop

947
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,210
your user from appeared from appearing

948
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:39,559
to be stupid you know ideally maybe you

949
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,869
want to take away the decision

950
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,970
capability you know you have a user who

951
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:45,950
has some capability like too much file

952
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,569
privileges or something maybe you

953
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,399
shouldn't give them that privilege

954
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:51,770
maybe you shouldn't like go ahead and

955
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,900
define like you can do this or that or

956
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,779
something else you want to create a

957
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:59,920
culture of consequences to assist things

958
00:37:56,779 --> 00:38:04,450
so you know I mentioned for example that

959
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,849
was a good one so I worked at NSA

960
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:10,399
working at NSA we always had to wear our

961
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:12,260
badge and if you like you didn't wear

962
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,390
your badge you got a bunch of hell for

963
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,160
that not from your bosses or anything

964
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,558
but from your co-workers so there's one

965
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,848
time I was working shift work really

966
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,339
hated the job but I was working

967
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:24,109
overnight and we were tracking certain

968
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:26,359
types of military units I can't tell you

969
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:28,880
what or how but every time we saw one of

970
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:31,009
these units I'd have to like get a map

971
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,529
out and plot and the plotter would put

972
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:35,569
where the unit was on the map and there

973
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:37,160
had a moving arm and what I had to do

974
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:39,288
was I had to take off my bed so it

975
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,868
didn't get wrapped up so anyway one day

976
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:44,420
I put the map out put over poor and then

977
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:46,099
I ran to the restroom and then as I was

978
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,289
coming back there's a guard the guards

979
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:50,990
like where's your badge and I'm like

980
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:52,819
what right I go I must be at my desk

981
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,558
he's like we're going to your desk I go

982
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:56,869
you're not allowed anywhere near my desk

983
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,970
because I I'll wait by the door so

984
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:00,980
anyway I go in the room and I'm looking

985
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,169
around there and I'm like looking under

986
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,700
the desk I can't find it and then all of

987
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,349
a sudden my co-workers sitting there's

988
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,750
like are you looking for something I'm

989
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:10,700
like where's my damn badge actually I

990
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,079
said I already got permission to

991
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,419
curse I'm like where's my badge

992
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,279
and the guys like what badge the one

993
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,170
that should be around your neck I'm like

994
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:19,549
give me my badge and I started

995
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,799
then the guards like is there a problem

996
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:23,538
here and then all of a sudden then I

997
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:26,538
finally got my badge and then do you

998
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:28,789
think I ever forgot that badge again no

999
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:30,529
I mean there was another case where I

1000
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:32,539
went to a government contractor I left

1001
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:34,460
my burn bag out I didn't even know I

1002
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:37,069
didn't even know like one morning I get

1003
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,960
to work I get a call IRA can you come to

1004
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:39,769
my office it was the security manager

1005
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,630
the security major

1006
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:44,089
are you missing anything I go not that I

1007
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,609
know of he's like how about this does

1008
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:48,558
this look familiar I'm like I don't have

1009
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:50,930
a personal relationship with it it was

1010
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:54,019
my burn bag though he's like well we got

1011
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,788
this from your desk so I go ok never

1012
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:58,220
forgot my burn bag again but there was a

1013
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,960
culture of sending guards around to make

1014
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,538
sure these things didn't happen so

1015
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,309
anyway number one left the boom

1016
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:06,259
governance and here's the key factor do

1017
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:08,779
you define how a process should be

1018
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:10,220
committed from start to finish can you

1019
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:12,109
take your users out of the

1020
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,019
decision-making process so that they're

1021
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:17,180
not even in the position to create the

1022
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:18,529
loss and so on he's giving me dirty

1023
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,859
looks because I'm running out of time

1024
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:23,329
blame him anyway so boom this is where

1025
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:26,450
the user is presented with the

1026
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:29,240
opportunity to initiate loss or not

1027
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:32,058
initiate loss do they detect the loss do

1028
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,609
they stop the loss do they go ahead and

1029
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:35,550
do

1030
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:37,410
bad action I would put that down anyway

1031
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,210
and do they go ahead and sound the

1032
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,940
alarms but again this could be

1033
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:44,310
accidental or it could be malicious and

1034
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,800
you have to you don't let me tell you

1035
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,360
one thing you don't care if the user is

1036
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,430
doing something bad because they're

1037
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,470
malicious or because they're just

1038
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:55,560
well-meaning or because they made a

1039
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,750
mistake you just care that the user is

1040
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,610
potentially initiating the loss much

1041
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,650
like accountants they don't know

1042
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,320
initially why they're investigating they

1043
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,820
just detect that a losses in there now

1044
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,320
here's the thing about policies and

1045
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,300
governance and where I have a problem

1046
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,610
with most awareness training most

1047
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,720
awareness training and how many people

1048
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:18,180
don't know Elmer Fudd okay good we fella

1049
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,040
know she raised for him anyway sorry

1050
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,720
you'll have to ask a friend on this one

1051
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,050
blame him because he's not giving me

1052
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,879
time but anyway so most awareness

1053
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,830
programs they're teaching people how to

1054
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,110
be on the lookout for the Westerly

1055
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:33,270
wabbit they're trying to tell people

1056
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:34,830
what to be afraid of they're saying be

1057
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,590
afraid of the hacker they're going to

1058
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:40,020
send you phishing messages as opposed to

1059
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:43,050
telling you here's how you do your job

1060
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,140
right and how you do your job right how

1061
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:48,720
its defined should go ahead and

1062
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:50,609
proactively address potential ways bad

1063
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,830
people might try to manipulate you and

1064
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:55,410
this sounds like a very fine line but

1065
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,210
this is a very critical line because you

1066
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:59,430
want to define to people how to do their

1067
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,230
jobs right much like how you fill out

1068
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,569
your timecard they don't tell you Oh

1069
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,790
make sure you don't do this or don't do

1070
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,800
that they tell you here's how you fill

1071
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,630
out your timecard right and if you don't

1072
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,430
get it right you're not getting paid and

1073
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:15,450
then you learn how to do it right pretty

1074
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:17,149
quickly then right a boom a loss has

1075
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,250
been initiated does the environment

1076
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,830
anticipate it in one way or another at

1077
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:25,740
some macro level or a fine micro level

1078
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:27,960
for that specific attack the right of

1079
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,959
boom your environment has to expect that

1080
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,780
users are going to initiate a loss how

1081
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,390
are you going to proactively plan for

1082
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,850
the initiation of a loss and maybe let

1083
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:41,310
some of it go maybe you let all of it go

1084
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:43,470
and you suffer a loss but at least go

1085
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,759
ahead and understand how the loss

1086
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:46,589
occurred because

1087
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,050
it's not cost-effective to stop

1088
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,850
everything and that's a critical factor

1089
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:53,820
how many people are security people in

1090
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:56,100
this room okay you're all failures by

1091
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,110
definition you are failures I looked up

1092
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,839
the definitions I read the dictionary

1093
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:03,450
but the definition of security is being

1094
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:06,570
free from risk you will never be free

1095
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,939
from risk your job is how to optimize

1096
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:11,130
your risk how to balance potential

1097
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,200
spending on secure so while risk

1098
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,630
management how to balance the potential

1099
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,970
spending on preventing potential loss

1100
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,770
with allowing the potential loss to go

1101
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,990
on because you do not have the resources

1102
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,120
and budget to do everything so keep that

1103
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:27,240
in mind most important you proactively

1104
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,790
go back figure out why the loss occurred

1105
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,250
figure out how it could be prevented in

1106
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,779
the future figure out how you got lucky

1107
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,750
because frequently it could have been

1108
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:39,420
much worse figure out why you got really

1109
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,400
unlucky sometimes and go ahead and

1110
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,030
proactively look at that so it doesn't

1111
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,400
happen again

1112
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,800
now that all sounds difficult but they

1113
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,380
do that in safety science they do that

1114
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,300
in accounting they do that in medical

1115
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,250
fields and the human body's kind of

1116
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,140
complicated keep that in mind they do

1117
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,210
this in operations if there's a major

1118
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:00,180
factory outage they go back and figure

1119
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,920
out how did this outage happen how can

1120
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,000
we prevent it in the future and so on

1121
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,770
now consider this if you can prevent 90%

1122
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,780
of the incidents again the incidents

1123
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,090
involving where a user initiates the

1124
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,950
loss you're gonna go ahead and mitigate

1125
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:16,350
a lot of other problems a lot of the

1126
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:18,419
other 10% and let me walk through this

1127
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:21,060
quickly and yeah I'm almost done don't

1128
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,820
put up any more signs honestly but so

1129
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:26,700
the CEO look at w-2 fraud right now we

1130
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,460
are gonna have rampant w2 fraud around

1131
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,680
the country w-2 fraud for those if you

1132
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,440
don't know elmer fudd i shouldn't expect

1133
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,629
you to know w-2s those are the tax forms

1134
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,270
you get at the year companies have to

1135
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:41,430
send out tax forms and they usually

1136
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,320
sends it to an accounting firm for the

1137
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,899
accounting firm to review it and send it

1138
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,480
out so what happens is it's very common

1139
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,180
for criminals to try to send a phishing

1140
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,550
message in and say I'm the CEO to a low

1141
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,279
level of HR person and say I'm the CEO

1142
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,660
we have a new accounting firm we need

1143
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,300
you to forward all the w2 information

1144
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,370
to this accounting firm and clearly it's

1145
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,680
a criminal act but you know it's a

1146
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:08,200
criminal firm but they want to go ahead

1147
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,529
and steal tax refunds but anyway it goes

1148
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,540
out and everybody's like ok wow we got

1149
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,590
tricked here's what should happen in the

1150
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,390
first place you should have

1151
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:18,550
anti-phishing you should have an

1152
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:20,379
anti-malware in place to go ahead filter

1153
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:23,140
out most of them if not all of these

1154
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:25,750
emails ideally you tagged external

1155
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,490
emails to insure that it's an you know

1156
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,130
that's like the CEOs coming from the

1157
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:32,770
external why is that and give the users

1158
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:35,140
all these hints then simultaneously once

1159
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:37,509
it gets to yeah I know and once it gets

1160
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:40,240
to the user all of a sudden you have

1161
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,220
done your job anyway once it gets to the

1162
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,109
user we're sitting there and the user

1163
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,569
shouldn't be thinking is this Alaska lis

1164
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:49,210
wabbit the user should be thinking this

1165
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,310
is a request for PII request for PII

1166
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,500
have to go through the head of HR as

1167
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,930
well as get approval from the general

1168
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:58,510
counsel it's not my job to figure out

1169
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:00,580
this is the Westly rabbit or not I am

1170
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:02,680
gonna go ahead and send this to the head

1171
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,290
of HR say here's a request I receive

1172
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,750
then let's say for some reason the user

1173
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:10,690
doesn't follow that instruction or let's

1174
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:12,370
say the head of HR falls for this then

1175
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,740
what you do is you go ahead and have

1176
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:17,049
data leak prevention software you know

1177
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,580
along the way and data leak prevention

1178
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:21,730
software will prevent this from going

1179
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:23,380
out proactively likewise you can say hey

1180
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,700
you're attaching a sensitive file do you

1181
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,890
really want to do that and potentially

1182
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,799
get fired that would help the situation

1183
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:31,990
along but now that's how it should be

1184
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,240
done properly consider the overlap

1185
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:37,000
though this is handling a PII

1186
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,729
the fact it's w-2 think about it this

1187
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,070
way this can handle PII or sorry this

1188
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:45,400
can handle w-2 fraud the same way it can

1189
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:47,260
handle like HIPAA fraud the same way can

1190
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,080
handle any other types of fraud that's

1191
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,060
related to PII data leak prevention

1192
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,460
stops a lot of other attacks and so on

1193
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:57,250
filters on incoming messages stop other

1194
00:46:54,460 --> 00:47:00,100
phishing messages and so on this I beat

1195
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:02,530
to death I'm not going to do that that I

1196
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,480
beat to death to here's a critical point

1197
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,400
though awareness is still mandatory I

1198
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,410
know I beat up on awareness but

1199
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,150
awareness should be there to tell people

1200
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:12,578
how to do things right

1201
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:15,099
where 'no sysm perfect i give you that

1202
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:18,520
but the issue is it's still a critical

1203
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:21,460
part of a good security program if

1204
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,170
implemented properly that's the most

1205
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,510
important part it should be implemented

1206
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:29,589
how it should be implemented now here's

1207
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:31,869
a critical concept are you basically

1208
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:34,328
addressing your user problem with a

1209
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:36,760
tactic or do are you implementing with a

1210
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:39,400
strategy the problem is people are

1211
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,650
addressing user error with the tactic of

1212
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,380
awareness it's kind of like saying for

1213
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:47,859
example I wanna have a war to fight

1214
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,240
I want my tanks to go in and like go in

1215
00:47:47,859 --> 00:47:52,690
and do everything

1216
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:55,149
tanks are a tactic you can't go ahead

1217
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:57,039
and ten win a war with just tanks you

1218
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:59,319
need the air support you need the cyber

1219
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,029
support these days you go ahead you need

1220
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:03,069
infantry because you can't just blow up

1221
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:05,529
a village you need to occupy the village

1222
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:08,200
and so on likewise for handling user

1223
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:10,240
error you need a strategy from start to

1224
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,250
finish that includes you know left a

1225
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,618
boom boom and right a boom and includes

1226
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:17,319
awareness and everything else but the

1227
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:19,720
message you should take again you're not

1228
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:21,670
trying to put healthier Canaries out

1229
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:25,000
there you're trying to make sure the

1230
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:26,049
mines are safe that is the most critical

1231
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,510
thing you can get out of this

1232
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:31,180
presentation I'm gonna skip this apply

1233
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:34,359
because it's just specific taro say but

1234
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:36,970
either way by my book it's awesome and

1235
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:39,220
then actually this is a new thing so I

1236
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:42,359
need your I need a vote here very

1237
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:44,950
