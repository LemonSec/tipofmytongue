8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,310

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,589
the people that do all the yelling and

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,819
delegating so we have it easy but it's

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,059
those folks that actually do other work

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,379

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,770
hearing the input from outside voices so

35
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,139
we definitely appreciate the fact that

36
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,729
you can come here expand upon your

37
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,470

38
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:44,110
make you become a better IT community in

39
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,759
Central Florida so thank you very big

year we had 1100 rescue attendees which

47
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,119
is one of our largest ones we will

48
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,609
probably have to expand a little bit

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,470
more next year to make sure we have more

50
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,170
activity in there for everyone but we

51
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,489
like to thank all of our attendants who

52
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,048

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,209

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:36,250
posting this stuff to my cohort so I'm

57
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,870
not as tall as he is I really want to

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,160
thank all you guys for showing up and

59
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,890
those of you who were here this morning

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,650
heard that we have some new stuff going

61
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:49,328
on a crypto hunt and a lot of prizes and

62
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:52,629
the crypto hunt was a new thing do we

63
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:55,180
have the crypto hunt developers here I

64
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:56,620
see one of them there so we had a team

65
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,040
of three people putting together these

66
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:04,720
challenges with ten questions yeah

67
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,298
that's Dan say thank you Dan we also had

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,769
Miranda and Killian they must not be in

69
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:11,319
the room but they did a fantastic job

70
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,660
and what we're gonna do after is send

71
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,458
out to everyone who registered the

72
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,819
solutions for this you can see what was

73
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,739
involved in it but one thing I noticed

74
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:22,839
was that we had some families and some

75
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,599
kids involved and we didn't expect that

76
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,700
so we really love it when families come

77
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,910
together here and I think that last year

78
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,310
we did the the kids CTF so I think maybe

79
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,870
next year we might do a crypto hunt

80
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,970
geared more towards children and

81
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,920
families as well so what do you guys

82
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,140
think about that

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,640
[Music]

84
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,929
all right so we've got some prizes to

85
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,489
give away and I don't want to like drag

86
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,710
it out for all y'all because we want to

87
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,920
get drinking and dancing and all that

88
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,950
stuff so so we move on to that the fun

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,209
stuff the giveaways so I guess on the

90
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,450
note of crypto hunt we could do that

91
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:02,690
first because that's you know right

92
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:14,929

whole lot of entries Michael and Angela

94
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:25,850
felt okay speaking of families this was

95
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,310
a family effort so it's super cool that

96

actually had similar to a CTF where they

126
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,250
had different challenges based upon

127
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:36,319
coding and can you find the error so

128

for about two and a half hours and what

138
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:19,430
we did is that we had we our company we

139
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,109
provide a gamified learning platform for

140
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,060
developers teaching them how to secure

141
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,860
code and so they can work in their

142
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,250
particular language and framework so

143
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,759

144
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,099

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,349
locate identify vulnerabilities in the

146
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:41,690
code and then going about trying to fix

147
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:44,089

accomplished researcher and a great

345
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:06,290
storyteller if you ever seen in his

346
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,000
YouTube videos he's great at going to

347
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,430
detailing story and also making it funny

348
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,440
taking a boring topic and add humor to

349
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,030
it and excitement today he'll

350
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,370
demonstrate how to manipulate data could

351
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,470
crash a stock market and a lot of fraud

352
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,330
a scale that he'll tell you how to

353
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,250
maliciously act how malicious actors can

354
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,070
manipulate your Identity Management to

355
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,330
access your servers and of course he'll

356
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,820
show you how to protect yourself from

357
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:33,189
such from these from these type of

358
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:35,870
attacks sorry he's a senior security

359
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,850
associate focus on red team and a

360
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,919
dedicated member of the R&D team at

361
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,379
Bishop Fox when largest professional

362
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,810
services firm focus on offensive

363
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,520
security testing he also serves as a

364
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,190
primary forensic investigator for the

365
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,230
DoD's largest data center grant has

366
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,750
spoken at large conferences blackhat the

367
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,760
USA and DEF CON so once again everyone

368
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,160
please stand up let's give a large

369
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,020
b-side Tampa round of applause to our

370
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,020
closing keynote Rhett Greenberg

371
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,900
it's green Hagan by the way not

372
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,959
greenberg just we're on the same page

373
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,959
[Music]

374
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:34,289
[Music]

375
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:36,869
thank you I've been coming to b-sides

376
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:39,929
Tampa since I'd say I think the first

377
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:42,590
ones in 2014 was at the class right how

378
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:46,080
many people here are students from user

379
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:48,149
some on earth others gonna be that's

380
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,049
that's actually kind of impressive be

381
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:52,018
honest I thought one me like two or

382
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:53,759
three this talk just isn't about hacking

383
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:56,249
AI and machine learning this talk is

384
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,950
about changing the specific mindset and

385
00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:00,690
be able to change that mindset of what

386
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,460
you currently have and exploit other

387
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:04,799
systems new systems that even come out

388
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,039
yet things that are still being

389
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,929
developed talk about changing the

390
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,979
mindset for a seventh for a second from

391
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:12,899
a student basis for people who are

392
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:15,149
looking to become pen testers or red

393
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:16,978
teamers themselves it takes a specific

394
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:19,678
knowledge set to be able to understand

395
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:20,879
how the network works how a computer

396
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,320
communicates with another computer on

397
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:25,320
the network the the absolute basics

398
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,668
right once you start to understand the

399
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,559
basics and you research these new

400
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:30,090
concepts like artificial intelligence

401
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,220
and how you how to build it in desert

402
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,439
and all these other cool things you can

403
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,999
start to apply that knowledge but one of

404
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,489
the big things for people who are just

405
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:42,059
trying to become pen tester is there's a

406
00:25:38,489 --> 00:25:43,349
lack of I'm not gonna say member service

407
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,168
but there's a lack of things out there

408
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:48,359
to try and help you understand the basic

409
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,309
infrastructure and the basement ology to

410
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,590
the biggest things that I can all

411
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:53,668
honestly say that I even I'm the big fan

412
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,678
of is hack the box is another Croft

413
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,450
those are that's that one's a public

414
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,090
service right another one's an online

415
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,519
service with those two you can start to

416
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,178
learn how how systems are communicated

417
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,399
back and forth

418
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:10,139
how basic administration privileges work

419
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:13,439
these easy things so but this talk about

420
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:15,379
this talk is about specifically how we

421
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,350
attacked the stock market for a client

422
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:20,719
how we are able to metabolize stock

423
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:27,110
how we're able to bypass SEC framework

424
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:29,029
SEC standpoints but one of the biggest

425
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,070
things you understand is how world

426
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:34,720
events and open-source intelligence

427
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:37,519
social media all these things can cause

428
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,289
complete chaos in the stock market not

429
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,360
just the Knighton that took you

430
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,860
exchanged not even just the nura I'm

431
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,158
talking about the world market as a

432
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,070
whole and whenever you're able to

433
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,259
understand the technical aspects and the

434
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,309
human behavior from let's say the basics

435
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:54,470
which we were which I was just talking

436
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:56,418
about you can start playing the social

437
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,850
engine caste aspect and thanks it is

438
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:01,820
artificial intelligence because when it

439
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,259
comes to advanced attacks all these you

440
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,950
have to other than streaming the basics

441
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:08,690
a little bit about me I've got 15 years

442
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:14,149
and intelligence in the US until his

443
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:15,799
community I was a part of the team that

444
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:17,809
did the attacking it's the first the

445
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,908
first connect strike against a hacker

446
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:23,059
and I said the Twitter above Isis

447
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:25,100
recruiter that was using Twitter I did

448
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:27,049
the Fitbit research that showed Knapp

449
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:31,039
toe around military bases and classify

450
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:36,110
co-locations in East Africa I gave a

451
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,700
talk on on how to be a I'm sorry the

452
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:41,299
spies who didn't love me talking about

453
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,250
this is my thought can talk about for

454
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:44,570
intellij cheese using dating application

455
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,340
specifically things like Grindr and

456
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,529
scruff to target closeted homosexuals

457
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,120
around classified military locations and

458
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:54,350
be able to portray classified

459
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,149
information just for really quick what

460
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,939
artificial intelligence is there there's

461
00:27:56,149 --> 00:28:00,649
kind of a bigger aspect to AI than just

462
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,480
AI machine learning deep learning neural

463
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:04,908
networks there's a data science

464
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,070
component that people really don't seem

465
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:09,379
to grasp because without the data

466
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:12,080
science portion of being able to create

467
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:14,149
pools of data say it'd be like the past

468
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,908
15 years of the stock market how how

469
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:19,570
trays have happened talk about the last

470
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:23,179
75 years of how one specific action

471
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:28,779
caused the causation of the stock market

472
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:31,570
talk about how how a social media post a

473
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:33,009
compromised social media profile

474
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,408
let's say ap News which we'll talk about

475
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:37,149
later how that can cause a world market

476
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:39,179
event and cause the market to lose one

477
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:43,748
point seven billion dollars and I

478
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,850
believe it was 17 minutes Wow data

479
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:48,159
science civically plays into artificial

480
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,928
intelligent machine learning is to be

481
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,519
able to train the models for artificial

482
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:54,580
intelligence you have to have a data

483
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:57,639
pool to be able to find the the the

484
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,879
noise and the data so specifically for

485
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:02,738
let's say the data science portion you

486
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:04,719
have you have structured and

487
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:06,279
unstructured data the structured data

488
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,470
you think of an Excel spreadsheet with

489
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:12,399
your different tables things like time

490
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:15,639
of tying the stock name things like that

491
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,049
you can think of unstructured data as a

492
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:19,508
let's say a Mars

493
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:21,539
a Mars device that's just collecting

494
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:24,849
metadata and put it into a specific form

495
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:26,529
be able to take large amounts of data

496
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:29,168
from a different collection standpoint

497
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:31,029
even at that point even the noise starts

498
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:33,549
to become a pattern you can you can

499
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:36,269
start to understand the noise aspect to

500
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:38,440
how the noise is causing causing

501
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:42,909
behavior that which wouldn't be seen

502
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:46,419
anywhere else like I think another

503
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:48,759
example we see a lot of noise in network

504
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:51,609
locks lot of just random crap I wish we

505
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:53,590
could just remove even at a point to

506
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:56,199
where you have largest say let's say 200

507
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,999
terabytes of network logs you start to

508
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,710
see even the noise is starting to

509
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:05,379
starting a pattern makes sense and even

510
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,159
with the big data concept you can create

511
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:11,649
a bigger and more precise decision

512
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,159
talking about AI for a second picture of

513
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:16,748
the daily stock data as the the

514
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:19,090
collection standpoint how social media

515
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:21,220
is coming in how the Bloomberg data

516
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,488
which we'll talk about later how it

517
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,229
crates market events so the daily stock

518
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,289
data is your your data science model

519
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:31,359
right in the predictive system of which

520
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:32,710
is looking at predictive behavior based

521
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,039
off of the data that's already been

522
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,320
adjusted with the predictive system you

523
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,970
can start becoming more aware of what a

524
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,029
stock might possibly do to a certain

525
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,220
degree like for example if you were to

526
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:47,030
take the 15 years stock database and see

527
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,830
Nasdaq was gonna operate within a

528
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,020
three-day time period you can see

529
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,580
specifically where it should be work was

530
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,490
compared to be in a ratio based

531
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,929
percentage based off of that and talking

532
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,980
about the machine learning aspect just

533
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:02,030
for a second the difference between

534
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,620
machine learning and deep learning is

535
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,690
machine learning you're still you're

536
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,760
still creating the rules yourself this

537
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,740
is a screenshot from mine from my Azure

538
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,080
framework where I've created rules to

539
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:17,120
tell me when a stock goes to let's say

540
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,129
10% right - to create an action or to

541
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,360
make me aware that's really the biggest

542
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,650
difference between machine learning and

543
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:27,679
deep learning deep learning the rules

544
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:29,690
can create themselves talking about the

545
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,250
specific attacks on the stock markets

546
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:36,710
these are these are probably their two

547
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:39,590
major ones in a 17 minute time frame the

548
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:42,020
the middle-eastern actors were actually

549
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:46,189
able to manipulate the market based off

550
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:47,870
of a tweet in before it took 16 min or

551
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,490
17 minutes of SEC to find that out and

552
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,679
regulate it and they were able to steal

553
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:55,160
136 billion based off of the other

554
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:58,730
stocks which they were invested in and

555
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:01,130
this happened back in 2013 they used a

556
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:03,200
they used a bypass that got passed the

557
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,340
the dual factor authentication things

558
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,520
phishing or something like that I

559
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,050
believe from from this tweet that was

560
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,970
saying that there was an explosion at

561
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,760
the White House

562
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:16,760
he immediately from a 14 to 18 second

563
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,530
time frame the the stock dropped around

564
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,270
36 37 percent and this is this is Dow

565
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:23,629
Jones this is we're not talking about

566
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:27,860
like Apple or or the bones we're talking

567
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:29,780
about we're talk about Dow Jones another

568
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,550
example is how they were able to steal

569
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,980
1.2 billion over a 16 week time frame

570
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,080
before they were caught this type of

571
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,960
method would be more of stealing the

572
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,020
model the Train model in which in which

573
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,480
a firm is using to be able to predict

574
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,330
what a stock's gonna do if I was I'd be

575
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,180
able to get a hold of that model and in

576
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:52,550
reverse it I could see I could see okay

577
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,530
so the rule the rule is set up to where

578
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:58,320
if Tesla goes down 20% they see

579
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:01,590
everything I can manipulate that because

580
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,820
I can go myself go buy whatever 22

581
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,580
percent just to be able to do that for a

582
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,570
threshold then immediately sell it the

583
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,030
rules aren't gonna be able know what

584
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:13,050
happened which means I can come back

585
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:15,450
rebuy it for half the price and make if

586
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:18,720
I was to spend 1.2 million dollars

587
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,250
I come out making 136 million 137

588
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,590
million something works somewhere close

589
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,620
based off manipulating their model right

590
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,959
that's a that's a really big thing

591
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,510
that's going on right now is specific

592
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,330
Asian actors such a PD actors but cyber

593
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,650
crime actors looking at firms that are

594
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,360
low hanging fruit to work so they can

595
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,640
still their model and be able to sell

596
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,020
that model currently those models are

597
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,980
going around from five hundred six five

598
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,250
hundred thousand sixteen thousand

599
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,860
dollars on the black market right now um

600
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,530
a little bit about Wall Street not to

601
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,449
annoy you guys or anything but the

602
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:54,270
biggest thing here is the dashboards

603
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,740
that they look at they consider a 100

604
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:59,310
percent fact they believe it's the Holy

605
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,800
Bible they will not think for a second

606
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,899
or hesitate and sell something buy sell

607
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,330
something based off of what one of the

608
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,010
billboard says so one of the tax we did

609
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,630
was actually gaining control over the

610
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:13,409
type of software of the back end that

611
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:15,630
changes off trading hours by the way of

612
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,000
what the Billboard would say we'll show

613
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:22,890
examples in here a second but one of the

614
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,570
biggest things like I said is how they

615
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,549
trust these systems without a doubt

616
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:29,159
because they have seconds to make

617
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:33,899
decisions seconds equal dollars on the

618
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:37,260
trading floor one of the biggest things

619
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,719
that is used from day traders to to

620
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,220
anybody in everybody who takes manage of

621
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,500
the stock market to a certain degree is

622
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:47,399
the Bloomberg terminal the Bloomberg

623
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,350
terminal is is by far the biggest melt

624
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:53,790
most well-known source of information

625
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:55,739
for traders so there's about half a

626
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,020
million Bluebird terminals right now and

627
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,120
even more in users these Bloomberg

628
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,270
terminals have things like instant

629
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,950
messaging you

630
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,110
and you have your own specific profile

631
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,910
you log into you can see what your

632
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,860
trades are currently doing you can see

633
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,450
the behavior the past financial behavior

634
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,800
on that stock you can see the price

635
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,189
table on that stuff from the last fiscal

636
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,250
year you can even see the news the AP

637
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:21,400
CNN Fox News John wants disclose cup

638
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,930
different different news and how those

639
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,070
specific news articles are affecting

640
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:29,589
your specific stuff that you're looking

641
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:31,360
at so from a red steam standpoint one of

642
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,910
the big one of the first ones we did was

643
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,590
the poison attack our four objectives

644
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,200
were to manipulate the specific data

645
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:41,020
pool use a small footprint that would

646
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,250
bypass the SEC rolls and frames are

647
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,009
currently put in place to be able to

648
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,350
halt specific actions on a live trading

649
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,180
floor keep trades alive for one week

650
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,279
because if we were able to show the SEC

651
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,279
or the client that we're able to do it

652
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,990
for one week there's a there's about 86

653
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,400
to 87 percent chance that were more

654
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,899
likely to go from a long term ur than

655
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,210
that because most of these fraudulent

656
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,490
charges happen within the first day or

657
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:08,020
two days or even the first 48 hours and

658
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,370
the other thing was working in the paper

659
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,759
trading environment paper trade

660
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:16,210
environment think of a secure framework

661
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,800
a secure way to trade stock play stock

662
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,150
manipulate see all the tool work see how

663
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,910
the trade works based off of specific

664
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,170
actions there's about I'd say 10% of the

665
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:26,640
people who like they're mostly day

666
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:29,590
traders who use the Uzis terminals and

667
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,089
try and build patterns and I under I

668
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:37,150
understand ideas of how the stocks were

669
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:38,770
gonna be able to react so one of the one

670
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,090
of the quickest ways that we could find

671
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,680
was not to go after the Bloomberg

672
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,910
terminal but go after a different

673
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,129
corrupt terminal call Interactive

674
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,190
Brokers so the Bloomberg terminal is

675
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,110
about $25,000 a user a month and the

676
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,220
Interactive Brokers is about $13 month

677
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,680
but hold on it's actually really cooler

678
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:57,520
when you pay $13 a month you end up

679
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,940
beating the Bloomberg data theme and the

680
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:05,350
thing is we were going after smaller

681
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:07,240
smaller terminals to try and bypass SEC

682
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:08,860
and try and not make FCC aware even

683
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,029
though was paper trading they were still

684
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,350
the ones that were trying to find the

685
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,900
specific action that we were doing and

686
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,660
trying to see if we could bypass there

687
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,280
deep learning and deep learning and

688
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,140
other neural networks for stay up in

689
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,400
place we didn't talk about deep learn

690
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,960
and neural network specifically because

691
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,380
they're mostly used for auditing

692
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,930
purposes to to see if a specific trader

693
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,850
is buying stock based off of a specific

694
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,020
email he received or that type of stuff

695
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:34,290
and that's not really something we're

696
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,870
going into the internet your brokers

697
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,390
model is kind of a little bit different

698
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:42,900
but the thing here is on the bottom

699
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:45,060
right it's more of your newsfeed and on

700
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,310
the top left is how your stocks Curly

701
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,259
interacting instead of fabulous set up

702
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,180
like a Bloomberg terminal Bloomberg

703
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,100
terminal yep multiple monitors with the

704
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,210
Interactive Brokers you can access it

705
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,680
anywhere you don't have that a secure

706
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,980
terminal you just log into a website

707
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,500
that's the biggest thing and from from

708
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,120
the software that produces this data on

709
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,820
to the billboards which people are using

710
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,319
to buy or sale there's other ways of

711
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,150
being able to manipulate that manipulate

712
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,670
that data to specifically change their

713
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,380
to change the human behavior there's a

714
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:16,890
reason why I talked about understanding

715
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,070
the basics at the end of this talk these

716
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,089
these ideas and concepts that you learn

717
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,590
when your student when you're a beginner

718
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,050
when you're just getting your first gig

719
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,920
can be inputted into more than just what

720
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,080
you're learning for specific data

721
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,450
poisoning attacks like for Dena Dena

722
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,000
it's poisoning the idea in concept is

723
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:36,200
quite still the same but you can change

724
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,690
it to new things such as such as

725
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,310
poisoning a specific data pool the only

726
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,320
difference is be able to research how is

727
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:45,090
ur and how you upload and how you relate

728
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,560
to the data in the program there's

729
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,760
really there's really no difference it's

730
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,380
really not as advanced as everyone

731
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,350
thinks it is the ideas and the concepts

732
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,330
are advanced but the the how you adapt

733
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:56,520
them for what you need is is not as

734
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,590
harder one things so here we were able

735
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,110
to see what the RSS feed was currently

736
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:02,580
pulling down and manipulated manipulated

737
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,800
the RSS feed to say what we wanted to

738
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,940
say but to get to that point we need to

739
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,100
get login credentials so what we used

740
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,290
with Go Fish we specifically fished the

741
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,299
company got there got their account

742
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,310
login from the account login we

743
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,440
manipulated the our system supplier and

744
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:19,290
from the RSS apply we're able to change

745
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,069
and send a Sindhi broad alert out that

746
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,630
says

747
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:25,079
declares war on the united states sell

748
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:27,089
sell sell from that you're able to see

749
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,979
all everyone's order entries that are

750
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:31,109
currently selling all the OpCo stuff

751
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:33,779
that they have Akko is oil and gas

752
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:37,259
that's them or I might be pronouncing it

753
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:39,690
wrong but imagine imagine someone's seen

754
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:41,160
that RSS feed and then Miele selling all

755
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,839
that stuff that I currently have but the

756
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,729
thing is when you sell stock you're not

757
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,869
scope it in a bank account when you sell

758
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:47,160
stock you're manipulating you're

759
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:50,940
changing that stock and implement into

760
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,259
other things other stocks right so once

761
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,619
that happened we start to see the other

762
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:58,289
stocks try to go more up we see the SP

763
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,089
index go up by point 39% we see Amazon

764
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:06,410
go up by one point two five percent all

765
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:09,269
the stocks went up not just one so from

766
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,819
from Nessun area we created another one

767
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:14,249
within the time frame with we had which

768
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:16,288
was the modeling operation our goal was

769
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:18,448
to steal a trained machine machine

770
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:21,509
learning model from a major firm on the

771
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:23,099
New York Stock Exchange manipulate the

772
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:24,839
stock neatly I'm sorry manipulate the

773
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:26,789
model to say what we wanted to say

774
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,369
because we specifically wanted them to

775
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:33,029
sell a specific stock and buy another

776
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:36,449
stock while we in turn bought the

777
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:38,400
opposite and sold the opposite right and

778
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:40,619
another thing was to go in notice

779
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,529
because if we weren't gonna notice based

780
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,209
off of the SEC regulations that stock

781
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:46,140
would not have been readjusted we still

782
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,249
would have kept the money that we would

783
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,279
have made if it was with a certain time

784
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:54,839
frame so how we started was we use the

785
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:57,449
the steal of machine learning hub which

786
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:58,680
the guy is absolutely incredible care I

787
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:00,569
could be I couldn't be more impressed

788
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,538
with he create us actually gave a talk

789
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:04,949
about specifically how to use it what we

790
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:06,509
did was we were actually able to find

791
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:07,709
the AWS bucket that was currently being

792
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:10,469
used to be able to manipulate the data

793
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:12,629
did a response to pull it down and then

794
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:14,789
we retrain the model based off what we

795
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,979
wanted to do once we trained the model

796
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:18,930
we returned the modified model to their

797
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:20,609
AWS bucket and gave it time to

798
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,779
repopulate but the thing is you have to

799
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:23,808
do a denial of service attack against

800
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:27,150
the specific service to get it to stop

801
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:30,059
right so once it stops it restarts it

802
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:31,529
pulls the new model in so this is a

803
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:33,059
before and after or what the stock

804
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:33,830
currently after what sure we manipulated

805
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,830
it

806
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,299
so the before is you see how Ted this

807
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:42,740
was back when Tesla was going skyress

808
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:46,400
cut off the roof the buy is the test of

809
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,959
the cell is the AMD right once we knew

810
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,270
plate the mine I know the right one

811
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,500
looks really janky I sincerely apologize

812
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,360
this is the best you can do whenever you

813
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,570
just throw Cranham crab in someone's

814
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:58,520
model this month but what we wanted to

815
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:01,130
do is we want Tesla to go down at AMD to

816
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,800
go up because we were selling all of our

817
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:07,130
AMD once they bought and we were selling

818
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,440
all our dollar Tesla once they sold so

819
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,330
from that standpoint from from the paper

820
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,340
trading which is fake money we were able

821
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:18,230
to score 282 million dollars and change

822
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,720
this is the before and after of the

823
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,580
specific model what you're looking here

824
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,250
is the volatility right well you're

825
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,630
specifically you're looking at is the

826
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,850
they're all these dots are talking

827
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,470
touching each other right you see the

828
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,690
four dots that are not touching each

829
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:35,480
other that means us out of the out of

830
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:37,700
the concise recognition of the algorithm

831
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,260
itself if you were able to look at this

832
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,490
if I was a data signed analyst and I saw

833
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,940
this four dots I would be scared

834
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:44,899
shitless because that means something

835
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,280
was in to manipulate something was

836
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,620
amending play because it's changes out

837
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,750
of the human behavior so another thing

838
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,990
you had to do was go change their

839
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:55,670
dashboard to show what we wanted to show

840
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:58,660
so instead of them seeing this which we

841
00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:00,980
deleted the data for they saw this

842
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,990
because we want them to be able to go

843
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,640
long-term without seeing their we want

844
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,109
to we want them to see their dashboard

845
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,920
which they look at on an hourly basis

846
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:11,870
and say oh looks normal so instead

847
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,330
we change it to this which is just

848
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:17,060
another data feed that just rotates

849
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:19,100
around and what you see is at the very

850
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:21,350
end that is how they bought right and

851
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:27,970
how we sold and the total amount which

852
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:29,839
was about I think be 155 per stock the

853
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,890
conclusion of specifically all this is

854
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,830
machine learning systems are vulnerable

855
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,299
to attacks and their data sources an

856
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:37,009
imagine imagine hacking necks of

857
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,410
directory server right you gain access

858
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:41,750
to the machine you gain access to the ad

859
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,040
server again exited GPU policy from that

860
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,359
you once start to manipulate users

861
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,579
create yourself easier

862
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:48,339
great persistence right there's no

863
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:50,509
difference there's no difference between

864
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:51,920
machine learning artificial intelligence

865
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:54,410
other than the name in the buzzwords

866
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,809
they're still computers they're still

867
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,859
computers that have ports open users

868
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:58,700
that are willing to give you credentials

869
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:01,400
because they think they're going to go

870
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,799
sign up for a puppy spot account there's

871
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,989
there's legitimate actions that you can

872
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:07,400
change change and take original ideas

873
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:09,499
and original attack concepts and

874
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,890
implement into your new mythology and at

875
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:14,328
work the the threat is real unnaturally

876
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,960
being exploited in the wild that's

877
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:19,519
showed by the news articles of beginning

878
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,410
firms on Wall Street Journal and the

879
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,348
nickel index are being attacked daily

880
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:27,410
they're spending more money than some

881
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:29,299
militaries on digital security and the

882
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,819
type of attacks based off of their

883
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:36,829
region is the same as financial sector

884
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:38,930
and high-tech sector and the thing that

885
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:41,029
can be mitigated is really starting with

886
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:42,950
the development of the systems and the

887
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:45,220
security of the systems and treating

888
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:47,538
them the way you treat your Holy Grail

889
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,279
some people worry about their exchange

890
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:50,359
servers some people worry about their 80

891
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:53,269
servers some people worry about their

892
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:56,420
FTP server you need to treat it secure

893
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:58,808
treat us securely and not allow it to

894
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:02,690
have unsecure protections based off of

895
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:04,099
what whatever's Joe Blow says the

896
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,499
system's need to be treated the same as

897
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:08,059
everything else not be able to say I

898
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:09,049
want to leave this specific port open

899
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:13,039
because I need to call back to my cell

900
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:15,170
phone or my blackberry but I want to say

901
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,440
special thanks to Matt Keely dan patro

902
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,940
dan wood problem with this talk in the

903
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,339
reflux research team I couldn't done

904
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,569
without them I really appreciate you

905
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:25,430
guys taking the time sit here listen

906
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:26,599
like everyone got up and left I think

907
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:32,930
I've said some of my start using

908
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:35,710
profanity but uh but no jokes thank you

909
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,710
thanks for inviting

910
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:59,550
I disagree and agree not most I'd say

911
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,860
about a quarter right now you're seeing

912
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:07,560
but about 24 to 26 percent moving to

913
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:08,750
moving there I'm sorry I forgot the

914
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:41,190
question

915
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:42,570
dude come on the difference god I feel

916
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,460
like I'm getting married and I forgot

917
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:47,040
the lines now I'm kidding I'm kidding

918
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,230
no the question the question was there

919
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,150
was being co-located data centers from

920
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:52,290
like from internal customers and how in

921
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,570
the differences between protecting them

922
00:46:52,290 --> 00:47:00,210
and protecting AWS d'azyr and other

923
00:46:54,570 --> 00:47:02,190
platforms correct yeah the biggest

924
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:04,440
difference I would say is the user base

925
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:06,990
a lot of user bases whenever you do red

926
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,180
team's on specific AWS or or reserved

927
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:12,120
there's there's only a specific

928
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:14,700
limitation you can go to so your whole

929
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,710
to test like black box testing more from

930
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,879
a Colo location your be able to you're

931
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,130
having to go towards the specific

932
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,690
engineers themselves not talking about

933
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,920
physical access not talking about social

934
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,870
engineering still be talking about the

935
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,690
infrastructure that held subs in place

936
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:29,640
there's more low-hanging fruit when it

937
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,470
comes to Azure and machine learning

938
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,330
I'm sorry is there and maybe you asked

939
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,890
specifically because the way the data

940
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:38,100
science portion is set up how they're

941
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:40,290
collecting data from AWS in Azure and

942
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,870
other platforms like that their newsfeed

943
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,580
they're like some firms specifically

944
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,529
look at social media right and have the

945
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,900
APS the way they're ingesting the data

946
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,480
is the biggest thing in my opinion based

947
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,730
off of the engagements we've done now

948
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,510
from a co-located application from

949
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,410
a colo located at a data center near the

950
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,020
company you're talking about the large

951
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:02,279
financial sector it's usually based off

952
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,200
the tackiness Pacific engineers

953
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,000
themselves because at that point they

954
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,740
have access they expect complete access

955
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,660
control firewall from the firewall

956
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,609
endpoints to the actual model themself

957
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,410
and how they're being trained so one

958
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:14,730
thing that current that current

959
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,740
financial institutions are doing is

960
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,300
they're having the black box the black

961
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,680
box that no one touches that has no air

962
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,420
at connection or they try and make it as

963
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,868
secure as I can right but the thing is

964
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,520
I'd say out of the seven attacks I'd say

965
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:29,310
for those attacks are going after the

966
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:33,380
engineer themselves that's my that's

967
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:33,380
that's my key point that I missed you oh

968
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,409
[Music]

969
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:50,820
these ones oh oh oh oh

970
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:53,850
 no seriously no seriously one woman

971
00:48:50,820 --> 00:49:02,369
started crying walked out because she

972
00:48:53,850 --> 00:49:03,450
knew she's losing her job please don't

973
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,859
take this the wrong way or meat meat is

974
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,850
respectful I know I cracked up because

975
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,770
I'm scared shitless right now I'm on

976
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,630
stage but when it come I was never

977
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:11,040
administrator I was never I was never in

978
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,690
ever chemist Reiter I was an operator I

979
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,480
work for special operations I worked

980
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:18,750
with NSA twice I worked at CIA like I I

981
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,950
was never I don't know I can tell you

982
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,510
how I did it and try to help you your

983
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:23,700
best protected but when it comes to

984
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:26,600
trying to protect it from before I pen

985
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:29,160
test oh dude you have better luck or

986
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,589
offering the guy from Wendy's of cooks

987
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,600
fries of the job like I that's not

988
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:54,840
that's not my expertise I legitimately

989
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:57,150
only attack oh oh no no no no no no no

990
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,100
no not during the attack at all there

991
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:01,859
was one they were like huh these are

992
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:04,150
some weird puppy spot emails like that

993
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:06,098
was that was really it right

994
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,960
look like ever like everyone thought I'm

995
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:10,000
gonna buy a Siberian Husky did someone

996
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:14,140
register the corporate account a poppy

997
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,579
spot calm like that was dude I'm you

998
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,609
have to understand I don't have the

999
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:20,980
traditional the traditional training my

1000
00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:23,109
first job was with the OJ when I mean

1001
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,520
after I turn 18 I've been a red teamer

1002
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:26,230
breaking in class by military locations

1003
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,750
military bases around the world my

1004
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,910
entire career like I don't know like I

1005
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:33,039
never I'll put it like this I do not

1006
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:36,069
know any legitimate Twitter account I've

1007
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,859
never created a legitimate website does

1008
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:40,150
it make sense but from the correcting

1009
00:50:38,859 --> 00:50:43,240
actions

1010
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:45,910
it was mostly I'd say 8% user behavior

1011
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:50,890
and user awareness and be able to put

1012
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:52,660
more SEC SEC frameworks in place based

1013
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:53,828
off of data ingestion from outside

1014
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:57,339
sources that they don't have control of

1015
00:50:53,829 --> 00:51:00,670
like like their John Franz CNN AP news

1016
00:50:57,339 --> 00:51:02,890
right there's no there's no there's no

1017
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:06,359
protection other than after the point

1018
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,359
right there's no verification purposes

1019
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:26,859
I actually know how to answer that I

1020
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,328
don't mean be disrespectful or anything

1021
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:30,598
like that but I mean I think that's I

1022
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:34,869
think that's touching on on client data

1023
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:37,440
on customer data I would say that user

1024
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:37,440
awareness

1025
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,080
you

1026
00:51:51,300 --> 00:52:01,110
was probably the biggest piece questions

1027
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:23,850
come on I love questions can we teach a

1028
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:26,400
show-up I'm kidding sir sure that's

1029
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:29,040
that's actually false that's actually

1030
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:33,630
false they sign up they sign I'd say one

1031
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:55,500
out of 12 one out of 13 I'm sorry okay

1032
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:57,000
oh yeah oh yeah and the thing is eating

1033
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,140
on barzola intelligence you can break

1034
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,490
out specifically look at the carafe

1035
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,839
about where it came from and that's

1036
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,979
really where that's really where the

1037
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:07,320
interacting come to interact it becomes

1038
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:28,350
place because whenever you see oh yeah

1039
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:30,950
no questions no it's not okay yeah dude

1040
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,950
no seriously

1041
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,359
[Music]

1042
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:45,120
[Music]

1043
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,040
there was an excellent DEFCON talk last

1044
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:59,109
year on that

1045
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:03,069
I'm sorry not last year oh what

1046
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:04,690
your zit two years ago it was a it was a

1047
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:06,609
sky talks talk she actually end up

1048
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:12,220
putting her slides out it's something

1049
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:14,440
about something about how I unless she's

1050
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:17,709
at least malicious add by for something

1051
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,059
for some exchange honestly like she's I

1052
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,809
look up too early and she's extremely

1053
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:22,839
intelligent

1054
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:25,349
she knows her that's that's by far

1055
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:35,828
I say go but yes I agree with you

1056
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:37,510
questions questions sir know one of the

1057
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:39,400
one of the objectives was to do it was

1058
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:42,900
it was called a paper trading format

1059
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:46,180
think of a think of a virtual network

1060
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:47,470
that you set aside to to break into now

1061
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,410
you get that you grown and ransomware

1062
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:52,118
and play route right that's what we did

1063
00:54:50,410 --> 00:55:11,859
it was um thinking about you table up

1064
00:54:52,119 --> 00:55:25,359
and trust yes sure

1065
00:55:11,859 --> 00:55:26,890
so that there swing oh no I'm sorry sure

1066
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,450
one second let me let me let me change

1067
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,740
your mind for a second so the thing is

1068
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,720
one of the reasons why we went to

1069
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,490
interact or broke us for is because of

1070
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,779
the different people who use it so be

1071
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:36,339
able to change the feed and be able to

1072
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,890
send it that way we can control more

1073
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:40,540
than him in a national market event be

1074
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:42,790
able to see the manipulation of the data

1075
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,680
is based of the other people who are on

1076
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,730
the paper trading accounts so there's

1077
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,379
another thing about interactive

1078
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:49,660
Interactive Brokers is there's a portion

1079
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,270
called paper trading to our ego test

1080
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,980
based off what the current and what the

1081
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,720
current market value is and pest and

1082
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,369
past market value this so we're a minute

1083
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,308
maybe we're manipulating those users

1084
00:55:57,369 --> 00:56:02,020
right not live users because we don't

1085
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:06,180
want to I mean one thing would be highly

1086
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,180
illegal second thing would cause market

1087
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:24,270
yes I mean I made that pretty clear on

1088
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:25,950
slide six I disagree and I mean no

1089
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,210
disrespect but the one the biggest

1090
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,770
things about interactive brokers and how

1091
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,930
the paper trading is people who are day

1092
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:31,980
traders you do paper trading because

1093
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,970
it's their own there's their own

1094
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,870
$20,000.00

1095
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,830
because you have to have a limit of

1096
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:37,049
twenty thousand dollars to be able to

1097
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:39,660
you know I mean so what these day

1098
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:41,370
traders do is they test new theories new

1099
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:44,220
ideas they have new notes that they've

1100
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:46,109
created and be able to manipulate based

1101
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,930
off what they it's it's called paper

1102
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:51,330
trading right because it's paper you can

1103
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:55,259
delete it but it's for testing purposes

1104
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:58,770
only right if you were to have I'd see a

1105
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:04,440
ratio I say for every five day traders

1106
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:06,720
outside firms collection firms I'd say

1107
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,030
one out of six of those new paper

1108
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,740
trading or at least have a specific team

1109
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,970
who do paper trading because it's not

1110
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,189
just a mythology that's just used for

1111
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:26,009
interactive brokers it's used for the

1112
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:39,830
market in general I disagree I'm sorry I

1113
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:41,790
mean I I just I just disagree okay okay

1114
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:53,049
okay was there another question to that

1115
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:54,460
or you done okay well I welcome your

1116
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:56,320
Baxter but there's also client data that

1117
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,460
I can't I can't discuss and that's one

1118
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,630
of the reasons why there's specific

1119
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:01,150
scenarios here and something's been

1120
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:02,560
removed but I mean I did the best that I

1121
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,090
could to be able to explain my portfolio

1122
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,860
what you've done or would give something

1123
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:07,860
else you're done sir

1124
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:20,770
yeah but to to the percentage to where

1125
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,810
you have to keep in mind the assumption

1126
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,580
is I see this dashboard I'm gonna listen

1127
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,930
to it I'm gonna believe it right so

1128
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,420
manipulating to the point to that

1129
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,399
dashboard and other people's dashboards

1130
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:32,650
right but the thing is the problem is if

1131
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,290
you were actually go verify this or go

1132
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,600
google it because what people learn from

1133
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:39,460
the 1.7 billion or in that 17 minute

1134
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,049
time frame when when malicious actors

1135
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:43,390
from middle-east created right in 2013

1136
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:47,290
is we should have checked this on

1137
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:50,109
Twitter here and I mean in my viewpoint

1138
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:52,210
now that's more change because there's a

1139
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:54,580
direct correlation between business

1140
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:55,720
intelligence and open source

1141
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,680
intelligence when it comes to

1142
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,569
understanding to be able to use that

1143
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:07,660
intelligence for stupid trade and making

1144
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:10,990
money get a question I'm sorry yes and

1145
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:13,149
no some are ones are public summer one I

1146
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:15,669
think we created two that were the one

1147
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:18,160
that we interjected we had to manipulate

1148
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,320
we have the one we manipulate are you

1149
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,080
uploaded it it was their original model

1150
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,000
we just manipulate the data inside of it

1151
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,370
because it needs to work and look look

1152
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,380
as close as it can because if we are a

1153
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:31,240
bubble that Mara that malam and they

1154
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,010
pull it up into their dashboard it's

1155
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:36,040
gonna be like we were never trading

1156
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:37,810
whatever whatever porn website I can't

1157
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,580
come to my mind but like there's like

1158
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:41,140
there's a reason right there's a user

1159
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,230
behavior aspect to this and be able to

1160
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,230
manipulate
