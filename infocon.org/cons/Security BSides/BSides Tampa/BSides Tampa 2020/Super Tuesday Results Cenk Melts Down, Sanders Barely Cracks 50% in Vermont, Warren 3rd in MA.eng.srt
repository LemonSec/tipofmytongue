1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,980
all right everyone the moment you've all

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,710
been waiting for Super Tuesday fallout

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,360
here it's it's like another Christmas

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,429
it's better than Christmas this is

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,840
pretty much the best I could have

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,509
possibly hoped for

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,948
going into this I predicted Joe Biden

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,630
would outperform and I said he would

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,789
need four states in order to remain

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,220
viable he'd probably get a bit over that

11
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,980
I don't think anyone expected him to

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,080
actually get possibly nine states on

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,150
Super Tuesday so my prediction was right

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,040
but I was being too conservative and I

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,680
think I have that tendency some time to

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,710
underestimate ball swinging number two

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,530
Schenk melts down number three Elizabeth

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,719
Warren comes in third third in her own

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,789
state not only she didn't even come in

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,620
second she didn't even come in close

21
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,809
she's like more than ten points behind

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,280
the front or Biden manages to win I

23
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,500
figured that that one would probably be

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,329
for Sanders because he had been running

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,980
a couple points out of Warren and Biden

26
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,690
would be a close third it was it was

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,120
fairly packed up but the fact that she

28
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,980
can't even win her own home state send

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,809
her packing to all of the Elizabeth

30
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,330
Warren fans I know you're very salty and

31
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,310
yes I am going to troll you to pieces on

32
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,380
Twitter for hours and hours today I mean

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,330
have a great time you gotta get her to

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,009
drop out she's just gonna get humiliated

35
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,770
if she stays in there's no path to

36
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,479
victory for hell there's barely a path

37
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,310
to victory for Sanders at this point

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,869
after this I'm gonna go through this it

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,840
might be a long rant here it's gonna be

40
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,220
a funny one too so stay tuned I think

41
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,439
the biggest news of the night though

42
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,210
here the whole this this one warms the

43
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,250
cockles of my heart I've been talking

44
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,020
for months to Bernie Sanders fans and

45
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,360
whenever I talk to them I say look I'm

46
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,070
one of Sanders constituents and I'm

47
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,750
telling you that Bernie Sanders isn't

48
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,399
even universally accepted in his home

49
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,280
state and they always brushed it aside

50
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,079
so why do Vermonters compli electing him

51
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,820
and hit point out there's a difference

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,380
but demographically is a huge difference

53
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,720
between Vermonters in the nation number

54
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,710
one so get that out of my face number

55
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,000
two you've got to understand the dynamic

56
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,070
of New England politics

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,380
New Englanders tend to vote for the

58
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,240
incumbent Bernie Sanders is not an

59
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,460
incumbent presidential figure he's a

60
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,439
Challenger for the presidency he's not

61
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,480
even the nominee of the Democratic Party

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,709
he barely cracked 50% in his home state

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,420
so - so

64
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,250
night two people's home states were up

65
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,570
Elizabeth Warren came in third in hers

66
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,060
she should drop out and Bernie Sanders

67
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,519
barely managed to crack 50 in a state

68
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,590
where supposedly he was ahead by 50

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,410
points supposedly he was running in the

70
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,860
70s a week ago or a couple of weeks ago

71
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,320
where's your support go Bernie Joe Biden

72
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,750
won two states tonight by a bigger

73
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,030
margin than Sanders won his own fucking

74
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,380
home state he hears Sanders strength he

75
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,960
wins Vermont by 51 percent but let's see

76
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,000
Joe Biden won Alabama with 63 percent

77
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,180
that's I think that's a bigger number Oh

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,370
anyone Virginia with 53 Virginia one of

79
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,200
the most important swing states of the

80
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,150
whole United States at this point

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,130
probably you know the mean median and

82
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,650
the mode as far as that goes other than

83
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,540
maybe Florida Joe Biden knocks it out of

84
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,160
the park gets over 50 I think by the way

85
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,540
when a candidate does that doesn't it

86
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,030
robbed everyone else of Delegates I

87
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,510
think it does Bernie Sanders only got

88
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,490
that in Vermont and just barely dude but

89
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,549
Bernie Sanders at this point is not

90
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,200
looking too strong now Jake jigger of

91
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,610
The Young Turks network of course does

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,899
his live stream I would have but you

93
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,210
know I'm in Amsterdam I'm I'm

94
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,430
handicapped by six hours when it comes

95
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,980
to US political discourse at the moment

96
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,570
come come you know months from now or

97
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,239
something maybe that changes right now I

98
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,280
can't really livestream things that are

99
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,450
gonna be at 3:00 a.m. I don't think that

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,340
you would enjoy it I don't think it's

101
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,640
gonna be quite as energetic you'd have

102
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,920
to get me loaded first maybe Jake

103
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,390
Jagger's doing is his live analysis and

104
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,670
I saw a clip this morning because like

105
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,589
five people who sent it to me he had a

106
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,690
meltdown and abandoned his own show

107
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,120
because Bernie Sanders was doing so

108
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,800
poorly but yeah I think I mean the news

109
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,170
of the night is this I'm gonna go

110
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,040
through the states here's a list of

111
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,410
where Bernie won California by 33 which

112
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,359
you know that was pretty much expected

113
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,560
that could rise or fall is only 65

114
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:14,460
percent reporting Colorado with 36 Utah

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,649
with 35 and Vermont with 51 that last

116
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,170
one really must hurt him by the way he

117
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,608
might win Maine there's 81% reporting

118
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,500
there and it hasn't been declared yet

119
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,090
because Biden is only leading by a point

120
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,800
so this could go either way it could be

121
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,780
a fifth state for Bernie or a night stay

122
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,639
for Biden

123
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,979
but I mean this is hilarious oh here's

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,580
where Joe Biden won he wins Alabama with

125
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:40,240
63 Arkansas with 41 Massachusetts with

126
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:44,318
34 Minnesota with 39 North Carolina with

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:48,129
43 Oklahoma with 39 Tennessee with 42

128
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,680
Texas with 34 in Virginia with 53 now

129
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:52,500
what does this tell us it tells us that

130
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,849
the Democratic voters have rejected

131
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,009
socialism they have rejected Bernie

132
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:00,610
Sanders snake oil which I'll give you

133
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,979
lukewarm golfclap their Biden I think

134
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,259
still ends up losing but he probably

135
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,508
doesn't get crippled the same way and

136
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,000
this gives us so many advantages seeing

137
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:11,979
Biden you know devolve on a debate stage

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,110
talking to Trump will be funny

139
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,210
number one Trump will almost certainly

140
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,680
win number two although I'd be more

141
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,599
certain if Bernie Sanders were the

142
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,779
nominee and the Democrats don't go full

143
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,710
dumbass they don't go full socialist

144
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,569
socialism should never be allowed to

145
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,830
represent a mainstream political force

146
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,990
within the United States it's a failed

147
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,849
system we've watched it fail over and

148
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,979
over again and the kind of programs that

149
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,628
Bernie Sanders is arguing for have more

150
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,639
in common with Venezuela than they do

151
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:39,250
with ma Nordic model he doesn't even

152
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,440
follow that Bernie Sanders is not a

153
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,449
social democrat he is a socialist

154
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,610
he's been proclaiming himself won since

155
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,919
the 1970s I'm tired of Bernie Sanders

156
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,089
fans lying and trying to Gaslight me on

157
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,710
this you're not gonna be able to get

158
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:53,589
around me of all people it's just not

159
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,719
gonna fucking happen anyway Bernie

160
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:58,089
Sanders has been crippled he's not out

161
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,680
of the running I think that that most

162
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:02,199
what this probably leads to is a

163
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,849
contested convention this is another

164
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,560
reason to believe Trump will win I mean

165
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:07,330
his odds must be rising right now

166
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,620
because it looks like his opponents

167
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,000
gonna be a dude with dementia who

168
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,710
doesn't even technically have a clear

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,930
mandate going into the nomination

170
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,430
process if they go there and they have a

171
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,960
contested convention here's what I

172
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,789
imagine will happen Biden will be ahead

173
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,378
he will have a clear majority but he

174
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:22,449
will be ahead in the delegate count

175
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,699
he will clearly be the one that's going

176
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,379
to be nominated but the Bernie Sanders

177
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,360
fans will raise the biggest godalmighty

178
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,270
stink ever in fact some of Bernie

179
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,500
Sanders own staffers have talked about

180
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,448
committing arson and assault if that

181
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,849
happens if Bernie Sanders is not

182
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,099
nominated and I suspect he won't be this

183
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,800
considerably reduces his odds if we went

184
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,900
into the suit

185
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,909
into Super Tuesday saying Sanders is

186
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,359
technically frontrunner albeit a weak

187
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,610
one

188
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,580
Biden's gotten that back this gives him

189
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,199
quite an edge in the delegate total it's

190
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,419
not insurmountable but you have to

191
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,780
understand the other effect the other

192
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:59,180
effect here is that if he looks like

193
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,250
he's inevitable Warren will probably

194
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,449
drop out and endorse Joe Biden at that

195
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,430
point he will coast through the

196
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,990
remaining states Bernie Sanders will

197
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,580
still continue to pick up minority

198
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,430
delegates maybe even win a couple of

199
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,490
states probably just enough to keep Joe

200
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,169
Biden from a clear majority by the way

201
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,550
but Biden will get it and then the

202
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,150
Bernie Sanders fans who have been

203
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,770
promised free everything will say oh no

204
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,870
imagine that your promised imagine that

205
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,090
you're crazy relative promises to get

206
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,310
you all sorts of shit at Christmas I'm

207
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,739
gonna give you a sports car and a trend

208
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,120
a house and I'm gonna give you half a

209
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,830
million dollars you do this like a

210
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,719
little kid or something the mentality

211
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,340
will be similar you promised them all

212
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,990
sorts of stuff that you can't really

213
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,099
deliver on but you're promising it to

214
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,659
them to make them happy and then

215
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,370
Christmas comes and then they don't have

216
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,960
any of these things because somebody

217
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,419
else informs them that they couldn't

218
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,340
have them now ultimately it's because

219
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,440
crazy relative couldn't deliver on those

220
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,210
things and everyone around you is

221
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,699
rejecting that premise they know that

222
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,888
he's crazy but unfortunately you

223
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,900
believed it because you know it's just

224
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,729
not quite mentally there the Bernie

225
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,859
Sanders fans right now are having a

226
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,359
nervous breakdown and and partially

227
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,460
that's deserved some of these people

228
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
should fucking know better they've been

229
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,539
taken in by a bunch of economic

230
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,520
Scientology and they need to be informed

231
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:16,878
of what reality really is that is free

232
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,620
shit does not work saying it sounds it

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,569
sounds noise that we should give people

234
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,190
free ice cream okay how are you gonna

235
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,259
pay for that all make the billionaires

236
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,080
give you ice cream that's that's fucking

237
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,879
stupid that's not the way it works it's

238
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,770
not the way an economy works it's not

239
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,409
the way sanity works it's not the way

240
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,208
the US apparently has chosen to work if

241
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,490
Bernie Sanders can't even scrape

242
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:39,380
together a clear consensus among dem

243
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,000
motors this just proves what I've been

244
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,549
saying for months which is that he's

245
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,100
taken the Overton Window of the Dems and

246
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,349
shifted it way off to the side leaving

247
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,930
behind all of the centrist voters in the

248
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,329
fucking country ever Chua Lee every

249
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,670
independent when people see this now

250
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:57,589
Joe Biden just got his are of

251
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,809
inevitability back there are a lot of

252
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,399
people by the way who will vote for Joe

253
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:03,559
and hold their nose who aren't really

254
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,989
excited you've got two shitty

255
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,249
possibilities here and you have for

256
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:08,509
quite some time because none of these

257
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:10,910
other fruitcakes had been viable

258
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:12,319
Bloomberg's come in third in a handful

259
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,969
of states you might even pick up a few

260
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,738
delegates but he doesn't matter

261
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,299
he's even admitted the other day he

262
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:19,939
admitted no there's no path forward for

263
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:21,860
me to be nominated yeah I mean why are

264
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,540
you in then dude he's more likely to

265
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,309
drop out and run as an independent at

266
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,129
this point which by the way would kill

267
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:30,649
the Democrats as a party you got Bernie

268
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:33,259
Sanders who can't win because he's too

269
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,389
old he's too weak and feeble he's just

270
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,959
had got done having a major heart attack

271
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:41,029
he is a self-proclaimed socialist it

272
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,309
doesn't matter if the Twitter mafia

273
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:45,709
finds that to be fine it doesn't matter

274
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:47,959
if tumblr pages agree that that's okay

275
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:50,059
it doesn't matter how many shit posts I

276
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,799
have to see plastered all over the

277
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:53,988
internet about how socialism isn't

278
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,549
really the problem it was CIA coos or

279
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:57,709
it's really capitalism that killed

280
00:09:55,549 --> 00:10:00,470
Venezuela and all of this stupid shit

281
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:01,910
doesn't work the other alternative is a

282
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,499
dude who's almost as always like two

283
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,499
years younger and he's got dementia

284
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:08,389
clearly has dementia Joe Biden could

285
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:10,970
string together a paragraph without

286
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:13,519
constantly making mistakes 10 years ago

287
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,220
now I know that he suffers with a verbal

288
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
tic a stutter I understand that but some

289
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,019
of the things that he has a problem with

290
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,209
lately are not stuttering him him

291
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,459
forgetting the most basic things like

292
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,679
what state he's in or to where his pants

293
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,910
maybe before the staffers run after him

294
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,449
to keep him from going outside

295
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,639
that's not normal dude your candidate I

296
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:37,219
think about who you're running who your

297
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,869
candidates going to be Democrats think

298
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,119
about the choice that it has boiled down

299
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:43,220
to you pissed away all the viable ones

300
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:46,220
nobody ever took Gillibrand seriously

301
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,540
who lien Castro sabotage himself and

302
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,249
then he had bootie judge who was

303
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,389
probably the last sane person in the

304
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,790
field and I used that term very

305
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:55,129
tenuously he decided to drop out he

306
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:59,629
endorsed by Dhin much to Biden's a

307
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:01,640
parent benefit tonight so yeah Super

308
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:03,290
Tuesday round up again

309
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,630
Elizabeth Warren fails to win her home

310
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,240
say comes at third is humiliated which

311
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,740
is what was going to happen it was clear

312
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,230
that if she won it would be by a slim

313
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,300
margin her most likely opportunity was

314
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,820
to come in a close second behind Sanders

315
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,410
ends up inverting completely Biden

316
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,270
manages to fucking grab the state

317
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,430
partially because she refused to drop

318
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,050
out if she had I have no doubt if she

319
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,250
had dropped out whether she endorsed

320
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,079
Bernie or not he would have grabbed

321
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,120
Massachusetts if you look at these

322
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,940
numbers Biden would have been pulling

323
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,840
5050 anyway even if she did and that's

324
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,670
the funny part

325
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,260
Biden's in such a commanding position

326
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,510
right now that he probably would have

327
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,100
grabbed up almost this he probably would

328
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,720
have gotten five or six states even if

329
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,300
Warren had dropped down endorsed Bernie

330
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,060
Sanders the day before that's the funny

331
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,699
part barely would have counterbalanced

332
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,869
bootie judge of course she's been a

333
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,820
non-existent fixture of the field for a

334
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,710
long time she's at this point she's

335
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,960
broken down into pandering identity

336
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,060
politics and making tweets begging for

337
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,410
money well if she keeps making those

338
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,000
tweets and it's clear she's not gonna

339
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,439
drop out then I don't know what to I

340
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,120
don't know what to tell her fans but at

341
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,550
that point you've really chosen a real

342
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,040
goddamn smelly dead fish as a candidate

343
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,630
because if a person is completely

344
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,160
crushed in this fashion and doesn't

345
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,930
leave the race they're just being

346
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,339
stubborn or trying to grift off money

347
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,349
which which is what she's been doing the

348
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,300
whole time Elizabeth Warren loves money

349
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,070
she took tens of millions in corporate

350
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,660
money and their Senate bid never spent

351
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,360
it and then rolled it over and called

352
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,150
herself grassroots Bloomberg's out of it

353
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,160
he comes in 30 doesn't show up it dude

354
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,840
the top number one and two people in

355
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,270
every single state here is Biden and

356
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,710
Sanders nobody else cracked into the top

357
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,920
three anywhere and for the most part

358
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,420
didn't grab up any delegates at all I

359
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,040
think that this is great I think it's

360
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,199
good for America too it's good to give a

361
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,810
stinging rebuke to the socialist whining

362
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,760
babies number one Elizabeth Warren

363
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,410
fundamentally knocked out number two I

364
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,569
think that's good for the country she is

365
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,000
she's an ignominious old fool

366
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,320
Bloomberg doesn't gain any traction it's

367
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,660
clear that he's not gonna do anything

368
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,940
other than sow chaos possibly and that

369
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,219
would be funny more than anything Biden

370
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,710
will probably be the nominee Sanders has

371
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,530
been rebuked his fans are salty Warren's

372
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:11,660
fans are salty everyone else is salty

373
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,760
Trump must be celebrating is he's

374
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,410
complaining right now the end it's

375
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,000
reverse psychology when he make

376
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,949
tweets about them stealing things from

377
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,870
Bernie Sanders he's trying to get the

378
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:23,389
Bernie Sanders fans riled up more and it

379
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,800
works that's why he keeps doing it I'm

380
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,629
gonna have a good day it's gonna be

381
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:32,560
pretty fun corona virus epidemic

382
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:32,560
spreading a sigh that's about all he so
