00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,790
someone comes to you for help

51
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,549
how to help them better their home

52
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,410
situation because when it comes down to

53
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,060
it we all want to do something for

54
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,280
information security if we can't take

55
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,050
care of what's at home then there's

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,750
really no need to travel somewhere and

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,880
watch somebody else's network security

58
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,760
Center living out of the hotel room

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,319
that's just doesn't make any sense a

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,739
couple of quick resources there's go ask

61
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:42,399
Rose comm from safe escape gorg go ask

62
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:44,650
Rose is a parent of safe escape sorry

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,330
vice versa it's a resource center for

64
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,190
people looking to get out of domestic

65
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,080
abuse situations founded by Christopher

66
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,840
Cox if you want to volunteer with a

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,430
group help at safest gate org is the way

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,069
to either volunteer to help with a group

69
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,019
or to seek help yourself so if you're

70
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,720
flying back and someone says oh you went

71
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,060
to a conference what did you learn I'm

72
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,010
an information security oh I'll get this

73
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,660
situation there's your one shot you can

74
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,530
tell them to go to these two resources

75
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,090
and begin the process of getting help

76
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,769
another great resource is the smart

77
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,980
girls guide to privacy it's a little bit

78
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:20,650
longer read than a website but just some

79
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,798
quick triage if you don't have time to

80
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,120
delve further so this talk is kind of

81
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,000
built on the information security

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,670
principles of data confidentiality data

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,850
availability and data excuse me data

84
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,518
integrity from those we take the same

85
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:39,880
CIA triad but we make it control the

86
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,370
environment identity theft and data

87
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,900
availability and out of those three the

88
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,970
most important is to control your

89
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,489
environment it doesn't matter that you

90
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,440
preserve the data the black box and the

91
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,329
Tesla's intact but we lost all the

92
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,069
occupants to the car you have to make

93
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,090
sure the person asking for help is

94
00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:00,429
physically safe and by controlling the

95
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,889
environment there's personal security

96
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:07,019
data security and family disclosures it

97
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,019
doesn't matter how strong excuse me

98
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,019
these are the these are the equivalent

99
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,989
four cans of coke in one can these are

100
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:20,579
amazing it's personal security data

101
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,578
security and family disclosures

102
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,190
so personal security if somebody's

103
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,620
physically abusing you in the situation

104
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,420
you'll want to get off the X data

105
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,910
security you know change your password

106
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,040
slot any devices but those first two

107
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:38,480
don't matter if for Bailey disclosures

108
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:43,010
like we've seen with NATO Special Forces

109
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,380
hobb somebody showed my son's being

110
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,140
deployed - thank you sir

111
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,990
my son's being deployed to the war zone

112
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,150
in Syria but don't tell anybody it's a

113
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:58,370
secret that's on Facebook that doesn't

114
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,810
really work as a secret so in here who's

115
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,550
heard of getting off the eggs does that

116
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:07,040
familiar concept hands yes no a couple

117
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,360
that means immediately getting out of a

118
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,790
bad situation it means you're on the

119
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,880
crosshairs for a target we have a

120
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:16,760
meeting a few years back well the case

121
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,890
officers had a meeting overseas it went

122
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,810
south afterwards the chief of station

123
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:23,900
has together to debrief to figure out

124
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,310
what happened and the case officer just

125
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,960
stuck around to see if things would get

126
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,520
better

127
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,590
station chief said these words no bad

128
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,880
situation ever got better by sticking

129
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,440
around same thing applies here Jim at

130
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,940
revolutionary security said the same

131
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
thing you never have to ask permission

132
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,910
to leave a dangerous situation if you

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,320
know it's a bad situation your person

134
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,940
your friend whoever is being physically

135
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,620
abused mentally abused verbally abused

136
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,270
you don't have to wait for someone to

137
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,710
say you know it's okay for you lady you

138
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,919
can leave on your own and deal two

139
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,109
repercussions later so for getting off

140
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,719
the eggs have a bug-out bag packed show

141
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,520
hands you might know that term hurricane

142
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,620
bag down here in Florida what's that

143
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,940
go bag yeah so you want to have your

144
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,169
important stuff in there your personal

145
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,310
let's have the important stuff whether

146
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,659
it's a birth certificate driver's

147
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,840
license passport credit cards if you can

148
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,310
laptops

149
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,260
everything key that you need if you need

150
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,810
to leave in a moment's notice have it

151
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,390
with you and ready to go some of the

152
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,370
people for operations safe escape some

153
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,960
of the victims have been the

154
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,300
veterinarian tanks and they've kept

155
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,609
their critical documents at the vet lab

156
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,700
inside the safe because it's one thing

157
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,680
if the ex soon-to-be

158
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,030
takes the document out of the dresser

159
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,950
it's another thing to break into the

160
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,359
vent lab and break into the medicine

161
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:46,520
cabinet the police are gonna respond to

162
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:50,030
that just a little bit differently you

163
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,960
know we talked about what if thank you

164
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,400
[Music]

165
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,159
what if they leave okay

166
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,609
what if they leave the premises there's

167
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,680
a couple of things to do and first thing

168
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:09,110
you want to do the abusers left the

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,370
situation wow that's a great typo I'm

170
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,080
glad I stayed in my room all afternoon

171
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,960
and walked in my slides uh-huh you want

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,219
to change your passwords you want to

173
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,020
change your locks and your codes you

174
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,900
wanna have a locksmith come over you

175
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,030
want to change the garage door frequency

176
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,789
a lot of people when the ex leaves the

177
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,260
garage door buzzer still is gonna let

178
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,940
them in if you leave the door open to

179
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,170
the house they've still got access to

180
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:35,810
the house so recommend this in triage

181
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,580
order call the landlord call a locksmith

182
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,410
getting lots changed change your garage

183
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,630
door and then start to work on your pass

184
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,420
codes as they come over some of the

185
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,159
garage door codes we've heard about on

186
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,930
the bottom flap when you open it says if

187
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,380
you forgotten your garage door passcode

188
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:56,570
here's how to bypass it that's not a

189
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:58,100
lock that's just a glorified key during

190
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,909
this process you want to be persistent

191
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,550
and thorough

192
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:20,570
changing the passwords changing your

193
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:22,700
website access we all know what happened

194
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:27,280
after that because Anakin didn't change

195
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:29,240
his codes so on a known safe machine

196
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,130
because we want to assume there might be

197
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,950
stalker where you want to change your

198
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,559
passwords and security questions right

199
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,120
standard practice

200
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,619
he might know we're a little bit short

201
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,600
on time that's usually our talk but

202
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,710
what's a known safe machine where to go

203
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,710
for an unclean machine

204
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:52,010
family friends library Apple Store just

205
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,510
not the machine that's in the house just

206
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,770
not the device you have your physical

207
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,090
hands on but when you're doing this this

208
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,880
is why the key points for the colleague

209
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,830
it's okay to lie online there's somebody

210
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,220
in the crowd it drives our crazy when I

211
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,720
give my name is Paul or Mike I just

212
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,400
don't like using my true name for

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,290
anything in public setting over in

214
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,730
Starbucks just because so where did your

215
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,980
parents get married if I can go to

216
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,560
genealogy com that's not password reset

217
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,800
question where your parents get married

218
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,930
Tatooine information where did you go to

219
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,189
highschool

220
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,319
ridgemont high it doesn't have to be the

221
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,920
truth are just looking for an answer to

222
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,850
the question events of where did you

223
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,439
meet your girlfriend farmersonly.com it

224
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,360
doesn't matter what it is it just

225
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,830
doesn't have to be the truth it's an

226
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,790
answer to the question that you'll know

227
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:56,810
and somebody else wouldn't know so back

228
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:59,089
to our scenario you do what's that but

229
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:04,640
what if they're a Clemson fan and that's

230
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:05,750
an accurate statement so while the HELOC

231
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,250
Smith is coming over while the

232
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,500
landlord's coming over to reset the

233
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,090
passwords the pass codes to your house

234
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,610
the keys whether it's a smart card

235
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,770
whatnot you change your router and you

236
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,330
look down here and you can see you know

237
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,160
obviously there's nothing connected to

238
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,280
the ethernet you can see the wireless

239
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,250
devices the galaxy s 8 and then you can

240
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,459
see it's a PC and it's a Mac well the PC

241
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,080
is actually my iPhone I don't have it

242
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,400
named to my true name iPhone just

243
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,010
because I'll need to have that connected

244
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,260
the SSID to make it easier for somebody

245
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,210
to find out what devices is for Marin

246
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,939
middle attack Singh here you don't have

247
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:44,720
to name your device your true name so

248
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,850
right here this is the right frame for

249
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,650

250
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,470
device there's nothing unusual

251
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,209
another thing to do go to the router

252
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,550

254
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,240
what devices have been in the residence

268
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,350
as a blue force tracker you can see

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,720
everywhere I'm going with my phone you

270

272

setting is turned off for personal

292
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,420
digital protection a very quick story

293
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,510
there's a woman who had a five year been

294
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,979
divorced five years her ex had enabled

295
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,810
these settings and he's able to see

296
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,580
everywhere she was going for five solid

297
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,219
years anytime she went out for drinks

298
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,600
with friends she got papers from an

299
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,279
attorney saying here at alcoholic

300
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,300

301
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,550
the friends and let the kids at the

302
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,229
babysitter all because he was able to

303
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,390
eavesdrop on these couple of radio

304
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:49,980
settings also a couple features

305
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:52,050
sarcastically sent from the iPhone go to

306
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,510
messages text message forwarding and you

307
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,459
can forward the text messages to your

308
00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:00,209
iOS device I have my text set up to go

309
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,959
to my laptops one victim had this set

310
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,239
where

311
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,850
these text messages that you're getting

312
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,779
SMS and the iMessage we're being sent to

313
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,940
her ex-husband's iPad laptop and iPhone

314
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,770
screenshot and they'll into a train to a

315
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,440
law enforcement let them deal with it

316
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:20,250
it's not hacking it's just changing a

317
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,680
radio button same thing for Android you

318
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,540
go to recently use devices and look down

319
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,939
here and you can see that the one device

320
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,829
is now being mirrored on four other

321
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,070
accounts so again take a screenshot

322
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,680
preserve that for evidence for later and

323
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,570
then only have the device present where

324
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,000
you need the person be just single sign

325
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,380
if you will you know this probably makes

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,750
a lot of sense oh yeah I should have

327
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,070
thought of that but all its low-hanging

328
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,720
fruit when you put it together it gives

329
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,339
you a lot of information about the

330
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,950
person who's trying to get free from the

331
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:54,990

333
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,649
takeout records everything you've ever

334
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,290
done with your Google account since you

335
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:04,170
created all your deleted emails deleted

336
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,849

location history wireless devices

339
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,430
connected payment history a full bevy of

340
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,869
data file your login to Gmail is here

341
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:20,130
and once that data is pulled down by the

342
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:21,779
adversary you don't get it back one good

343
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,810
thing though from an insider threat case

344
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:27,660
we just wrapped up if a text messages

345
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,810
deleted in Google Hangouts that's not

346
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,130
available in Google takeout recovery

347
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,290
conversely if it's corporate and they

348
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:38,339
pay Google enough that text message is

349
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,870
there unless you pay Google to retain it

350
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,640
longer than a certain period minutes

351
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,829
till you begin basically if your ping

352
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:48,060
Google question is still going to be

353
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:50,449
there Facebook everyone leaves Facebook

354
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,449
right you go to your Facebook settings

355
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:56,040
account set up security active sessions

356
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,740
and you can see everywhere that your

357
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,180
Facebook is still logged into for users

358
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,890
security and privacy it doesn't matter

359
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,410
how secure your password is if you're

360
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:07,050
still present online

361
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:10,199
we had one young soldier who's it

362
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,609
specializing in cyber we gave him a

363
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,258
break he went back to his barracks and

364
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:17,279
found that when he had gone vacation to

365
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:19,560
Europe he logged into the group face a

366
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,800
group machine at a hostel two years ago

367
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:30,750
he was still actively logged in in 2019

368
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:33,089
when he is there in 2017 reason this is

369
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,250
so absolutely important your Facebook

370
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,920
called data records are going to retain

371
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:43,259
when you have messenger it's going to

372
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,719
retain not just the SMS AT&T t-mobile a

373
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,149
couple of providers retained three days

374
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,279
worth of information of the text

375
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:53,670
messages themselves a TTL retains a to

376
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:55,920
be sent messages Facebook recovers and

377
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,860
stores the full granular text message

378
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,740
between the two so whether it's divorce

379
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,180
case stalking whatnot if they have

380
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,740
access to your Facebook can they can get

381
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,628
this file they've got the entire

382
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:11,009
granular text just as if they'd imaged

383
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:14,130

persistent and thorough about this this

399
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,000
is a USB Drive that was given to me by a

400
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,980
PI a couple years ago this text message

401
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,689
is about making sure you delete your

402
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,759
text these are deleted texts were

403
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:59,579
covered with a forensic tool put on a

404
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,800
USB Drive they deleted the deleted text

405
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:03,388
about the deleted texts before they gave

406
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,869
me the drive I were covered it with disk

407
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:08,880
drill because it wasn't like you're

408
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:11,188
still able to recover data with freeware

409
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,870
off the internet so if you're going to

410
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,089
leave an abusive situation take your

411

data with you if they leave it behind

412
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,668
this grill and other tools make

413
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,999
very easy to recover if you need to

414
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:23,799

423
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:46,480

429
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,629
to consider all this low hanging fruit

430
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,049

new cycle of life is the best solution

439
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,909
is not to post anything on Facebook

440
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,860
Twitter and just be silent on social

441

other sources as to where you are it

450

you know when you okay couple when you

456
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,269
see employees badge in and out you know

457
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,820
that's controlled access data only a few

458
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:20,259
people I have access to it but to give

459
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,559
somebody similar access on the home

460
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,610
front

461
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,440
all you have to do is add someone's

462
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,799
email account to the ring doorbell

463
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,299
before you leave the premises and now

464
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,070
they've still got access to the front

465
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,360
door and not just like corporate they

466
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,820
can watch and see how often you came

467
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,820
into the door they have full access to

468
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,320
1080p audio video recording of all the

469
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,899
conversations that took place around the

470
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,399
door down here in the south we don't

471
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:44,080
just say goodbye we talk for another

472
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:46,059
twenty to thirty minutes at the front

473
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,100
door that's something the ex is going to

474
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,299
have access to so it's the same concept

475
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,480
that's what you deal with on the

476
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,950
corporate side it's just the domestic

477
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,330
side if you need to scrub the access

478
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,159
control list from your ring doorbell

479
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,539
does the X have access to this let's

480
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,929
take them off and change the password

481
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:04,029
the same for Alexa Amazon Alexa records

482
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:06,340
every conversation if it says hey Alexa

483
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,620
or something that sounds like Alexa if

484
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,149
you say I talked to Alex it's going to

485
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,489
record that conversation because she

486
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:15,399
might have said Alexa and these

487
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:18,159
histories are history historical

488
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,789
recordings are still online and if they

489
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,499
have the

490
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:23,169
access to this they can go back and

491
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:25,389
listen to it and not only that they have

492
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:27,369
access to your smart home devices tree

493
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:29,218
they can go and turn off your burglar

494
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:32,259
alarm cut off the smoke detector

495
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:33,789
beckylyn CSI cyber came out in 2012 we

496
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:35,709
laughed about how ridiculous of a

497
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:38,109
concept that was and now this is

498
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:40,690
something that your son can bring home

499
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:42,549
an Amazon echo dot connected to your

500
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,959
network and someone has access to do

501
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:46,209
these types of malicious sex to your

502
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:48,699
home security system for convenience

503
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:50,589
so again just scrub the access control

504
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:53,889
list but be aware these are things you

505
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:56,649
need to look at another one I'm a boring

506
00:20:53,889 --> 00:21:00,579
but a Certified Fraud examiner there's a

507
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:02,738
thing called implied trust and if you

508
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:04,869
have a joint Amazon account but don't

509
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:07,690
take them off they keep charging your

510
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:10,769
credit card attorneys and banks they

511
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,849
broke you up it was assumed do you

512
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,129
approve this because you didn't stop

513
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:18,339
their access so they can run your credit

514
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:20,799
card up maxed out your credit card and

515
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:22,928
your soul because you didn't remove them

516
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,509
so you have to make sure you scrub all

517
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,249
the ACLS or help the person who's come

518
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:29,139
to you scrub the ACLS on this because

519
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:32,679
the liability that your personal would

520
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:35,319
be left with moving out of Sprint's

521
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:38,499
pools only check the time here because

522
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:41,399
they want to kick us out hard at four on

523
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:43,809
the principles on the window side

524
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:45,819
history you can see all the metadata for

525
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:47,589
all the names of the files printed so

526
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:48,369
even though I'll have access to the

527
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,678
corporate network

528
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:54,728
I can see plants and tents and metadata

529
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,889
of what that unit is going to do another

530
00:21:54,729 --> 00:22:00,249
client site for the principles I just

531
00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:03,099
walked over hit reprint and it reprint

532
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:04,749
the entire ring five hundred pages plus

533
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:07,509
if everything had ever been put on that

534
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:10,089
classified printer I was in third flat I

535
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:11,589
walked there were no crap and just watch

536
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:14,139
it print out I'm the security officer

537
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:16,389
told him what I did but the lesson was I

538
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:19,059
wasn't cleared for their facility I was

539
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:20,678
cleared to speak just like here but

540
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,389
they're equally as vulnerable because

541
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,999
just like your person you're trying to

542
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:26,079
help for domestic abuse situation if you

543
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,609
don't take the printer with you

544
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,399
everything you've done your new

545
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:31,749
apartment and bank account new job he

546
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,709
could be vulnerable just by hitting

547
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:34,090
reprinted

548
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,590
as a matter what your password is if the

549
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:41,230
copies of your old documents are still

550
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:44,049
there I'm fun at parties on the window

551
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:46,450
side if you go to smoke cups with in

552
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:48,700
terminal it shows all the print jobs

553
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,529
someone should see will only retain the

554
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,330
metadata the ones with D does anybody

555
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:58,960
know what these files that start dr ever

556
00:22:52,330 --> 00:23:01,510
prize if you do yes what's that what's

557
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:06,250
that yeah the one that starts at D what

558
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:09,789
is that why is that different it's a PDF

559
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,500
I can actually drag it rotten that PDF I

560
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:13,960
can move that PDF to my desktop and

561
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,169
reopen that file whereas the other ones

562
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,529
I just give the metadata somebody friend

563
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:23,230
a world market coupon as someone in this

564
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:25,240
room said a coupon for 25% off only

565
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,130
means I'm spending 75% more than I

566
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,059
wanted to spend originally you're just

567
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:33,460
your marketing to me but that D file

568
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,840
that's an actual PDF outlets a financial

569
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,640
follow that somebody could recover from

570
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,500
the Mac principal at solar it's a great

571
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,690
for insider threat it's great for fraud

572
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,630
examination but for the domestic abuse

573
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:47,049
flood that's a vector that some people

574
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:50,820
aren't aware exist it's gonna get a

575
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:54,429
little bit creepy here but superhuman

576
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:57,158
you might heard this great plugin for

577
00:23:54,429 --> 00:24:00,190
$30 a month you can have your corporate

578
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,440
email tied to marketing and you can see

579
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,710
exactly how many times some open they

580
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,080
have a meta pixel 1x1 pixel embedded you

581
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,270
can see the the general GPS location of

582
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,678
where they open email how many times

583
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,350
they open the email what time they open

584
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,419
the email

585
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,889
so for $30 a month if your ex starts

586
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:20,080
emailing you things about the divorce

587
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,529
situation or your persons divorce

588
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,899
situation they're able to see exactly

589
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,299
where your when you open it a VPN does

590
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:31,719
defeat this not letting remote images to

591
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:33,639
does defeat this Gmail now offers the

592
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,320
same feature of course for a fee but

593
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,440
Gina offers the same stalking feature

594
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,168
and we add that with Doctson for Outlook

595
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,570
you can see exactly how long they open

596
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,970
up what page they read what sections

597
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,379
they skimmed over I can understand

598
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,230
Corporate America having this for

599
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,680
network security though 365 on the home

600
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,930
front

601
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,420
take if somebody's a technical user and

602
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,190
they're doing this to the X they can now

603
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,500
see exactly pretty open the email how

604
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,770
long they're at the document it's a very

605
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:08,080
simple risk mitigation use paper using

606
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:09,730
print it out simple the defeat for this

607
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,629
you go back to terminal I tried to get a

608
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:16,000
video but presentations and video right

609
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:18,850
the trouble in Mac type an MDL s made of

610
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,890
data list drag-and-drop to that PDF of

611
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,629
question in there and the beacon down

612
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:26,190
the bottom is going to be very apparent

613
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:28,690
that this is a beacon going back to

614
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,850
wherever the beacon came from that you

615
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,890
have tracking software in there so far

616
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:37,689
we haven't found a way to mitigate this

617
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:40,060
on Windows yet post office offers

618
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:43,270
something equally as impressive usually

619
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:45,879
it's fine man in the middle you can sign

620
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,280
up to get PDFs JPEGs of all the mail

621
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,470
coming into your residence but if you

622
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,970
know the abusers leaving the situation

623
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,400
they can sign up for this

624
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,500
get PDFs JPEGs have all mail coming in

625
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,720
roof checks removes legal documents from

626
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,760
the mailbox and the victim never is

627
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,670
aware that the key documents were

628
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,980
removed to talk to the Postmaster

629
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,920
General of Fort Mill South Carolina yeah

630
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,780
it's impressive and the two ways to

631
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,400
mitigate this are either to a subform in

632
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,810
the middle yourself and find out that

633
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,270
someone's already signed up for you or

634
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:17,770
to go to the post office in person to

635
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,680
find out if this is on there and have it

636
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:23,470
removed so this is equally as damaging

637
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,020
as having a network stiffer but on the

638
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,970
real world side a couple other things

639
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,639
for Aikau google counters so when you

640
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,950
decided for corporate mail like without

641
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,080
tripping with concur you can have your

642
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,850
girlfriend your wife your girlfriend and

643
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,520
your wife and your boss all get copies

644
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:42,879
of your itinerary well if something goes

645
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,230
south they still had your itinerary your

646
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,030
confirmation number your seat number

647
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,590
they could call they could they know

648
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:50,139
your house is empty no kids are home

649
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:54,939
alone all because again you don't scrub

650
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:56,860
the ACL for your calendar list this will

651
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,580
go I pass through the point to this yes

652
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,110
you can spoof your Twitter GPS

653
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,889
okay so I tweet from I'm from Belarus

654
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:07,169
from Hawaii I'm from Saudi Arabia I

655
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:10,800
didn't actually go there in 3 minutes 30

656
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:12,810
seconds to each other but drunk did he

657
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,030
and Foley calm I can put on my Twitter

658
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,169
report I was in class over in Belgium I

659
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,320
was teaching screwing around the

660
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:21,870
internet same thing and I was able to

661
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,389
tweet from Moscow darussalam I'm

662
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,699
obviously not really there from the back

663
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,240
of the classroom but what is there

664
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,920
what's real is it's going to tell you

665
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,110
that I'm tweeting for my iPhone that

666
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,780
gives you an attack vector we know we

667
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,689
want to go into after wills iPhone I

668
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:42,030
account through this manner or try to

669
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,640
hack into his Android and that

670
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:47,129
differentiates exactly what device your

671
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,170
victim is using and you want them to

672
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:54,360
maybe not use Twitter during this time

673
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:56,790
of domestic for confrontation the Grug

674
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,179
says you signal you stored those are

675
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,800
great if your device is clean I say

676
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,990
assume all your devices are compromised

677
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:08,750
until you know for sure every keystroke

678
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:12,780
you make isn't being copied to the ex's

679
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:15,150
device knowing what you're typing so I

680
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,830
would recommend if there's a takeaway to

681
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,750
go a little bit bricks and steaks old

682
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,800
school these personal meetings if

683
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,500
somebody thinks are being followed

684
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,540
installed digitally by the abuser use

685
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,580
personal meetings leave the electronics

686
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,110
behind go somewhere secure go sit down

687
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,530
within the Waffle House and have a

688
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,590
meeting

689
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:34,080
don't do it over text you can have

690
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:36,770
nonverbal paroles of your person coming

691
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,510
to you for help is a bad situation

692
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,670
things like we joked about flip

693
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,530
something I'm wearing a Clemson trim my

694
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,140
facebook page that means things are bad

695
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,180
come by and visit me or come by you know

696
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,070
I'll leave with you instead of texting

697
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,870
things out and letting the user know

698
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,490
that things are bad at home your

699
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,350
Facebook picture change and that's the

700
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,150
beacon that you need help these are

701
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,850
things that can be done that are very

702
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,930
non intrusive that help somebody out of

703
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:04,500
a bad situation

704
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,990
it talks a little about about I thought

705
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,490
it's being monitored in a hat I take a

706
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,260
little bit of a fence that because it's

707
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,510
not really asking a neighbor asked me if

708
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,350
I could help her

709
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:17,600
mother her son's phone while her son's

710
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,699
missing the dead just like dealing with

711
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,070
attorneys it's the short answer in

712
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,480
writing is no the long answer is no I

713
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,310
won't that's illegal

714
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,550
end of story that's not worth in jail

715
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:32,840
over company called in spite their

716
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:34,970
version of hacking a provides BMAC ID to

717
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,850
inspire right you've got my username and

718
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,980
password Evo - a third party the phone

719
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,899
gets backed up nightly him spy just

720
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,120
harvest the deltas between the last time

721
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,380
it was updated takes the changes in the

722
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,090
emails that she reported that's not a

723
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:52,220
hack that's just copying your backup

724
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:55,820
data but again for a prize what's the

725
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,270
easiest way to mitigate this who said

726
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,879
that

727
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:04,610
alright I'm gonna try to throw that for

728
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,850
another one check my time here 15

729
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:12,409
minutes device called sleep cycle anyone

730
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:16,040
here heard of this okay it taps into the

731
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,870
potentiometer on your phone and the over

732
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,129
purpose is to actually track to see how

733
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,409
well you sleep at night you know whether

734
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:23,000
or not you tossed a turn and it gives

735
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,830
your graphic you slept very well from

736
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,660
these hours short light sleep heavy

737
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,129
sleep you're in REM sleep actually

738
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,860
pretty good when you're traveling to see

739
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,900
what's a good mattress for you the Cobra

740
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,310
is for this I would recommend if you

741
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,410
think someone's going through your phone

742
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,320
going through your gear at night

743
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,980
the victim can just load em spy put the

744
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,270
phone down

745
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,350
and then if there was just spike in the

746
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,540
middle of night when they no they didn't

747
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,570
touch it that's your canary to say my

748
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,730
phone has been moved I'm a different

749
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,169
danger awareness situation that was

750
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,360
before or if you just put your phone on

751
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,010
top of your laptop now you know your

752
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,479
phone's moved and now your laptop isn't

753
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:00,860
accessed all through this not alerting

754
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,810
non-intrusive method of using the

755
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:08,959
potentiometer just repurposed another

756
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:12,020
way to have a non-traditional method of

757
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,880
communicating be on your Mac going to

758
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,620
recover mode that partition on your Mac

759
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,280
so recovery to get your Mac out of a bad

760
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,070
situation

761
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,750
control arm reboot it it gives you

762
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,720
access to the internet you can get help

763
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,070
online which is actually kind of ironic

764
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,360
you've got access to a web browser

765
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,799
doesn't retain the history you can go

766
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,110
online and email to different account

767
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:32,240
contact people and that web history

768
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,949
isn't available on the regular petition

769
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,450
if think about it if the recovery

770
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:40,009
tradition gets hosed it's not read-only

771
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,960
that's what for Apple people I feel the

772
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:43,880
Apple Store wait in line this is a

773
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:49,039
pretty bulletproof method to your line

774
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:50,630
without stock or spyware so if you find

775
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,908
a device we've covered the digital

776
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:56,299
domain the social media a little bit of

777
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:57,889
mail but if you find a device electronic

778
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,408
surveillance installations it's not some

779
00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:02,178
more yes I see I use DSN Keaney more

780
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:06,379
providing gadgets these are available

781
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:08,649
from Amazon you have a traditional USB

782
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:11,990
plug but you put a micro SD card in

783
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:15,258
translucent cover now you've got power

784
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,850
and you've got a motion-activated remote

785
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:17,870
camera to see who's coming and going

786
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,360
from your door you know for some

787
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,678
situations this is great is pest control

788
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,469
coming in my house when I'm not there

789
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,259
and going through my stuff that's great

790
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:30,710
for that situation but it's my spouse is

791
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:33,230
stalking me how would I detect this is

792
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,450
actually pretty easy again with the tree

793
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,539
ad right you've got collection power and

794
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:41,769
storage so collection because that USB

795
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:45,980
device doesn't feed out to the internet

796
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:48,080
it's a continuous AC power it has a

797
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,639
maximum range now you know USB card

798
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,918
seating better I saw a two terabyte

799
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:56,658
yes micro USB the other day so

800
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,129
collection of power swords you want to

801
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:59,870
feed off each other the more it collects

802
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:02,658
the more they're going to have to come

803
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:06,439
back and service this this is a can a DP

804
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:08,840
camera hidden inside the clock connects

805
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,389
to AC power next to Wi-Fi and beams out

806
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,309
to the abusers phone so now they're

807
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,600
going to show back on the router you can

808
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:15,799
see where they showed up or you can

809
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,779
actually see where they are on the

810
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,190
router that's illegal you can't

811
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:21,340
videotape somebody in the bedroom you

812
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,879
have an expectation of privacy and that

813
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:27,168
believe is a felony that's a legal term

814
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:29,779
very simple if it's a new camera just

815
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:33,950
unplug it get rid of it who uses desktop

816
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:36,769
clocks anyway that's a seven excuse me

817
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,470
that's a 720p micro camera hidden inside

818
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:40,240
the air freshener

819
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,120
somebody would have to come physically

820
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,060
manage that get the SD card out change

821
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,949
the batteries black device is an

822
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:53,770
audio-only recorder it records 120 hours

823
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:56,260
of audio if you flip the switch up it's

824
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,960
128 non-stop flick it down it's burst

825
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,520
only somebody physically has to manage

826
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,260
that in process or take you know if

827
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,530
anybody's ever processed collection tape

828
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:08,320
for covert collection it's not anything

829
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:11,199
I did it's horrible of having just sit

830
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,510
and listen 220 hours of conversations

831
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,489
you don't care about and type it up but

832
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:19,750
against somebody physically has to

833
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:21,969
manage this so if you don't have access

834
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,500
to the device and you need to manage the

835
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:25,719
SD card you need to manage the power

836
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,280
well if you just give the kids a device

837
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,928
and let them take it to him from the

838
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,090
other parents house every other weekend

839
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:33,220
put it right behind mom and now it's

840
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:35,080
watching mom shorter surfing get all of

841
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,089
her passwords and credentials as she's

842
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,710
online then he goes back to the other

843
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:41,260
person's house they harvest the

844
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,550
collection but new batteries him it

845
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,140
looks harmless but there was another

846
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:48,580
case I've worked where this was how the

847
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:53,250
ex was getting access to the mothers

848
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:56,860
email and banking through a nanny cam

849
00:34:53,250 --> 00:35:01,180
this is notice that okay happy

850
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:03,460
presentation right apples now integrated

851
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,290
ear pods into the hearing aid you can

852
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,600
see the ear down here you can leave your

853
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,580
phone and connect it to your phone to

854
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,020
your ear pods and walk out with your

855
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,020
front of the room and listen to the

856
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,540
conversation from 30 feet away something

857
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,490
else that you want you're a person who

858
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,200
might be in a bad situation because it

859
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,240
they've left their phone there so

860
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,069
listening talking about your attorney

861
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,029
talking on planning your escape getting

862
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:32,500
an apartment this is now high-tech gear

863
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:35,020
that's been doing purposed Bluetooth

864
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,060
very simple got 10 minutes left so we'll

865
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,320
have to speed through this you turn your

866
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,730
Bluetooth on use something like net

867
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,560
toolbox and you can see if there's

868
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,060
Bluetooth listening in around you can

869
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,220
see if there's any rogue devices again

870
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,380
if there is take a screenshot save it

871
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,660
for the police

872
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,490
tracking

873
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:54,640
yes Amazon sells trackers they advertise

874
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:56,560
it's for spouses it's about the size of

875
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,359
a pack of card signals under a car for

876
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:03,750
$25 a month you can watch where the car

877
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:08,050
goes but I'm glad to talk really fast

878
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:09,400
that's great but you don't need that

879
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,320
because if you're on a family plan the

880
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,970
family plan owner for t-mobile now gets

881
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,340
all the data that's collected from car

882
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,230
to limitary since the account plan

883
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,760
holder and he can still see the same

884
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:22,630
amount of data as if he had the beacon

885
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,750
for the car it's like this which isn't

886
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:28,240
actually a GPS beacon that state of

887
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:31,990
ripped from an image Typhon of data

888
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,910
being sent back to the service for

889
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,379
Facebook to advertise for the users Bhim

890
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,359
if you have access to the phone because

891
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,550
you didn't change your password you have

892
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,730
the same physical collection as if you

893
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:45,790
had had a beacon under the car so the

894
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:48,280
old-school p.i methods well bypassed by

895
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,600
social media fitness beacons if your

896
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,430
friends worried about being stalked

897
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,150
because a fitness became advertising for

898
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:56,430
the run jog very simply stop it

899
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:59,020
nobody cares what your jogging route is

900
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:02,649
we'll get by if they don't know how long

901
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,120
you ran then bluej Road nobody cares

902
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,690
leave the beacon the homie Florida about

903
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,180
being stalked very simple all right you

904
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,890
know right go order pizza you're done

905

Domino's retains your past few years of

906
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,870
locations and orders so if you forgot

907
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,879
just like felt ID remit solar could but

908
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,290
it checks out well I'm still under there

909
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,380
Domino's I can see where they ordered

910
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:24,790
pizza where they are same thing I don't

911
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,990
have to hack your iPhone to get your

912
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,410

ordering pizza for pizza Fridays

914
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:34,509
identity theft it's binary they have

915
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:37,660
access if there's identity theft

916
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:39,700
identity theft gov great website the

917
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,770
abuser has pressure opportunity

918
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,060
rasterization the fraud triangle you

919
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,040
know why I have to pay for around my own

920
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,500
they owe this to me I supported them

921
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,150
during this tough time I'm going to take

922
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,490
this much fun them on putting a credit

923
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:53,380
card in their name very simple you know

924
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:58,299
there's identity theft or there's not if

925
00:37:53,380 --> 00:38:00,190
there is good identity theft i gov have

926
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,940
no important get an FTC number work with

927
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,550
the banks

928
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,110
very quickly spoof card lets you copy

929
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:09,320
even the bank phone number so you can

930
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:10,790
put in city banks fraud desk number to

931
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,890
call a victim it's going to show up his

932
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:15,140
city bank so they have to be more where

933
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:17,569
someone calls him with information to

934
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,330
help them out it may not actually be who

935
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,190
it appears to be because something like

936
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,819
this shows up Apple's new update on the

937
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:28,160
iOS has a check mark like Twitter has

938
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,510
verified users the new check mark on the

939
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,750
iOS is going to say this is for my

940
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:36,200
trusted legitimate source so you've

941
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,550
covered data confidentiality control

942
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,240
your environment we talked about

943
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:44,000
identity theft data availability if it

944
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,500
ain't documented it ain't the CIA

945
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,840
version is if it ain't in cable traffic

946
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:51,950
any but half the crowd may not know what

947
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,450
cable traffic is like working with a

948
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,250
sock where everything is backed up you

949
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,419
know you have your corporate network a

950
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,250
laptop on the network

951
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,140
everything synced constantly you've got

952
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,300
all the data backup to the sock there's

953
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,150
an off-site there's a disaster recovery

954
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:07,580
site you don't have that you have the

955
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,590
one USB drive where he talks about or

956
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,090
she talks about yes I did sort of a

957
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,130
thing I've been doing this it's

958
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,630
something greatly helps your victim to

959
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,160
close the case move on you know or

960
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,530
string or file charges

961
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,259
doesn't matter I'm like corporate

962
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:29,720
America you have one maybe two pieces of

963
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:31,250
information that can change the case so

964
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,730
you want to document that now write down

965
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:38,750
this file on this state on this time

966
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:40,670
have a backup copy this is me but I like

967
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,980
to have a primary alternate contingency

968
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,260
and emergence in your pace now here's

969
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,210
the original it's Ana safe-deposit box a

970
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,500
copy was left with the attorney sent to

971
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,760
the police and the copy that I'm going

972
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,420
to work on to help this person through

973
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,860
your case the tertiary copy the others

974
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,690
are there so even if something goes

975
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,940
wrong with the first or second Drive I

976
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,410
still have a backup because this USB

977
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,810
Drive is the only thing that make a

978
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:06,109
difference in the case I'm not hoping

979
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:10,570
that SanDisk's Drive isn't going to tell

980
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:13,670
anybody ever had a USB Drive fail right

981
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,750
another key thing being available for

982
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,610
the other person they're coming to

983
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,180
not just a technical problem this is a

984
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:21,320
lifestyle it's not badging out and

985
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,230
leaving the socket the end of the day

986
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,370
this person lives this problem 24/7

987
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,380
they've come to you probably after

988
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:30,109
debating overnight you can help them be

989
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,030
available for them not just tailored it

990
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,740
just be a normal decent person because

991
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,340
this is a horrible thing this won't last

992
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:39,080
forever for them but at least it's

993
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,610
something more than a sans question it's

994
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:47,569
a lifestyle problem that they're dealing

995
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:50,210
with and it's just a bad situation two

996

is one one is none that goes back to

997
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:57,830
primary alternate contingency emerges if

998
00:40:52,310 --> 00:41:03,680
you don't make a backup so very quickly

999

we don't need the information anymore

1003
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,839
they've lost access for whatever reason

1004
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:17,859
policy changed we've seen it done great

same thing he had a device show up on

its network that's great that's exactly

1047

00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:12,390
and the abuser comes back in the house

1054
00:43:11,279 --> 00:43:15,420
they're going to respond differently

1055
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,650
then we've got we are separated but he's

1056
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,690
back in the house and I don't want him

1057
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:22,769
there versus I changed the locks he

1058
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,970
broke in then we respond differently we

1059
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,169

what do you mean she asked does it

1079
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:16,529
matter what you've collected and I would

1080
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:19,229

it's yes I've moved out on this date yes

1082
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:24,180
I'm seeing somebody it all depends on

1083
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:27,120
what state it is in South Carolina if

1084
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:31,049

somebody need okay you can't collect

1087
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,970

mated you're seeing somebody new then

1089
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:41,009
we're not divorced that could be

1090
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,510
considered evidence the downside is you

1091
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,880
actually have to prove it's from a cell

1092
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:48,980
phone not just a text printout from I

1093
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,980
spoofed XCOM or somewhere like that so

1094
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:59,970
depends not maybe the answer you wanted

1095
00:45:52,050 --> 00:46:05,400
then it depends on the attorney the

1096
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:08,419
judge and all right I've got swag for

1097
