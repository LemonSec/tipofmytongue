apologies like I said I there some

computer that's multiplier basically may

00:01:45,590 --> 00:02:06,800
be summed up pretty quickly

00:01:47,210 --> 00:02:09,380
I'm old I knew a lot of stuff 25 years

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,609
of experience too big to keep that up

10
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,049
I'm going to have to talk about that

11
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,330
it's great for people starting their

12
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,400
career it's a great way to asking HR

13
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,769
Cougars that are integral to their job

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,920

cheat sheet slide which is like all the

20
00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:04,750
or elsewhere everything from this office

21
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:08,590
my early violet one's listening but they

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,900
went so um purpose of this talk was

23
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,160
trying to combine thing I took last year

24
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,650
I've been talking for some family

25
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,090
reasons so I apologize in advance this

26
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,470
hearts would be all over the place I'm

27
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,420
actually gonna turn this is more of a

28
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,310
training the future a dirty laundry so

29
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,349
this is coming covered lots of different

30
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,120
wireless related stuff cover some of the

31
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:27,369
basics proposed may not know anything

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,049
and then hope this abuse ever goes you

33
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,000
know a lot there's no zero dates

34
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:33,420
probably a lot of people operating this

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,230
boring I'm really sorry advanced but

36
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,790
anyways the main goal is to talk about

37
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,590
red teaming what people think about that

38
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,260
a teaming talk about our ads and respect

39
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,090
the red teaming and then just a 7/32

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,739
think outside of the box for outside of

41
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,139
the scope so first off this one was

42
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:56,680
probably this was a controversial but

43
00:03:53,139 --> 00:04:00,340
red teaming about five years ago the

44
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,510
whole scheme of order engine companies

45
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,510

52
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:53,810
this is how I view the basic the certain

53
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,969
basic service that essentially is the

54
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,389
extended service identifier again is the

55
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:05,520
network name but penalty seeing this

56
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,909
picture is if you have multiple movies

57
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,029
for all broadcasting the same name that

58
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:14,009
allows for roaming in society and the

59
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:19,169
PNL Burnett worthless that's all the

60
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:20,339
networks at your laptop Antonio's and I

61
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,549
just have to point out if anyone's

62
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:24,959
notice that his pictures in Russian I

63
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,419
was looking for you quick graphic and

64
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:34,380
Wikipedia had multiple sizes free and it

65
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:36,299
was in Russian so we're kiss your basic

66
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,189
attacks the original one was equal to an

67
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,588
attack while earlier these so as you

68
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,510
show up somewhere to new boss coffee

69
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:44,130
shop how do I access my called Bob's

70
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,069
coffee shop and you've literally sent me

71
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,170
yup all that there's nothing too

72
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:51,149
exciting about that it literally was

73
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,990
just to try to get people think you are

74
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,970
the real access point with roaming in

75
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,399
the concepts of roaming built into Wi-Fi

76
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,769
networks it the idea here was that

77
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,630
you're enticement conversion enticement

78
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,699
was pretty much make sure your signal is

79
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,980
stronger than devices will give you over

80
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:24,479
the real guy or coercion it's a nice way

81
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:25,980
of saying so the names rural attack was

82
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,640
the car right back we all know about

83
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,189
this is scary thing that's 15 years old

84
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,199
it literally was the modified post DVD

85
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:38,969
software we listen to people sitting

86
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:42,540
there bees and in responding

87
00:09:38,970 --> 00:10:01,800
specifically to though so it was you

88
00:09:42,540 --> 00:10:05,370
know whose paper drives were very very

89
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,719
versatile one of the ways that kind of

90
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,519
stopped working

91
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,310
might as well could be picked up on this

92
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,240
so the modified person is attacked back

93
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,920
and what he was the man of that and

94
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,709
essentially the main difference here is

95
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,589
it was more directed you listen to or

96
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:27,319
request for this side even do specific

97
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:27,319
responses back to the specific devices

98
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,839
so variations on the stack it is kind of

99
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,709
more similar to you car know where it is

100
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,899
a lot as a correspondent and it's kind

101
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:43,010
of funny thing with Macclesfield exactly

102
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,010
because people started

103
00:10:45,440 --> 00:12:06,800
so this is pretty much it is the pna-x

104
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:11,070
the basic concept behind this is

105
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,469
essentially your master and there were

106
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,110
ways to get this by stealing enforcing

107
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:19,730
the pole for weight and shape which is

108
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,730
totally doable especially something

109
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:47,890
but the point is depending on what you

110
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:57,029
are getting now new funding I recently

111
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:57,029
did some Amazons and

112
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:08,229
I didn't exercise where I had a big

113
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,670
lunch passwords and I have another

114
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,040
little bomb that I think I promised

115
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:15,128
spent about four hundred bucks whatever

116
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:20,469
back to look and actual she uses a habit

117
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:22,269
you know created $14 for but instead of

118
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,429
you know thirty forty thousand dollars I

119
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:28,749
spent 300 bucks got the average crime

120
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:33,509
and those actions so this is up gets

121
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:33,509
over a lot easier and again what's also

122
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:46,719
is possible impacts individual hope this

123
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,480
was kind of dropped over the hash at

124
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:58,209
forms and ebony out figure out how to do

125
00:14:49,480 --> 00:15:03,970
it one way those made a lot easier

126
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:05,679
there's a guy a butcher's named Ellie

127
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,600
who goes by the name of the do the

128
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:12,459
socket really has a piece of software

129
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,290
called better gap that about two years

130
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:17,079
there's an updated version and this

131
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,998
golden feather cap is to be just the

132
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:22,868
Swiss Army knife for man-in-the-middle

133
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:24,669
attacks and crazy added east streamline

134
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:27,819
the process with speed and ease and

135
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:30,360
makes it student Liseberg you can have a

136
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:30,360
beauty mask

137
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,920
another project did

138
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,680
no sex panther tanks I see many people

139
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,140
around this poverty of these is in what

140
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,699
he's calling the Pullman batch which if

141
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,439
you look at it you know to talk about

142
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,829
you you can see where he was going

143
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,820
I'm sure the video with little things

144
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:56,979
like it talked about you it is a

145
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:03,670
Raspberry Pi zero over the screen

146
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:13,269
optional driver and basically a device

147
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:15,459
that the client saw and what he sees it

148
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:19,810
broadcasts help and assist there and

149
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:24,399
gets it to a status thing is a boy it

150
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:26,229
very much is on you must look at a lot

151
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,620
of people proper look at this one

152
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,980
o'clock

153
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,630
what's the point of this but my take on

154
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,750
this especially the red team this is

155
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,029
being is this is something teeny that

156
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,970
fits in your pocket and you'll know how

157
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,800
big they are advertised for example

158
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,570
that's actually my wedding ring next to

159
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,199
it so we're talking a device that's very

160
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,790
very small so my take on this is any

161
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,709
time that I was anywhere near any when I

162
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,439
buy my passions edit work with I have

163
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,219
this money in my matter uses a small bag

164
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,950
great injustice

165
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,399
Eric runs so I'm walking in you dress up

166
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:10,990
this and I have a bag and interviews

167
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:15,000
sometimes just runs no one knows where

168
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,000
they so that's what the great part about

169
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,959
so what more said her name's Louisa

170
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,639
cover we've all heard a crack which is

171
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,459
essentially human installation package

172
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,079
allows replay attacks I want to make

173
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,960
sure that was covered and recently

174
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,269
actually while it is a 20

175
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,549
these last week at RSA an attack called

176
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:36,350
crook which was actually discovered by

177
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:39,500
people testing apparently originally

178
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:42,279
Amazon echoed with generation 1 or crack

179
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:46,940
and the freaking dirty about this is

180
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:50,179
basically they found some types of Wi-Fi

181
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,330
socks or system on ships that once they

182
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:56,419
disassociate from an access point being

183
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:59,059
quite the in actual heat in their memory

184
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:01,010
two zeros try to clear what the problem

185
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,230
is is then they found based on how that

186
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,450
 was written and programming the if

187
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,880
there were some packets into the bunker

188
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,220
Levison you can send those out but now

189
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,130
that means development is therapy so if

190
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,529
you found applicable targets literally

191
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:18,649
cause of this association that while

192
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:20,990
sniffing all my traffic leftist and it

193
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:23,299
was in a or two rotated of my little

194
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,190
packets with a zero P with using gain

195
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:26,779
compression the reason this is

196
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,870
interesting as it kind of strikes me is

197
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,730
almost like partly where our will become

198
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,928
so memory but we kept doing it long

199
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,789
enough to start getting interesting

200
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:36,889
stuff there's no reason you can describe

201
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,289
this constantly positive disassociation

202
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:41,178
back time to the way that probably the N

203
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,830
news wouldn't even know suffering while

204
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:45,679
so sucking in all this information is

205
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,120
you later practice obviously if you're

206
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,659
sitting in a coffee shop this is a

207
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,158
little boring not that interesting but

208
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:55,659
if you have a specific target and as

209
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,659
information about me get here though

210
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,720
[Music]

211
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:07,360
this is kind of this is something

212
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,280
happened

213
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,750
but again in recent putting these

214
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,190
contacts schools in here just to show

215
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,130
that Wow

216
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:18,510
Wi-Fi attacks around forever much harder

217
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:38,260
to be keep stuff moving encourages

218
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:41,460
specials so we want to lose you

219
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,460
predominantly low-energy

220
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:49,030
recording 32 led you have gathered

221
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:52,540
reviews kind of protocol underneath

222
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:57,090
their services they're usually UUID

223
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,090
those of you IDs are usually 16

224
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:16,418
characteristics these services actually

225
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:20,379
true for all of us is government basic

226
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:22,390
concept how they paired any you know

227
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,040
like locked or something is a peripheral

228
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:33,429
you can talk with one sniff advise a

229
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:35,110
time that's your so hard work if you're

230
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:37,169
gonna start playing with Bluetooth ever

231
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:40,270
midnight you gotta send out of beauty

232
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,190
101 thing that I've never noticed is a

233
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,660
lot of times they just say get one of

234
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,220
these absolutely can

235
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,580
there's actually models these compose

236
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:51,040
the Mosel mind partly 100 g o3 or Q or

237
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,500
which work great but I found there is

238
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,970
only one model and might be wrong only

239
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,210
got no model

240
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,460
liturgy and that's the 100 a they don't

241
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:05,230
sell me more I just really want another

242
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:07,240
one online used it was a little

243
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,560
expensive but they're handy if you can

244
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,360
find one of these to do something

245
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,460
because Low Energy easy enough that

246
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,459
buying online instructions on how to get

247
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,940
the only device cracked open disconnect

248
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,830
the antenna actually makes the picture

249
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,680
on the left or the right rather is I

250
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,750
have this Amazon fire TV think that

251
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,370
walked up a ton alright when I watch

252
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:31,330
live TV so one night were watching it

253
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,739
like that I got pissed off and I notice

254
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,149
in the corner that in this freeze frame

255
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,880
that just happen to freeze they're

256
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,040
perfectly for me it was this Senate

257
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,930
Beauty 100 plugging this hot car which I

258
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,940
have no idea why it's there if I had to

259
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:46,710
guess it's probably the axon body

260
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,710
humerus you see one of the car up there

261
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,710
next up our hardware slightly more

262
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,659
expensive I try to eat the sub sheet you

263
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,760
can get these for set theory to us used

264
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,400
if you have the money especially in

265
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,680
Florida paperwork I wouldn't do this is

266
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,870
the new Birju one it's me my great Scott

267
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,910
Dennis which is a guy in my hospital is

268
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,669
a ton of meat hardware the nice thing

269
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,870
about it is he does it even crapped on

270
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,870
my newest online

271
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:22,659
explaining rtl-sdr like constants find

272
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,310
it if you have one of these devices and

273
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,680
you think hey there's this wing them for

274
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,120
granted wacky and yelling try he's

275
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,890
probably ever done any one Lana could

276
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,229
you show me exactly how to do it so he

277
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,120
tries with a really great back so this

278
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,230
is great for some utility or looking at

279
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:46,239
current connections and stuff like that

280
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:48,100
so if you can get along I recommend if

281
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,870
you're doing this on your own and you

282
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,949
want a little bit less expensive this is

283
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,800
actually the Adafruit

284
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,630
friends I bought this use you know right

285
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,460
now I looked online is I think about 26

286
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,950
probably you know file ship here so I

287
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,420
want this a long time ago but it has

288
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,550
some basic software you came with it was

289
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,440
kind of crap people have actually worked

290
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,090
with this quite a bit and there's

291
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,820
everything from sniffers on github

292
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:13,189
there's a support for this so if you

293
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,800
want to get into V TLD on the cheap

294
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,570
this is probably where to go again this

295
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,440
beta room I think there's willing to

296
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:24,919
begin for it for us BTS pays every 26

297
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,080
bucks for a video if you're starting

298
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,090
lose you and you're somewhere Angeles or

299
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,730
discovering stuff a great tool is the

300
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,110
new hyperbola just working on the second

301
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,120
least a few years ago by the

302
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,979
stress guys you can do this with just

303
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,840
any Bluetooth Africa movie whatever see

304
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,140
laptop right now if you have a sitting

305
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,419
as people another matter tight though

306
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,580
that's fantastic you can't hit on there

307
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,470
you can add an optional to Purdue to

308
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,689
assist in finding active the connections

309
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,310
to get more info if you don't know what

310
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,140
you're looking for or even already

311
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,879
location like your retargeting office

312
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,560
this is a great way to see what's there

313
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:11,510
get an idea of the partners there and

314
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:13,310
see their supplies and another tool per

315
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,050
day than this is Beauty standard comes

316
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:19,600
with County it's nice and simple

317
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:23,450
it doesn't what you as thorough a job as

318
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:26,030
blue binder but it's nice and simple

319
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,070
it's kind of low it doesn't require a

320
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,800
lot CPU uses you're basically do the

321
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,510
doctors nice thing is if you've seen an

322
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,899
advice up there's one more to go about

323
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,470
you sit and turn

324
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,870
about the features of that place has

325
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,640
this is looking at a cheap headset I've

326
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,129
got so obviously you can see audio/video

327
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,080
headset the interesting thing about that

328
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,790
is you got rendering audio my pensions

329
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,000
go through fire justice got a microphone

330
00:24:47,790 --> 00:25:14,639
on that which is very useful potentially

331
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:17,970
depending on this is the BBC micro the

332
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,490
holder host in the room may recall if I

333
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,920
spelled easy micro back in the early

334
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:25,620
eighties BBC is really Broadcasting

335
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,110
Corporation have a push of a kind of

336
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,489
literacy and education program where

337
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,219
they want to release their own computer

338
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,050
really called BBC micro and they did

339
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,700
that there's coming up eight or back in

340
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:39,030
the day that don't report them they were

341
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,470
expensive they did their best with the

342
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,990
funding they have to actually provide

343
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,270
these two schools to lower cost the BBC

344
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:48,210
micro actually even compared to our home

345
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,879
computer the day this is kind of fast

346
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,560
forward to now this is the BBC's attend

347
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,450
to do something stellar whether they

348
00:25:52,560 --> 00:26:00,419
actually is BBC micro is they provide

349
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:01,680
them to a schools totally free as you

350
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,970
can probably guess in looking at this is

351
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,800
not a bullet less computer this is

352
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,380
something probably to compete so to

353
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,450
speak with Arduino as you see it's got

354
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,980
well led you kind of display on that

355
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,930
little button see the program something

356
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,120
you've my whole game but where this is

357
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:18,180
interesting is it's got a full fledged

358
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,310
btle interface into it and this guy

359
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,990
Damien he ran out how to program your

360
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:25,080
firmware to it to do something more

361
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,509
exciting which is predominantly

362
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,189
see who think what's fun about this as

363
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:32,879
brand new these are a few books of hop

364
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,619
off of Amazon his code can take those

365
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:36,119
three spoil of the channel sending back

366
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:36,749
and forth between those so basically the

367
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:39,840
bastards

368
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:41,610
I bought two on eBay use forty bucks oh

369
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,799
yeah this is especially important play

370
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,748
with so you know if you can't definite

371
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,220
always get your terp a port you can't

372
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:51,779
read yourself this is doesn't you play

373
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,669
together so this is a quick example on

374
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:56,159
the left is it will be bringing

375
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:57,960
currently activated connections on the

376
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,179
right and then actually trying to sip

377
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,519
that connection as you see it got how to

378
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:07,049
talk to it started pulling my bleep data

379
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:08,519
out of it and the goal would be then to

380
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:10,109
actually try to take over that

381
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,080
connection which is a successful this

382
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:14,730
case um once you take over a connection

383
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,710
which you do that is discover services

384
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,289
and the services like we saw on the e

385
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,879
key standard list it has the ability to

386
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:23,519
send and receive audio and stuff like

387
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:25,859
that you can read it right do you like

388
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,960
these and then you can also do like

389
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:30,029
straight link data which is the link

390
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,489
layer data which is essentially raw

391
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:35,700
packets packet look to it well above my

392
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:37,980
head pressures a lot smarter with that

393
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,909
the next thing about this software is a

394
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,799
super super easy to use Isis Linux paste

395
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,570
from the first version released the last

396
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,399
party of even has its own automates

397
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,470
coming the right from our locking device

398
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,908
so you get the software you plug these

399
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,489
things in your community type utility

400
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:55,950
jack - I it will install the software on

401
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:58,379
BBC micro disk and then remove the layer

402
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:01,409
that pretty destroyed during this we get

403
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:03,119
up pass all the patient uses a lot more

404
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:05,369
in-depth there's a lot more growth house

405
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,749
their balls as I mentioned I'm a vision

406
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:07,100
for this party which range would

407
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:16,910
actually

408
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:18,469
this but there's another piece of

409
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:21,710
software it's better a fleeting vision

410
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,179
earlier like I said these guys evil

411
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,919
socket wanted to make this the

412
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:27,140
restarting night that he calls it from

413
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,660
all out of Italy and it almost is like

414
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,010
in general never granted the milling in

415
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,880
your direct management network

416
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:36,169
integration traffic I was telling Joe

417
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,429
earlier I used the early version of

418
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:38,929
better Kathy one of my favorite

419
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,730
restaurants got on their guest Wi-Fi

420
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,380
figured help did the in-house

421
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,840
entertainment was on the same network

422
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,820
and started sniffing man building it

423
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,980
where I actually start getting XML data

424
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,780
that was explaining what the system in

425
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,000
the restaurant was talking to you I see

426
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,770
people license server of let's songs in

427
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,929
one of the play and like I was finding

428
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,039
lists of the song before they played the

429
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:00,320
sax from albums

430
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:02,658
it was just on and that's yet another

431
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:09,530
looking better crap does as you see here

432
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:11,179
look blue to low it works fine it's miss

433
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,668
it once you start seeing these devices

434
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,740
you then you break those devices once

435
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,450
that happens similar to be Taylor Jack

436
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,299
you can buy those services on these

437
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:24,530
devices you can rewrite you you IDs on

438
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:28,000
them lots of stuff to do so all the

439
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:32,360
topic rewriting me uneasy services I

440
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,730
would will deny saying that I have ever

441
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,500
used these software to find stuff like

442
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,929
people's fitbit's or something like that

443
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,600
and renaming them clever but I've seen

444
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:44,510
things that's easy to do most of these

445
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,199
devices it's really simple do share with

446
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:50,840
your friends

447
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:53,059
it doesn't hurt those devices but at the

448
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,770
end of the day on use renamed the body

449
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,559
students that's cute what does that

450
00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:00,408
really get you so another thing about

451
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:03,010
this talk was did not be useful are and

452
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:05,380
to move the other side red teaming that

453
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,330
maybe like how this internally or the

454
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,790
physical encounter where babies tremors

455
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,679
are in summer so this was a great

456
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,350
example I saw this guy biggest of us

457
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,210
this loss of IMT so you know you could

458
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,300
write to these services so is that very

459
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,890
interesting people II grabbed this walk

460
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,050
and it's literally have had water in his

461
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,910
view he sent the traffic after setting

462
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,460
the password to one two three four five

463
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,380
six solid go through the leader text and

464
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,150
saw where it was going he actually

465
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,220
grabbed an application and dumbed it and

466
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:36,550
found him very bluntly it says exactly

467
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,680
the addresses of where everything is so

468
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,050
at that point all he did was figured out

469
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,610
how to rewrite the reset the password it

470
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,399
needs to unlock this within a few

471
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:47,500
seconds so obviously this is a kind of

472
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,390
cheap padlock we can run into this in

473
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,790
when you say business environment you're

474
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,410
actually attacking your business

475
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:56,170
probably not could you go back and look

476
00:30:53,410 --> 00:31:01,080
at a lot of stuff especially IOT blocks

477
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:01,080
over the past four years this is

478
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:17,410
surprisingly easy so current exploits

479
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:21,700
for losers I have no idea me too these

480
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:24,280
were recently released say it was in

481
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:28,180
fact created first major the LD socks

482
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:30,670
system on ship so one of these CDs most

483
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,490
likely impact anything you have that's

484
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:35,380
doing the feeling of course that most of

485
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:38,160
these are crashes so there's

486
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:43,030
questionable how much you know that

487
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,830
necessarily help you some of the actual

488
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:47,050
software that they provide for PFCs

489
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,669
actually uses what's called the NR a--

490
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,310
community where domville

491
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,170
that is ten bucks on Mouser right now

492
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,510
and we may give everything action

493
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:58,150
/ - it you don't need the special like

494
00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:02,020
program or anything is one reason what

495
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:03,990
he was about to machine plates and then

496
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:08,350
do these beauties

497
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:10,630
so the bulk of the season is like I said

498
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,850
he would cause you know a walk state on

499
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:18,510
the device or Boston review a lot of

500
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:18,510
these hands of you or various other box

501
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,800
my process of it is is the technical

502
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:37,540
term in office I always thought like

503
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:40,780
crashing potentially cause that depends

504
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,460
on the building do me they decide well

505
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,620
again you got to be kind of creative

506
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:50,500
because again these are just blocks or

507
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:52,719
dead center piece I might not this was

508
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:56,080
back to these awardees super great stuff

509
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,850
actually particle is increasing these

510
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,649
companies are starting to have people do

511
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,750
tests on their in setting this week

512
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,460
there's c-suite of those and a lot of

513
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,050
times was being honest those folks did a

514
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,060
penny on stress they are in technology

515
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:10,510
industry or not have the money to spend

516
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:13,270
on things like you don't 300 of the box

517
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,740
so potentially maybe that's something

518
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:20,920
that probably well look into in this

519
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:25,870
person's so the last one that is had one

520
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:28,600
interesting one is this one is a

521
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:33,399
specific site that's used decently

522
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:35,320
really not but it it receives a out were

523
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,270
limited version of West while I was

524
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,710
trying to compare him for some reason it

525
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,049
says

526
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,330
zero heat and this is the long-term -

527
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:44,700
you wish in new - man is that he is

528
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:48,600
gonna think mr. improvisation packages

529
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,370
device similar to the crook attack that

530
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,668
means that you have to see repeats in

531
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:55,590
you did you can get advice in the state

532
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:58,049
then just suck it all the traffic you

533
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:00,750
can use the bracket in the suck whatever

534
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:02,730
gets you we get independent advice you

535
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:05,610
could directly connect to device and

536
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:06,990
services that it has back to the lock

537
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,819
example who knows if there's something

538
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,790
where you can unlock something Chris get

539
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,800
more information but that's the more you

540
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,699
about that doesn't come loose inhale

541
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,460
release

542
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:20,158
so again thank you partner Clark temple

543
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,949
is also to make this too physical to

544
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,960
access not just being a little party so

545
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:27,418
in this one to question was what is just

546
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,490
access to get us we're both Wi-Fi and

547
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,949
Bluetooth depending on where you're at

548
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:34,259
home low visibility ceiling so hard

549
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:35,969
we're taking on the inner part most of

550
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,609
this hardware literally will have the

551
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:42,118
basic configuration on a small class

552
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:44,219
ship like the one you see there the

553
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,409
grumpy run into is depending on if you

554
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,259
need to refer this thing a lot of times

555
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,379
these should require power in terms of

556
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,139
data

557
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:54,629
offer them which then sometimes power

558
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,220
their device is very common talking

559
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:58,529
about lose yourself and Wi-Fi because

560
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:03,169
they're all wired together very simply

561
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:05,730
and it doesn't quite a lot of hours the

562
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:09,060
problem is a lot of these whose SPI is

563
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:11,750
on the CPU and natural flash chip so the

564
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,740
CDs are talking kind of Rebecca mention

565
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,300
easiest way would be used something like

566
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,750
shipboard actions where we've mentioned

567
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:21,970
entirely civil connecting that ship

568
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:24,580
the other option through this is if you

569
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,950
can find some way to put the CD human to

570
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,410
a reset state years ago they would call

571
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,000
this subtype regular Park we're happy to

572
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,649
get around the state difficult in

573
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,550
getting people to back we're at some

574
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:42,010
cases from nzg policy deposit to reset

575
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:44,320
that's possible in some cases but again

576
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,240
BTUs by borrowed you just do now 1830

577
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,120
law then apparently panels you're

578
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,500
grabbing if there's possibly other

579
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,390
property like right to the right to see

580
00:35:50,500 --> 00:36:00,490
that's actually at work in the cable

581
00:35:52,390 --> 00:36:02,230
console access so you get what if I the

582
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,089
examples actually wanted to put on your

583
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:15,220
I didn't have time was I always thought

584
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:16,600
to steal one to then but the other thing

585
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,560
that dollar people on these to be steal

586
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,480
dead bones and do lazy but not break-in

587
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,920
just parent to your laptop even closer

588
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:57,060
like if you're like a wall party

589
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:57,060
shooters okay so I'm jacking derivatives

590
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,670
distill research female Mouse tracking

591
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,290
back in 2016 basically the quickie areas

592
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:10,360
they figured out that logitech's

593
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:14,140
adapters keeping the body testers so

594
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,340
much that others did not do too well

595
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:20,529
with having information

596
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:22,870
easy to walk back to live and have a

597
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:25,750
think your mouth full of the best part

598
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:28,390
no mercy either to a mouse that that's a

599
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,860
good interface device so you get into

600
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,890
that to start something he throws his

601
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,240
way and it's like a little good the

602
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,859
crates the creative creating is a USB

603
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,930
stick that makes it all better but much

604
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,050
Amazon it was made specifically for

605
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:43,540
trolling Thrones but there's more again

606
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:47,770
- it's got extra content part of this

607
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:49,720
was to get a lot of papers back to

608
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:51,730
better gal kinetic app actually supports

609
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,169
mousetrap very well this is a quick

610
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,550
example and this was actually announced

611
00:37:53,170 --> 00:38:00,150
again this is bouncing off these

612
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:04,050
rebounded connected to it sniffing solid

613
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:07,480
mouse access or immediately better Cal

614
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:09,280
Turk eventually it is great because it

615
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,900
lets you can see all the traffic I lost

616
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,670
them how even have that mouse connected

617
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:17,020
salsa this like wait this is my favorite

618
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:22,870
lighting stuff the next thing about it

619
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:28,230
is better galaxies together something

620
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:28,230
had a bank of course live living

621
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:35,410
it all works back to fast track the main

622
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,480
goal there is instead of having to do

623
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:45,420
this especially English your party might

624
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:45,420
open this with my secretary and advice

625
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,730
backing I'll start with 2016 soul of

626
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:56,680
this that's dead right

627
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:00,760
thank you don't think the past is good

628
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,470
because they always a lot of people are

629
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,000
not patching this stuff and then

630
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,069
recently there's kind of Artists Agency

631
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,320
released some stuff it's very similar

632
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,810
collage attacker which actually loves

633
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,180
item in a ESP SOP that compassion and

634
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:16,180
updated Logitech stuff they would sniff

635
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:18,190
on parent she convinced encrypted we do

636
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,169
reject Eastwood pieces you learning

637
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:26,710
thumbs and also some other games in

638
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:29,770
Japanese with stuff that you have to on

639
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,230
11 cm RF definitely mentioned earlier we

640
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,720
do stuff that actually useful aaj Becker

641
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:37,210
as well on the right is advice from the

642
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,399
people brother this is a nice thing

643
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,680
about that is externally in distance

644
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:52,090
device the left 10 bucks device the rank

645
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:52,779
box in this case physical access what

646
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,420
does that get us

647
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,610
they actually created a JavaScript

648
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,680
program that you could post somewhere so

649
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,390
have physical access go to either get

650
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,950
into it go to JavaScript and it's the

651
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,290
right version and you have a primer for

652
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,240
home I knew this might be a lot of data

653
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,400
in some places you getting to dump to

654
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:18,279
keep there and save it and we go on your

655
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:20,470
way and it more quickly other are like I

656
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,180
said I didn't want to focus on a.m. to

657
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:28,990
11 so that I could be able to cover some

658
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:31,339
other stuff in the CIT md380 is that

659
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:34,040

00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,870
push new poverty years ago I won't get

669
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,120
into that

670
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:01,630
that's just racing pretty dirty both has

671
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,029
double I use the local I need advice

672
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:07,810
dress code letters immigration on their

673
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:10,790
CBS programming software what you use

674
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:12,590
DMR essentially digital radio what this

675
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:16,840
is is all it's just like your cable TV

676
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,840
individual it takes 25 megahertz band

677
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,560
the heckler mark was it yes team are

678
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,630
works by sending out messages with the

679
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,850
LLL be saying okay this is going to work

680
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,290
this device so then when your device

681
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:32,299
guess it's like is this my hairline

682
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,140
equal gameplay no system I like the

683
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,700
whole play

684
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,220
Christopher's mobile discussion play

685
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,960
everything so if you're at environment

686
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,339
and potentially one you listening on say

687
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,840
security or anything else in that

688
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,080
environment this would be a great easy

689
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,550
way to do it notice the what kind of

690
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,680
cells about hundred most irritating

691
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:52,910
there's a few other variations obviously

692
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,450
the other puppies up don't spend a

693
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,700
hundred bucks

694
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,100
grab your SDR everyone should happen at

695
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,589
this point I hierarchical - mascara

696
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,720
conduct with great website presentation

697
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,970
they have their own devices actually

698
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,680
fantastic device 25 bucks to buy you

699
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:11,689
that in something pens nice gift

700
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,569
is this way

701
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:18,660
you're part of this compass the question

702
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,130
XP / - listen radio Hermes calm you're

703
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,109
gonna listen to everything from the

704
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:28,650
local law enforcement to Tropicana Field

705
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:30,450
do the similar Rock Cafe all SS speaking

706
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,040
SDRs we want to try to do I've done

707
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,870
Freda stocks recovery

708
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,820
everything from listening in to

709
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,380
information from alarm system so you can

710
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,840
see motion peckers get along with

711
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,370
everything you could potentially listen

712
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,380
to clickers are there were three pledged

713
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:46,770
both of light garage it will have

714
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:51,870
holding tote but also working pairs

715
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:53,790
another thing is is power years they can

716
00:42:51,870 --> 00:43:00,450
actually listen in to stuff output power

717
00:42:53,790 --> 00:43:03,810
meters and never lose hope there are

718
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:06,660
things for granted about this that the

719
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:10,279
various is the SPE eg 66 is used

720
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:12,299
moderately they need a lot of devices

721
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,310
micro-grant about the internet things is

722
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,470
it's an afterthought it always always

723
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,120
always is an afterthought people don't

724
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,480
think too much about it they add stuff

725
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,460
later

726
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,510
this is a qualm it's using cable

727
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,750
television for sending account

728
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:26,400
information they have internet

729
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,960
connectivity to this as an afterthought

730
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:33,030
and he seems like rational is but

731
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,100
because that was a great example of how

732
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:38,630
much only six are these are ESP devices

733
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,630
they use these little models in there

734
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:46,020
this is why this is you need 100 million

735
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,380
target entities chairs have been sent

736
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,150
out

737
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,640
I searched write it for more examples

738
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:53,520
and this company said they use these in

739
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,900
their toys and I'll let you guess what

740
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,490
word is learning that Duty box there now

741
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:04,640
current exploits again how to be able to

742
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:04,640
stuff a suburban alone living

743
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,520
so this

744
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,350
[Music]

745
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:24,880
all right well chocoberry yeah

746
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,250
basically the killer visas great package

747
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,320
much get a USB double up and running

748
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,510
with it it is very easy to search

749
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,700
Malcolm Isis as much potentially do with

750
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:35,350
that there's ways to protect those

751
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,049
devices get them off of this endeavor

752
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:41,200
they're all the other stuff I mean other

753
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:45,420
expandable you can actually say this

754
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,100
practical together marketer anymore

755
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,640
basically uses local imagination of the

756
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,580
magic

757
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,200
Wireshark right now and this is a packet

758
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,000
that I captured at my house and the

759
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,149
reason this was nice is just like a maxi

760
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,190
dress with insignia and they they

761
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,570
assigned to oh he lives the worst

762
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,340
convinced of the Mac interested

763
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:05,020
companies and this one packet I saw

764
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:17,609
wasn't doing something a little

765
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:17,609
interesting this is a house

766
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:25,710
so it is a company called a clock recent

767
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:28,290
a senior's thing is that I project in

768
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:32,010
these electric utilities gas fuel the

769
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:33,900
meters outside houses and in fact you as

770
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:35,580
I mentioned identified previously on ER

771
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,730
to get information out of these devices

772
00:47:35,580 --> 00:48:03,480
to standoff meters using how it goes and

773
00:47:38,730 --> 00:48:05,070
the reason that was Sidney X points son

774
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,240
this came out this is one recently

775
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:08,630
talked about this interesting from the

776
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,089
cooperage when people here how to send

777
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:14,280
hack firmware to a light within da

778
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:16,700
Chuan's a key bridge who forced them to

779
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:28,800
remove the light the repetitiveness

780
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:32,310
execute a the sure this off a while ago

781
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,589
they actually just patched it was very

782
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:37,980
useful check marks that they came out

783
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:39,930
there put your greasy waves every

784
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,690
competitor you can use any device that

785
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:46,669
those under one ear hurts radio using RF

786

cat analyst of the ends example of

787
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:50,550
courtesy apologies where is skinny for

788
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:52,859
networks and has the absolute majority

789
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,020
networks every quarter links off and on

790
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:56,310
I love that this buttons are there is

791
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,320
where to sometimes they don't work

792
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,270
sometimes it again in the bottom very

793
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,200
insular if you look all the lights off

794
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:06,480

that's the photo I wanted to use the

801
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:23,550
pendant my music rubber interview red

802
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:26,250
team it's an aerosol art isn't just

803
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:27,780
Wi-Fi our visit is useful really longer

804
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,060
than you can figure out why something

805
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,230
day this sometimes that's good enough

806
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,060
invented my energies always funding

807
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,430
increases part of this is the second one

808
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,690
no one bothers up a teaching partner and

809
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,040
if a lot of the stuff that covered was

810
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:40,290
kind of commercial validity from

811
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,509
consumer related stuff like that here's

812
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:44,850
people bring things into their office in

813
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,960
London yeah I remember I had a job back

814
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:48,360
when I used to smoke

815
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,080
I'm coming there day that's it's alive

816
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:55,140
cigarette well this is never going to

817
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:57,029
make it use this to me that was just no

818
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,850
it was directly inside network with zero

819
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:01,590
peppers anything to access outside I hit

820
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,720
up working since other part of security

821
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:05,640
now this was this was someone brought

822
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,959
likes a home net because they wanted to

823
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,910
fly the printer and closer to the office

824
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:17,550
knows only one net projects to use that

825
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:19,440
