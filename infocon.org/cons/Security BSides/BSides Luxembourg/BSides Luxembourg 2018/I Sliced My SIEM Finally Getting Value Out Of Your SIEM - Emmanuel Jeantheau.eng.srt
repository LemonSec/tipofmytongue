10
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:33,000
organizing thank you my second thank you

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,370

female speaker today and it's for her

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,828
because I think we are missing many many

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,070
women in our teams so thank you for all

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,600
the ladies are two buttons this this

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,890
besides you can't have them in the

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:54,089
forever and if you are yeah thanks for

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,149
and if you are looking for more women in

19
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:58,949
your team you can look at this project

20
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:01,350
cyber way friend dot-com

21
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,210
it's managed by one of my good friends

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,830
Patrick wheeler and actually it's a

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,680
three-year programs to bring more women

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,650
into our industry and so if you want to

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,660
is somebody and they have not necessary

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,790
IT security background but Patrick will

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,690
take care of them and bring them to the

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,460
good level for you Tim for you I can use

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,590
this Mme for two different things so

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,070
it's pretty cool I'm very sorry for the

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,260
title of my talk today when I received

32
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,410
the program I read all the talks and for

33
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,300
for me in my it was like super long

34
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,550
super commercial signal something like

35
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,340
this so basically put if it would have

36
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,229
been the object of an email i would put

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,140
directly to the trash because it's like

38
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,290
very very wonder but for sure i'm not

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,700
trying to sell to you anything and my

40
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,910
last thing he would be for you for being

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,670
here even if my my titles works so a

42
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,149
little bit about myself this is me and

43
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,730
this is a favorite picture of for my

44
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,860
girlfriend and that on the social media

45
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,980
you will see more something like this

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,560
which is i think of best way to discover

47
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,420
they do and trying to look for ship in

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,190
middle of lommers I'm not saying that

49
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,890
all my system means are llamas where

50
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,180
it's probably something that I'm trying

51
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,959
to look for the small differences

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,990
between my sis

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,610
means and the attackers what I've done

54
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,860
in my life I started my career in

55
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,030
decathlon and then I moved to cities

56
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,040
near al Albers vnp priorities and now

57
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,980
I'm working for MSS B and this luck is

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,959
basically that I started in big company

59
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,299
big Company B Company B Company and then

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,950
to MSSP well now I can see many many

61
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,260
different type of companies from the

62
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,119
very small ones with like ten service

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,399
but they still want security monitoring

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,470
and for the very big ones that start

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,820
their journey to to the cloud and say

66
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,430
okay because we are moving to the cloud

67
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:54,480
we need to have more security and then

68
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,000
security monitoring but about my current

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,329
employer today I'm off I'm on our days

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,610
it's not I'm not representing anyone I'm

71
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,410
here by myself and all opinions that I

72
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,290
will share today is not related to my

73
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,570
current employer so let's start with a

74
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,929
very very short history of our industry

75
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,480
anyone knows the very first malware

76
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:22,710
virus when it happened and the name of

77
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:26,850
the virus I can take it here for me it's

78
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:29,160
the wabbit virus in 1974 it's a very

79
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,040
very simple virus what he did it was

80
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,900
just implicates himself and at this time

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,019
the computer was very very low in memory

82
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,260
so at some point it will just break the

83
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,510
system creating a daniela service and

84
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:47,579
after that malware gets more more trendy

85
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:52,019
sorry and we had to add certain years to

86
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,600
get the first antivirus and we have the

87
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,690
very known magazine they are still here

88
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,760
and basically what is interesting is

89
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,910
that in this very same year Fred Cohen

90
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,049
wrote an article this is that

91
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,700
signature-based technology will never

92
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:10,470
work and you cannot very predict and a

93
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,989
malware because you know it from the

94
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,370
past and this is true because in 1990

95
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,930
you have dark Avenger mutation engine

96
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,760
that has been released so three years

97
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,290
after the first antivirus we have

98
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,450
already as a solution by the Red Team

99
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,970
the circus I will shuffle just my coat

100
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,099
and bypass all the antivirus and it

101
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,950
works

102
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,850
and then we say okay so now let's look

103
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,530
at the at the network and implement

104
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,660
Marbury four for the attacker

105
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:44,030
so the first state food firewall 1989

106
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,620
Application Firewall in 1994 and app

107
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,099
shield which is a web application

108
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:53,600
firewall in the in this very twenty year

109
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:57,380
where internet start to bloom what we

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,530
had after was okay so we block them but

111
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,960
still they they they can go through our

112
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,169
firewall on very common ports so why not

113
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,810
just another eyes in the traffic and see

114
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:12,680
what is wrong in the in the traffic so

115
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,800
we had broke twenty years ago which is

116
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,000
now Zeke it's not and ANSI ricotta in

117
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,680
2010 and and then basically what we have

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,420
done as an industry is to create more

119
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,710
and more complexity because the the

120
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,690
system that we were monitoring we're

121
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:32,539
also more and more complex

122
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:34,880
so in 22 2005 Gardner said okay so now

123
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,720
we need something to just bring all the

124
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,790
complexities that we are putting since

125
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,990
fifteen years to a single tool so that

126
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,790
it will resolve all our problems and

127
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,640
then we say okay but now I have

128
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,740
everything in my seam but I don't know

129
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,380
what to look for so I say okay so let's

130
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,150
start to share IOC Lester to shop at I

131
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:01,130
got techniques and we creates a

132
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:03,169
threatened agent in 2010 but in the same

133
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:07,580
time in 2010 is the first time that we

134
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:09,860
see Stuxnet and it's pretty interesting

135
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:14,500
because when I first time I read about

136
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:21,380
Stuxnet I was fighting another worm

137
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:24,230
color configure sorry another coffee

138
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,120
cursor I was fighting configure in the

139
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,950
Catalan in the same time I read the

140
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,940
words Texans which is like two different

141
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,469
firm that sir so so different compared

142
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,230
to the size the complexity and so on and

143
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:39,710
so on but what we forget a little bit is

144
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:42,169
that in our security industry we were

145
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,159
people fighting since 1960s

146
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:47,330
which is for me the very first time we

147
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:49,938
we had the thread enter that has

148
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,128
documented this red hint and it was

149
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,080
actually in the MIT and yeah they had a

150
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:57,020
problem with between the students that

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,659
were calling and the bill that they were

152
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,490
giving to the student was different from

153
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,409
the bill that to receive from AT&T and

154
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,810
they say okay so we have a problem where

155
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:07,819
I'm losing money and they track down all

156
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,490
the students that were exploiting

157
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:12,379
vulnerability in their systems to give

158
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,740
them the bill and it was a very first

159
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:18,169
intact we are the first n documented and

160
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,979
basically my talk today is about having

161
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:28,340
the good people with a good process to

162
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:32,258
find the bad guys okay and I don't cover

163
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:35,000
the last ten years but we went to broken

164
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:39,999
okay I guys you missed something a very

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,550
good talk a keynote that's that is just

166
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:46,490
reviewing the last ten years and so I

167
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:50,029
give you the the youtube link here so go

168
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:52,610
go there and check out so when I talk to

169
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:54,860
my friends at honest in the security

170
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,129
field I thought that that I'm kind of a

171
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,490
spider building my web trying to to have

172
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:03,740
my my web right and as soon as I have

173
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,620
one of the the string of my web that is

174
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,810
shaking I go out and check our what's

175
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,659
happening this is the the beautiful

176
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,960
picture but in reality it's more like

177
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,688
this so first we are more less after

178
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,818
spider because we are always

179
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:23,360
understaffed we have many many unknown

180
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,159
on our network we have yes so basically

181
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,029
when you reach this is I mean say yeah

182
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,589
probably it's doing like this you record

183
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:33,380
that so yeah probably it's working like

184
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:35,838
this but you don't right now and this is

185
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,299
what I see now from my MSSP standpoint

186
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,070
sir I really saw that people that will

187
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,439
contract our services there would be

188
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,930
like okay we never took think about

189
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,209
security and and we won't say you to

190
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,099
come and do the security but actually

191
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,010
there is many many companies that say oh

192
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,360
we tried and we end up with this results

193
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,269
but at the end of the day we don't know

194
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,720
how to do so could you please I'll pass

195
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:02,499
and and do the work for us and this to

196
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,619
come from this paper basically in a in

197
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:08,079
late me and honestly uh how can we have

198
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:09,999
something like this like you've lost

199
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,008
control of your seem like it's like a

200
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:14,470
car you lost control you are going to

201
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,839
the world and the I'm not changing the

202
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,610
paper the paper is really good but I

203
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,980
think it's a training in this industry

204
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,050
from one or two years we are more more

205
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,850
criticizing the scene and we have to

206
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,498
it's like this like you are no longer

207
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,540
being poisoned by your toxic fault

208
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,069
Oh after you get rid of that see me

209
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,469
sober for three years get running would

210
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:36,878
never offer you any value so it's one

211
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,230
one one to it but there is autism if you

212
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,709
go on Twitter you're gonna find many

213
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,149
many people criticizing the same or this

214
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,248
one this one is pretty interesting

215
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,619
because it starts to give them an answer

216
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:49,990
like organization elf Mike seemed

217
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:52,839
apparent fail who your same is all the

218
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:56,769
dead taken son answer well are you try

219
00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:00,429
using it what should I just deployed it

220
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,910
to and directly but now it's not that

221
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,449
easy

222
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:07,540
and my favorite tweets about seem is

223
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:10,779
this one plus one thousand point for the

224
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,269
rectum strong like far too many InfoSec

225
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,779
project security issues are first at

226
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:18,699
people and the process problem

227
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,379
technology is a decent sir I cannot

228
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:24,128
agree more so today we're going to talk

229
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:27,910
about the process and the people we and

230
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:30,399
the same and when it comes to process I

231
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:34,089
worked in a very very good company very

232
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,369
very good at process is Abbas having

233
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:40,990
appointed to be working on a fantastic

234
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:44,980
project s3 30 and basically what I've

235
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:48,220
done what I've been doing is fixing this

236
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,689
piece of the aircraft that is adding all

237
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,519
the connection between the wings and the

238
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:56,829
body and so I started my my day at 6

239
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,660
a.m. in the morning and I have my my

240
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:01,469
buzzard gave me like the paper and so ok

241
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,379
so today you're gonna screw 12 screws

242
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,059
okay so and what I do next

243
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,309
protect 20 minutes you know instead of

244
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:12,290
for your day so I was very skeptic

245
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:14,959
okay so the first point in the procedure

246
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,089
was scheduled to rise do you know how

247
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,858
many screws there is on a aircraft and

248
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:20,350
how many different screws there is on on

249
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:23,779
an aircraft

250
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:26,269
the answer is way too many we're way too

251
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:30,919
many and the problem is this part of the

252
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:32,869
aircraft here is very on the outside and

253
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,429
is is like a lot of strengths that is

254
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:36,169
going in all direction in this piece so

255
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,879
you need to to set it right because

256
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:41,569
otherwise if it girls during your flight

257
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:43,459
unit varies can have a P of that so you

258
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:45,259
get 2 2 right and then you have a

259
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,368
procedure for that and should be sure

260
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:48,999
that you have the right skills because

261
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:51,799
one millimeter can cause a disaster

262
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:54,169
then because you're gonna work on the on

263
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,269
the wing of the aircraft you get you to

264
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:59,119
prepare yourself and to be right some

265
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,529
are on the safety then you are being

266
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,720
controlled by your body so your butt is

267
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:04,489
busy on another part of the aircraft do

268
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,609
you ask him to come you check you you

269
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:11,269
can go then you screw your chuckles 20

270
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:14,779
minutes and then you ask you very to

271
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:18,290
control again to control again your your

272
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,569
your work and then at the end of the day

273
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,309
you need to chase the certification body

274
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,929
that is filling all the forms and saying

275
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,639
okay this aircraft is good for flying

276
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:27,709
because they have checked it completely

277
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:32,869
so basically at the end of the day it's

278
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:36,969
eight hours to cruise 12 screws but if

279
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:39,589
you look at if you want to to travel

280
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,329
they are reaching this very very very

281
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,759
low level and I think it's kind of

282
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:45,618
inspiration inspirational to say okay

283
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,839
this industry they have put so many

284
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:49,759
serving so many controls and at the end

285
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,039
of the day they they can claim that you

286
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,980
are the safest way to travel and it's

287
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:58,100
kind of interesting and I even read a

288
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,230
study that say if you eat peanuts drink

289
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,720
all the flights you will probably more

290
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,669
you have more luck to die because you

291
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,569
have diabetes then because you have

292
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:13,669
travel in the aircraft I don't know

293
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:15,769
let's take if it's true okay but I think

294
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,609
one of them the domain problems as I see

295
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,369
from our Agana

296
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:20,720
MSS with some principles that say oh we

297
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:22,940
need security we're gonna jump directly

298
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,900
to a security monitoring because

299
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:29,750
super-trendy is Baku but basically here

300
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,790
you have security monitoring but you

301
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,490
have five other controls before

302
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,079
according to CIS and if you don't start

303
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,340
to know what you have in your network if

304
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,090
you don't have your vulnerability

305
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:43,310
scanning if you don't manage your

306
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,320
administrators and you don't have a

307
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,479
secure configuration then I think you

308
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,580
you have some homework to do before

309
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,320
going for security monitoring and we've

310
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,240
seen so many so many companies come in

311
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,710
so please monitor my network I don't

312
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,630
know what is inside I don't know if it's

313
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,310
secured already but still monitor nephew

314
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,260
if you find something those looters I

315
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,030
think it's the wrong guy version if you

316
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,490
want to consider security monitoring

317
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:07,520
start first by doing your arm drop your

318
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:10,940
own work sorry and and get right the

319
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:17,720
fight first cas controls so let's assume

320
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:20,060
now sorry i want you to to reference a

321
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,790
very good tool to know where you are

322
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:26,140
against the cs controls it has been done

323
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,520
by security in cliff so it's very easy

324
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,080
excel fight you fill in your own sort of

325
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,240
questions and at the end you have a risk

326
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,430
or it's super well-made you have one for

327
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,800
managers non-technical and one for for

328
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,319
security professionals so let's assume

329
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:45,560
now we are right and we are rich Control

330
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:47,780
Number six whew Congrats so we start our

331
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,140
journey for security monitoring and I

332
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:53,750
have been lucky enough to study journey

333
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,610
with my with my current employer so yeah

334
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,000
we we know nothing about security

335
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:03,560
monitoring please start something

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,280
so I started what I go to pyramid of joy

337
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:10,130
so and I start to sliced all what I was

338
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,600
what I will do in the near future and I

339
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,310
start by saying okay so what we need

340
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,430
first is a platform platform to collect

341
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,619
all of our logs but it's not enough okay

342
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,439
so most companies start here like we

343
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,060
have the platform layer but what you

344
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,310
need is to have the device layer 2

345
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,319
device layer is the configuration and

346
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,239
the maintenance of all the device and be

347
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,470
sure that all your devices is talking to

348
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,850
your sim but it's not enough you will

349
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,110
have the data layer because your device

350
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,740
is talking to your sim but do you have

351
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,560
the right

352
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,380
that is interesting for you and at the

353
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,189
end only you have you the detection

354
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,410
layer which is all your your whole such

355
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,680
as getting a value out of your out of

356
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:54,319
your data and basically having this

357
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,939
approach it reserves a lot a lot a lot

358
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,250
of problem because every time we had a

359
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,670
problem say we're weights a second step

360
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,890
back

361
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,240
well the problem is coming from is it

362
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,680
coming from the detection layer data

363
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,610
layer diverse layer or platform layer

364
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,349
and then we apply that to choose three

365
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,110
broad category people process and

366
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,930
technology so we're gonna start with the

367
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,450
people so first what type of people you

368
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,979
need for detection layer for sure

369
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,290
security program because they will

370
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,260
create the detection but also they will

371
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,810
respond to the alarms to the security

372
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,670
incident you need to be curious because

373
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,800
they will create the the new detection

374
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,110
and you will rely on them pretty much

375
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,170
heavily for for the new threats and so

376
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,730
for the new techniques the second is a

377
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,439
data layer and I think it's the most

378
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,170
complicated layer because you need to go

379
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,870
outside of your sock and start to talk

380
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:47,750
to to all the all the manager of the

381
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,910
company to get your data so you need

382
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,070
somebody from the company probably if it

383
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,160
still exists ten years in the company

384
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,959
and start to say ok come in my team and

385
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,870
you will talk to people so that we can

386
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,209
get the data that we need and the device

387
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,910
layer it will work mostly on tickets but

388
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:08,300
you will have to know more less all all

389
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:11,959
the type of IT component that you can

390
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,730
have like network or systems and at the

391
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,400
end platform and job just like our sis

392
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,069
admin yeah and you will have all the

393
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,990
skills you need

394
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,879
so after depending of the budgets that

395
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,179
you gonna have you have like more or

396
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,829
less stuffs and what is this is

397
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,500
different scenarios that I I would

398
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:32,840
propose if you have two staffs I hoped

399
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,610
the secure channel is in the cyst season

400
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,770
mean and you circuit security analyst

401
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,260
take care of the detection area season

402
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,650
mean take care of the data device and

403
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,360
platform layer Swiss stuff tagged with

404
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,830
the data manager because one of the key

405
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,629
successor of a Security Operations

406
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,559
Center is to be able to talk to

407
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,600
everybody

408
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,999
to be to have the good connections I

409
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,789
think it's a very key person in your

410
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:59,029
sock first half double the security

411
00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:01,249
analyst five start to have a device

412
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:05,330
manager that will monitor permanently if

413
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:07,519
the device is talking to your sim six

414
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,100
more security analysts because pouring

415
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,889
more incidents seven snap I think you

416
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,230
reach them the level where actually you

417
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:17,809
need a second assignment because if one

418
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,320
goes on holidays then you want probably

419
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:24,769
to have somebody else to to back it

420
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,279
let's talk about process so we won't go

421
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:30,889
like like this uncommon this big pitches

422
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,480
but we're gonna slice it from the

423
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:34,158
detection layer the data layer the

424
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,470
device layer and the platform layer and

425
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:41,539
just this lady is about showing all the

426
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,159
connections and that all the connections

427
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:47,720
are integrated I will publish it on my

428
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:51,409
my get her back end right after the talk

429
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,799
with the presentation and also this this

430
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:58,369
image but we're gonna go quickly on the

431
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,049
the for the folios the first one the

432
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:03,019
first thing that you need is to allow

433
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:05,779
your your analyst to have time to go and

434
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:09,799
watch YouTube videos this cool this talk

435
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:11,440
is recorded Thank You Cooper and many

436
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,399
many talks are recorded by a security

437
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,559
enthusiastic so if you can allow them

438
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:17,600
like one hour two hours going to you to

439
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,749
watch videos it's a super cool job you

440
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,209
can watch video YouTube's doing your

441
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:26,419
working hours but then let them explore

442
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:29,749
all the new techniques could be Red Team

443
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:32,240
Blue Team and so this is the start of

444
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:34,519
your process you have a bright guys that

445
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,499
has a good idea the second way to start

446
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:41,210
the process is to have a business use

447
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:42,950
case and then the first thing that we

448
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,320
ask to our security analysts is to

449
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,690
record it even if it's just an ID okay

450
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,970
you go to the denies database you recall

451
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:53,480
your ID and then you don't lose track of

452
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,009
it then you look at the data do we have

453
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,860
already does that has that we need in

454
00:19:55,009 --> 00:20:00,559
the same if not trigger the other layer

455
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,059
and call the data layer honor and talk

456
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,480
to him say okay basically we need this

457
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,000
that

458
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,310
to make our detection work can you get

459
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,980
it yes no and then it's a kind of

460
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,620
feedback session between the two the two

461
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:17,150
analysts then you implement it in your

462
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,919
same and then with deformation you ask a

463
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,480
query to review from somebody else in

464
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,450
the team to be sure that the detection

465
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,310
is aligned with the objectives that you

466
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,190
have stage where when you are created

467
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:32,270
and started the process here you did the

468
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:35,840
final change and you communicate to all

469
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:39,950
the team then you move to operational

470
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,409
daily operations the reoperation is a

471
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,140
bit out of the scope of my talk but

472
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,850
still if you are interesting there is a

473
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,460
very very good book I do recommend

474
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,260
everyone to go and have a look of it

475
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,450
it's crafting the InfoSec play work it's

476
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,760
starting to be a bit old it's missing

477
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:59,180
the part where you need more controls

478
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,360
about your detection so the tools like

479
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,370
caldera and automated teaming I think

480
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,310
this is one part missing but still a

481
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,110
very good tool so then your whole of the

482
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,570
detection is thought to new when it's

483
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,120
only the ID you move to in progress when

484
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,679
you are older peer review deployed when

485
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,649
it's in production and I think what is

486
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,390
interesting is if it gets from being too

487
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,800
noisy not very aligned with the

488
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,900
objectives that they each state at the

489
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,690
beginning move it to a sign and the guys

490
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,100
are designed the rule has to fix it so

491
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,840
that you're not suffering from a lot a

492
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,060
lot of alarms that nobody cares about

493
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,820
but just you are sign it and you ask

494
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,790
people to fix it you can retire it if

495
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,409
it's very related to a campaign and say

496
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,810
okay we have this bench on fire see but

497
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,580
probably in one month it will be another

498
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,919
bunch of fire cease or retired the play

499
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,240
and add waypoints you cannot reject it

500
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,110
but you keep track of it for audit

501
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,810
perspective the data layer it's more

502
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:57,860
simple so we see that it started from

503
00:21:53,810 --> 00:22:00,770
the ozone layer which is the detection

504
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,840
layer and you have this peer review it's

505
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:05,330
kind of important because your

506
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:09,709
determination here your data manager you

507
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:14,179
will know exactly what my data is inside

508
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:16,070
then I think whatever the most difficult

509
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,470
job is to standardize and to level

510
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,510
of all your data because if one of your

511
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,820
and I say okay I gonna work on failed

512
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:25,190
logins but what is fail logins for

513
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:29,510
Windows system what is a fail lookin for

514
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:32,030
a web application firewall so it's every

515
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:34,700
time different type of vlogs but you

516
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:38,300
need to standardize it and and and level

517
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,740
it properly then very key having

518
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,200
everything documented in the knowledge

519
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,790
base so that's you can easily push it

520
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,740
directly to the acetone out save

521
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:48,440
basically if you are the windows that

522
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:51,050
mean this is what we need to make our

523
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,310
detection work and also you can push it

524
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,080
to the to your control

525
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:57,590
number Five's that should be already

526
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,629
implemented and to say ok please check

527
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:03,100
that the configuration is correct for

528
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,300
our detection to work and then you have

529
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:09,199
this connection to the bottom layer

530
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:11,330
which is device so every time you scan

531
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,300
and you find a new asset you can have a

532
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,449
PV view with with the Data Manager say

533
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,919
ok do we know already that we have this

534
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,330
technology in place do we have the data

535
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,490
for that yes or no

536
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,530
initially we put it directly here but

537
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:27,320
then we kind of start to discover shadow

538
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,750
IT and then you don't want your data

539
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,000
manager to start vm spending time

540
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:36,290
instances that will be shut down in a

541
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,240
question of weeks process layer so here

542
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,250
C is number one and to a certain

543
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,980
software inventory you prioritize your

544
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,020
assets you have a strong procedure about

545
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,890
unloading and avoiding your devices and

546
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,870
then you your human so that is always

547
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,670
talking to your sim and also push

548
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,229
triggers the secure configuration if you

549
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:57,440
see that some data is missing from your

550
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,690
devices finally the platform in string

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,260
has an access to this layer to say for

552
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,910
any let's say too noisy devices that put

553
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,370
at risk your platform you can say please

554
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,960
of garlic

555
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:11,090
finally the platform layer I got a very

556
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,920
quickly on this because it's it's where

557
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,070
everybody succeeds initial installation

558
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,540
you monitor their else and the of your

559
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,280
platform you have the change management

560
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,850
incident management and it's pretty

561
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,889
basic IT just in case of a very noisy

562
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:28,159
device or not responding device just

563
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:32,880
talk to the to the device layer

564
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,190
finally the technology um basically the

565
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,170
technology I think if you have a bunch

566
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,000
of money this is not where you should

567
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:41,490
spend too much money but among the

568
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,100
people level and ask for more stuff than

569
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,500
fortunes because honestly you can do

570
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,409
many many things for not that many that

571
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,890
much on your system you can deploy bit

572
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,510
were su OS query please collide feet it

573
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,930
will money tells you or your end point

574
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:00,629
and all type of service or network you

575
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:05,400
can have Civic attic or snow or snot and

576
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:09,480
even open open firewall e if you need it

577
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,430
you put everything in in an elastic and

578
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,800
luck / database which is a kind of

579
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:20,520
splint but cheaper is which is which is

580
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:23,639
not not difficult or gridlock Gregg is

581
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,460
free and still five gigabytes 50

582
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,990
gigabytes per day Avenue knowledge

583
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,640
database super important you can use

584
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,800
media Mickey it works well because it's

585
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,300
super scalable and also as soon as you

586
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,990
bring somebody in your team in a so it

587
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:39,510
works its Wikipedia presentation system

588
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:43,470
well I got this a visitor on on-boarded

589
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:45,780
but if you use the LSD stack you can use

590
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,370
Cabana and then you need a ticketing and

591
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:51,120
a case management system and you know

592
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:55,560
anyone knows very good case management

593
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:58,979
system the I've sorry I saw there was

594
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:01,080
some French here so yeah I'll try again

595
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:06,540
so a very good sweat intelligence

596
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:08,070
platform for free miss thank you yeah

597
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,409
and you have your miss platform and

598
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:13,020
basically if you have this it would cost

599
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:16,500
you a lot so this is the end of my talk

600
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,389
just it's a process it works for us

601
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,880
doesn't mean it will work for you but

602
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,460
it's just if you have problems applied

603
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,500
the pyramid strategy I think is the best

604
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,310
way to solve your problems try the

605
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,800
process

606
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,629
implements its try if it's work right

607
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,950
your procedure and if doesn't fraudsters

608
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:37,170
change it and just to conclude this this

609
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,660
talk I'm not very good at conclusion sir

610
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,220
I just say like far too mean for sex

611
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,100
projects most security issues

612
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,540
first people and process problem

613
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:53,928
technology is a distant third thank you

614
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:57,389
[Applause]

615
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:59,130
okay so there is there any question so

616
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:02,159
as I explained during the introduction

617
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,100
we have 15 minutes we asked a different

618
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:16,289
speaker to reserve 15 minutes to have

619
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:17,809
interaction with the audience good

620
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:21,710
morning

621
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:24,570
all right first a quick feedback note

622
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,919
unwelcome or welcome I don't know the

623
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,020
last ten minutes of this presentation

624
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,169
were approaching valuable to me the

625
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,780
first part of it was totally I could

626
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:35,610
have stayed in bed sorry the last part

627
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:39,240
of last 10 minutes where we got into

628
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:43,229
actual shock and sim talks and and

629
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,150
content was getting almost relevant

630
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,309
especially the last slide with the

631
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:53,010
different tools is interesting and we

632
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:57,110
can debate that you skipped on the slide

633
00:27:53,010 --> 00:28:06,320
before that or the slide before that for

634
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:09,780
go back a step and one more and one more

635
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,730
that one on this one you have device

636
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,110
on-boarding and off-boarding but you on

637
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,659
the next slide you had change management

638
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,820
and this one you don't and then this one

639
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,570
you skip the concept of cloud and self

640
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,490
provisioning or to provisioning entirely

641
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,939
please comment on change management in

642
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:29,039
the context of this slide and on cloud

643
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,120
okay so for your first remark so you

644
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,549
know that time for the very first

645
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,789
picking of the day and when I designed

646
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:37,350
this talk and say ok probably people

647
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,900
will be late I mean because I'm coming

648
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,689
from Spain and people don't survive at

649
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,390
time so if I put directly interesting

650
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,610
topics at the very beginning then

651
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,740
probably people that arrive late they

652
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,969
will miss the interesting things so it's

653
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,450
always difficult to be the first speaker

654
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,400
of the day because you don't know

655
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,320
if the the room and people will be here

656
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,590
people will take will be taking coffee

657
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,970
so but honestly it has been well managed

658
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,990
by the gay because we are all on time

659
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:09,270
but I cannot break that so indeed it's

660
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,070
it's on purpose that I spent time and

661
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,050
doing history as things that's probably

662
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:17,639
you already know then the question about

663
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:22,290
change management here so either for me

664
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:24,960
to change management's you do it here ok

665
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:27,780
so because you are pushing your your new

666
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,460
configurations to to the asset owners

667
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,030
and then the asset owners has the

668
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,950
responsibility to implement the right

669
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,800
settings to get the information that you

670
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:41,790
are that you need it's a problem of of

671
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:45,500
this Tim okay and for the cloud I think

672
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:48,540
doesn't free change am anything because

673
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:52,440
you're here at the beginning of the

674
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:54,960
process oh sorry wrong direction at the

675
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,410
beginning of the process when you scan

676
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,900
you can also scan us scan your your

677
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:05,910
cloud and see if there is any new assets

678
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:09,600
any new sorry I didn't get right here

679
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,250
your question but every time you

680
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,219
provision something you're gonna be

681
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:16,980
built for so basically you can also look

682
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,320
at how much you're built and see what is

683
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,450
in the system and I think if something

684
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,179
is not labeled or you don't know what it

685
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:27,270
is then it's a unit take action on it

686
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,250
the challenge is once you start using

687
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:32,700
cloud systems that can auto provision

688
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,170
scale up scale down then how do you do

689
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,910
configuration management how do you have

690
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,260
that single asset repository will

691
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,420
up-to-date information on every asset

692
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,060
you have even if you ought to scan it

693
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,420
will be out of date or wrong within

694
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,590
minutes even seconds how do you do some

695
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,030
kind of vulnerability scanning do you

696
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,100
even need to do vulnerability scanning

697
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,990
on a server that is provisioned and

698
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,300
maybe runs 24 hours and then it's gone

699
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,550
forever after and these are really

700
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,730
important questions at least to me in

701
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:03,710
the context of your presentations yeah

702
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,710
so far will it be the management's I

703
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,750
think

704
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:14,170
I mean you can scan the depending of

705
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:17,300
what you have defined as the right

706
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,460
interval between your scans but I ended

707
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,220
it it's a problem I'm not challenging

708
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,770
that and I it's difficult to do but for

709
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:29,510
for Asset Management's I do think that

710
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:31,879
even if you are in the cloud you do have

711
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,070
one advantage is that you're going to be

712
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,830
built for the assets every time you

713
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,720
start in you a new a new server in the

714
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,310
cloud you will be built for it so you

715
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,800
can wait the end of the month until it's

716
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:45,470
one month but you will know exactly what

717
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,090
you have and the second point is yet

718
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,400
there is one disadvantage there you

719
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,050
don't have any gatekeeper because

720
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,670
everybody that doesn't mean access to

721
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:58,580
your cloud can set up at any point of

722
00:31:52,670 --> 00:32:01,640
time and you a new a new server and in

723
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,649
this case it's a kind of process and be

724
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,410
sure that people follows this process to

725
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,630
to be aware that any new server will be

726
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:12,530
will be recorded and you will be in form

727
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:14,390
of that and I don't think that you have

728
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:20,080
very convinced well it's very good

729
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:20,080
question and I can talk more about it

730
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:28,100
hello so I really appreciated your

731
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:31,010
torque on on the other end because I

732
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,379
started my first job as a steam engineer

733
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,660
in in the bank at like Slovakia and

734
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,000
people told me ok you need to implement

735
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:41,360
the sim but I had no process to start

736
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,130
with so you here trying to think ok in

737
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,810
term of technology which technol I

738
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,520
choose and so on and you forget the most

739
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,310
important aspect which is the people

740
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:52,010
because integrated seem is speaking to

741
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,620
all the different team in IT deciding

742
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,930
how will you keep the log share the

743
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,830
rocket because it can be interesting for

744
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:03,890
other teams and I think in our in up and

745
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,570
for for us for this feedback we worked

746
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,900
to engineer working on this project I

747
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,790
was working only on the process and

748
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,710
people and my other colleague was

749
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,870
working on technology aspects that is to

750
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,670
say what is fully important so that's

751
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,739
why I think and meant back then I was I

752
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,990
would have really appreciated talk

753
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,960
to detail the step and I hope that you

754
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,970
put it online but then only aspect is I

755
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,040
think it's big a lot about the process

756
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,740
but the real difficult aspect is really

757
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:35,149
to go to the gym to sell your projects

758
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:37,490
to see immigrants is a point and to make

759
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,900
them buy the project and I think that's

760
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,470
enough Dakota's missing in your

761
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,210
presentation but overall I like the

762
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:47,020
procedure to detail thank you very much

763
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:49,460
for the good feedback in it and I think

764
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:53,090
probably everybody explains it

765
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,000
we are in a job that is so so political

766
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:58,070
and I think it's something that we need

767
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,860
to change as an industry completely and

768
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,230
we need to get rid of all these kitchens

769
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,709
our start of with because of the Acker

770
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:10,190
uh because it's bad or just saying no to

771
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:12,830
projects and more to Twitter so here I

772
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:14,540
understand what you what you want to do

773
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,330
what you want to achieve

774
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:20,179
I am breast completely the the goal of

775
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:22,040
the of the company but I just want to

776
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:24,259
give you like good practice guidelines

777
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,870
and we can work together and you can

778
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,370
challenge us and we probably and then

779
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:31,069
the objective for you is to get like

780
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:33,319
your 80% so really what you want to be

781
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,330
achieve and let down like 20 persons

782
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,940
sets will make the difference between

783
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:40,219
thing that this security team in the

784
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,740
corner that is all I think no and we

785
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:43,759
don't want to talk to them to somebody

786
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,799
like yeah

787
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:51,220
you will be inside the team and consider

788
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,220
as as a somebody that is adding value

789
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,050
thank you for for a nice time what

790
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:04,549
no more question I also like it and for

791
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,530
me when one key aspect is the data layer

792
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:10,950
because it's something that you know we

793
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:16,079
often say your system is as good as the

794
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:18,868
data you put in it and for me it still

795
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,250
we are in another loop because if you

796
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,950
take the last slide with all those

797
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:27,540
technologies we have this issue of data

798
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:29,669
quality at every single tool like miss

799
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,980
piece a great platform but if someone

800
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:34,290
put eight eight eight eight in your East

801
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,760
even then your theme is going to go

802
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:41,640
crazy and trust me it happens a lot we

803
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,040
got in our everyday job like Microsoft

804
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,578
comm google.de eight eight eight eight

805
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,440
in events they are pushed and so what

806
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,050
would you do to avoid that kind of issue

807
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,420
yeah so I didn't talk too much about

808
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:58,200
certain Terry Johnson and go into detail

809
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,190
but what I think and I think miss B's

810
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:05,098
grateful for that you need to have

811
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:07,560
communities at different levels here if

812
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,480
you build a trusted communities and you

813
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,880
know personally the people and you can

814
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,190
go and say yeah I know this analyst push

815
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,319
this I can trust it 100% and you have

816
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,000
like this top community and you don't

817
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,220
check anything and you push it directly

818
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,920
to the same because you have built this

819
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,770
community with companies that are

820
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,380
similar to use and behaving the same

821
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,599
type of industry and then you can trust

822
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,280
it and push it directly for others that

823
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,020
you don't know it's open source it's

824
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,450
somebody in the other side of the

825
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,390
planets then there is always a quality

826
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:41,098
review and it's more used for incident

827
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,819
response and clearing the the cert

828
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:54,390
Intelligence Platform then for doing

829
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:56,009
data enrichment more water just an

830
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,779
SPECT I will add these when I was

831
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,240
implementing the seam and so we hit that

832
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:02,460
on on our enough team but at some point

833
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,509
somebody say hey did you check as a

834
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,369
walking concern so sandy get the company

835
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,930
because they may react something to say

836
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:11,730
because you're collecting data from zero

837
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,129
employees well and after one year of

838
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,230
development people were saying yeah we

839
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,450
need to take care of PII so personal

840
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,849
didn't see fire information so you know

841
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,950
the name custom and so on so four people

842
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:24,960
will not complain that you know when we

843
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,058
login of the machine basically and back

844
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,059
then get the feedback saying okay you

845
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:33,089
need to remove every IP from your sim

846
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:35,700
and yeah and that was clear and it has

847
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:36,990
to be done so yeah just saying that was

848
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,569
service aspect is important because

849
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:42,598
maybe to enter this plan technically but

850
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:44,369
develop architecture where to for every

851
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,500
component we are we have to send the

852
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:48,720
actual version of the IP the real

853
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,220
version and to set up an alarm but if

854
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,019
someone connects to this seam of the

855
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,640
real IP you should allow the security

856
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,919
team but just to serve as a regulation

857
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,930
and the people within the company our so

858
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,700
you just rigueur to go increment the sim

859
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,460
so to say that this technology's really

860
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,769
see a spot its release everything which

861
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,500
is the wrong which is if you could get

862
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:11,399
yeah and from the legal perspective I

863
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:14,430
think then yeah we need to get out of

864
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,869
all the emotional expect oh we are there

865
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,180
is a sim now in the company so I am

866
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:19,980
being spied and so that's a new

867
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,890
procedure and your process there is very

868
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:27,059
strict guidelines that respect the law

869
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:31,640
and if there is still problems you can

870
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:34,049
just mask and replace the value by

871
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,940
something else and this is what also

872
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:39,150
what we do in the cloud so you avoid to

873
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:44,210
you just swap the data by another one

874
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,210
but we are still able to to recover

875
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:55,089
thanks for sharing that that was us as

876
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:57,979
fantastic as GDP are acquiring and the

877
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:59,029
Whois databases to stop showing the

878
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:02,779
email addresses of the people

879
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:04,940
registering domains it's something that

880
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:09,229
when implemented actually hurts security

881
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:12,619
for any company or any researcher and in

882
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:14,899
the context of GDP are I would not

883
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,130
recommend from my personal experience

884
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,529
and everything I've been reading and I

885
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,089
read a lot that you actually go ahead

886
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:21,680
and remove the eyepiece instead if

887
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:24,170
you're talking to lawyers in a situation

888
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,019
like this go with all the other ways

889
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:28,880
that gdpr has for you to get approval to

890
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:30,558
do this because you need IPS and your

891
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,529
sim how are you going to correlate

892
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,029
anything with your perimeter devices if

893
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:37,910
you don't have IP addresses what what

894
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:39,499
use is a forward or reverse proxy if you

895
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,899
don't have the IP addresses you will be

896
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:44,808
stuck stuck and stuck multiple times

897
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:49,670
throughout the subprocesses if you don't

898
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:52,489
have the IPS so gdpr gives you ways to

899
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,890
do this if you have a valid business

900
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:57,140
reason contract your contract your base

901
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:59,359
consent you can go ahead and you can

902
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,069
stall of this you can even like get some

903
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,109
kind of security clearance for your suc

904
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:04,449
operators the system administrators who

905
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,828
can log onto the server as well and

906
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:10,279
there's so many ways to get approval for

907
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:12,619
storing some kind of PII that I would

908
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:14,539
definitely pursue instead of just giving

909
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:18,430
in to some lawyer and telling him okay

910
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:18,430
we'll remove IP addresses and use a hash

911
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:24,578
thank you
