1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,200
stage is yours thank you very much the

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,540
good thing about having trouble with

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,329
technology when setting up is you look

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,090
like a fool from the beginnin and you

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,580
can do whatever you want afterwards so

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:24,519
my talk is about weaponizing lay eight

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:26,769
and it's all about getting the best for

8
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,948
your users and for your company security

9
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:32,949
wise so as you're probably all Niall

10
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:37,420
know we in the industry used to call

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:39,730
users idiots the weakest link and all

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,640
the kind of names that are really not

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,669
very nice to describe the funny antics

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,350
and their stupidity when they are on our

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,590
networks dealing with our services and

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,410
services service and services I think

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,320
it's really time to overhaul that kind

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,830
of thinking because it's destructive and

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,230
so I think this talk is relevant because

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:05,770
you could of course go to any vendor

21
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:08,499
specific event buy a lot of cyber dark

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:11,259
chain block boxes whatever put them in

23
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:13,929
your network and have machine after

24
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:16,899
machine after machine each one with a

25
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:19,869
little nice dashboard for your sock team

26
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:24,039
and with lots of information on there

27
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:26,469
that nobody really is going to read so

28
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:29,469
at the end I don't think that your users

29
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:30,759
are a problem I think your users are not

30
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:34,770
your weakest link

31
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,060
but humans matter and you can get your

32
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,490
users and the people working at your

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,329
company to actually help you increase

34
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,229
security

35
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:46,089
so we tried that in former times by just

36
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,039
telling them they have to increase

37
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,009
security and that obviously didn't work

38
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:54,039
so I tried to come up with Brian fight

39
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:57,779
who did the talk with me for the first

40
00:01:54,039 --> 00:02:02,679
time with a few ideas how we can do that

41
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:05,439
but another thing I have been told that

42
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:07,959
if I give a talk next year I have to pay

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:12,189
money each time I say cyber this year

44
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:14,140
it's free cyber cyber cyber so I'm using

45
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,609
that word for a specific reason and that

46
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,459
is because

47
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,310
the users and the people dealing with

48
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,230
InfoSec are calling it cyber a lot of us

49
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,480
in the industry don't like the word and

50
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,100
I know that I respect that but our

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,829
clients and the people at the end of the

52
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,250
day paying us use the word so why not go

53
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,180
with it

54
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:37,090
it's an uphill battle so how does cyber

55
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,370
impact the physical domain you may have

56
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,980
heard or may not have heard about the

57
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,200
problems to get a good pizza why a

58
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,739
delivery service in Germany last year

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,200
and the year before because there are

60
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,930
many different platforms offering fast

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,320
food and home delivery and those

62
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,360
platforms aplomb at prime times

63
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,630
allegedly ddosed each other so that they

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,070
could get the traffic but on the other

65
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,970
hand that means you couldn't get online

66
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,620
and order pizza so the whole system went

67
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,500
down just because the platforms were

68
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,200
battling each other and on a slightly

69
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,240
more serious note wanna cry of course is

70
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,799
something that affected a lot of

71
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:24,700
hospitals and cost a lot of not just

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:30,400
money but health wise it was a really

73
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:33,130
horror scenario and thanks to a guy

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,620
called Barton Finch I know about

75
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:40,150
swatting does anybody of you know what

76
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:42,700
swatting is yeah I just still like to

77
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,650
explain it if swatting is if I call the

78
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,630
police and somebody else and report a

79
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,630
while and crime it's very often a

80
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:52,090
violent crime like a homicide like sight

81
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,700
like murder like something really really

82
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:59,739
bad going on the police shows up at the

83
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:03,579
house of somebody and then stuff happens

84
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:06,340
in that case two guys had a struggle

85
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,800
over an online go game called call of

86
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,660
duty and I think it was the trade of

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,200
some weapon skin and a handful of

88
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,690
dollars so that struggle got out of hand

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,159
and one guy

90
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:23,350
Finch said Tyler Berra said I'm going to

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,930
SWAT you and the other guy said well I

92
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:29,889
dare you and gave him an address

93
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,750
it just wasn't his address so the first

94
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,539
guy called the police reported a while

95
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:41,289
in crime they showed up at a house of a

96
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:43,360
guy called and Andrew Finch and Andrew

97
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,180
Finch opened the door and stared at

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,259
several heavily armed guards and police

99
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,240
man pointing weapons at him so no idea

100
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,850
what went through his head but he wanted

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,520
to scratch his ass so whether you hide a

102
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,110
weapon if you open the door and have a

103
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,258
while and crime going on and you're the

104
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,300
perp you're the guy doing it probably at

105
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,490
your waistband so police shot him dead

106
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,780
and he was completely innocent in that

107
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:13,870
so this is the kind of weaponizing layer

108
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,210
8 that I'm not proposing because it's

109
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,020
completely the opposite of I want to do

110
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:22,508
but we can safely say that cyber does

111
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,330
impact the physical domain whether we

112
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:27,070
want to acknowledge that or not but even

113
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,080
people like with a pizza delivery

114
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,780
service who are not really online and

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,389
who are not used to be being online are

116
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,799
affected by what goes on in in the

117
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:41,560
internet how can we change that this

118
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,430
talk is all about empowering users about

119
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,169
giving them an option not about

120
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,849
threatening them with consequences if

121
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,770
they don't follow security because that

122
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,229
obviously doesn't work it doesn't really

123
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,840
work well with us either because I think

124
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,840
it's in human nature that if somebody

125
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,479
really tells you you must not do this

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,638
then even if you never have the idea to

127
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,699
do this you think about doing this

128
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,520
whatever this is so I'd like to start

129
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:13,090
with an example how to do over USB

130
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,948
sticks you probably all are familiar

131
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,659
with the cliche that a pen tester who

132
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,210
wants to break into a company just

133
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:22,030
leaves a few you see sticks thumb drives

134
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,239
lying around with malware and employees

135
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,698
put them into the network and open a

136
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,970
back door for you it's not just a cliche

137
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:34,150
I think it works and there were studies

138
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,099
by the University of Minnesota and

139
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,229
others where they found out that

140
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:39,139
approximately half of the sticks have

141
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,479
been put in

142
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:45,060
that have been found how do you get

143
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,550
people to plug a USB stick in you appeal

144
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,680
to different emotions for example if

145
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,780
it's not just the stick but the stick

146
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,520
with a pair of keys and a nice little

147
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,219
teddy bear and the stick maybe is in

148
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,580
pink one of your co-workers might think

149
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,960
hey that could belong to a colleague

150
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,030
let's plug it in and see who it is maybe

151
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,419
there's a photo on or something like

152
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:08,880
that so that I can return it or you

153
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:13,039
appeal to greet you just label the stick

154
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,840
Bitcoin wallet or you appeal to

155
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,060
curiosity by saying this are our

156
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,340
finances for the current year something

157
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,070
like that people will plug it in

158
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,469
somewhere and to be honest and I don't

159
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:28,590
need a show of hands here if you found a

160
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,970
USB stick that looks suspicious so you

161
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,739
would hand it over and you wouldn't be

162
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,169
interested what's on there and try to

163
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,410
analyze it we are plugging and USB

164
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:43,639
sticks that we find so how do we expect

165
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:46,169
our users not sure so what we did and

166
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:50,280
disclaimer we didn't do that to foil

167
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:52,380
that pen testers and criminals plan we

168
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,409
built something that is a wire start in

169
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,570
detention station the way it works this

170
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,950
you've gotta use we stick with data on

171
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:05,010
it you go up there you authorize

172
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,050
yourself move your smart card plug in

173
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,560
the stick select the files you want to

174
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,169
have at your office PC and then when you

175
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,880
return to your office PC they will be

176
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:19,380
there will be a link in your inbox to

177
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:23,240
those files we didn't do that to follow

178
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,590
the plans of someone as I've said but

179
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,599
gather around the fire because I'm going

180
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:31,830
to tell you a tale of a really

181
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:34,588
unnecessarily complicated process the

182
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,299
way our company works we are really old

183
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:39,300
company we've been around for 50 years

184
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:43,620
and so some things are a little bit

185
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:45,390
strange if you had something like a

186
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,089
presentation like this one and you

187
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:51,689
wanted to work on it and I brought my

188
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:55,290
USB stick into the office I

189
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,420
be able to use it I need a USB stick

190
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,060
that the company gave me I put the

191
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,060
presentation on there then I would put

192
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,989
it in an envelope that envelope get gets

193
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:10,979
delivered by in-house Postal Service to

194
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,870
different building and then they're some

195
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,020
kind of magic would happen they would

196
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,170
scan it and they would even put a seal

197
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,600
over the cap of the USB stick to tell me

198
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,760
that it has been scanned and then it

199
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,060
went back why are the internal posting

200
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,920
services to my desk just a rough

201
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,180
estimation how long do you think this

202
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:37,469
whole process takes 50 years old company

203
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,010
so yeah one week is a good estimate

204
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,470
it was between four or five working days

205
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,550
so what does the do if you try to do a

206
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,890
chyle

207
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:52,609
and all the other buzzwords if you try

208
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:55,830
to do something very quick yeah

209
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,900
something like that what actually

210
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,510
happens is of course that users would

211
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,130
plug in the sticks regardless of whether

212
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,160
they have been scanned by the internal

213
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,950
department or not because basically they

214
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,040
want to work and I think whenever we

215
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:14,430
have things in place that stop our users

216
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,480
from doing whatever they need to do they

217
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:20,459
will find creative ways around it so we

218
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,650
found out that with a wireless detention

219
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,330
station this is something where somebody

220
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,459
can even bring their private sticks

221
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,900
because it doesn't matter or a stick

222
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,070
they found out the parking lot because

223
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:35,370
again it doesn't matter plug them in and

224
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:37,020
those files are the detention station

225
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,300
isn't a part of the network that is far

226
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,220
far away from the office network so on

227
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,939
the way to the office network those

228
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,890
files it hashed get scanned and all

229
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,720
kinds of security happens before you get

230
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,790
the link to the files in the Inbox and

231
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,440
if it's malicious of course you don't

232
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,569
get a link to the fire to the file on

233
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,320
the inbox it just says you know we

234
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:01,410
couldn't deliver this these files it

235
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,900
made us more secure and at the same time

236
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,020
it's much much more convenient to our

237
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,819
users it

238
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,189
usually depending on the file size of

239
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:13,300
course but you've got the link within

240
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:16,930
minutes not within days another thing I

241
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:22,900
think we need to we need to think about

242
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:24,849
is the whole fishing thing so again you

243
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,800
people in this room you know about

244
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:31,300
malicious links you know how to spot

245
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:34,420
them and we tried and by we I also mean

246
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,609
our company to tell our users what to

247
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,589
look for and what among maliciously and

248
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,340
linked looks like and so on and so on

249
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:43,840
and nowadays it gets terribly difficult

250
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,140
to find out whether the link is

251
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,090
malicious or not I can tell you that for

252
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,410
the first one and for any kind of link

253
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:55,060
shortener it's going to be impossible

254
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,819
except you follow the link and see what

255
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,310
it results to and the second one with

256
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,830
the Amazon with a zero for the oh that's

257
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,540
actually a channel in Amazon link well

258
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,510
they bought it probably because of these

259
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:12,579
reasons but it's changed and you can't

260
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:16,960
be too sure so Ryan came up with a term

261
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:20,560
indicator of all and I think it's a

262
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,020
very good method that we can teach our

263
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,900
users that we don't really teach them

264
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,699
how to spot links but we teach them to

265
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,740
look for indicators of and if

266
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,260
there's at least one two or three of

267
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,770
them in an email they can safely discard

268
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,200
it so what are indicators of

269
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:40,660
well the first one should be obvious

270
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,970
some people who said spam want to make

271
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,459
money so money is always somehow

272
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,440
involved whether it's the Nigerian

273
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,590
prince who really really wants to give

274
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,900
you a few millions or anything else

275
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,120
money is always some kind of thing

276
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,040
whether you should buy things or whether

277
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,270
it's some kind of threat we're fishing

278
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,599
like hey we notice that you are late on

279
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:08,890
account fees pay eighty euros now or pay

280
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:12,040
1000 later money somehow is very often

281
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:14,770
involved and another thing that is very

282
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,740
often involved are threats maybe they

283
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,730
are a little bit hidden or maybe they

284
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,209
are very obvious

285
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:25,120
but again with an example pay now and

286
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:28,959
for small fee or you have to pay a lot

287
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:33,899
later that is a threat or what have you

288
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:39,040
you know the whole spectrum of threats

289
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:40,630
be we will we will make your pictures

290
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,550
public if you don't don't pay us now

291
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,399
that would be an obvious threat and

292
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,170
things like that if you get a business

293
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,630
email and if you think about all the

294
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,689
letter too many emails you get at home

295
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:56,079
and in your business how often do you

296
00:13:52,690 --> 00:14:01,389
have threats not that often I presume so

297
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:03,969
that is something to be wary of and the

298
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:08,440
next thing and I lose I use the term

299
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:12,310
very loosely is of course Romans so from

300
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,949
the sexy Russian young girl I'm being

301
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:18,310
stereotypic but all the spam I get is

302
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:20,139
Russian or Russian girls from the sexy

303
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,380
young Russian girl that really really

304
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:26,250
wants to make your acquaintance and fell

305
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,889
so in love with you by discovering you

306
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,449
at some service I never subscribe to

307
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:34,300
Romans is very often involved in emails

308
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:37,569
as well so if you at your workplace and

309
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,599
somebody sends your mail like that it's

310
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:42,610
a little bit uncommon it's like somebody

311
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,560
would send your love letter without

312
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,170
knowing you so again this is an

313
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,779
indicator and the next and I think this

314
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:53,589
is one of the most interesting ones is

315
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:55,510
urgency because you know if we force our

316
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,949
brain to make a decision really really

317
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,149
quickly

318
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:03,699
then some of our ratio just shuts down

319
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:07,870
we are not as humans thinking that

320
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:10,930
straight and urgency a sin I refer to

321
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:14,829
the first example again as in pay

322
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:17,500
something now or pay 10 times 100 times

323
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:20,229
the money in three days there's a sense

324
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
of urgency and I think ok um might be a

325
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,170
scam but maybe I should do it any of

326
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,319
these indicators shows that probably

327
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:32,560
this email is not genuine but with

328
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:35,410
emails we have one more thing

329
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,819
we taught our users to click things if

330
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,389
you look at the internet at the World

331
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:40,479
Wide Web

332
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:43,629
this is just it lifts from clicking on

333
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,060
links on buttons on something so

334
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:49,360
basically we have slightly trained our

335
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,758
users to click on things and the site

336
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,519
psychological craving to click on

337
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,730
something if there is something to click

338
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,860
like with an email and phishing link I

339
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:02,079
haven't found any kind of study from any

340
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,149
University I would love to do something

341
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,609
like that but I just know from

342
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:09,399
experience you some people want to click

343
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,680
something so we provided them with a

344
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,920
button that just says report this email

345
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,719
and this button for what's the email to

346
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,029
the sock or any kind of relevant team

347
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,459
they have a look at it and they come

348
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:23,620
back with either this mail is genuine

349
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:25,839
its just spam or this mail is genuine

350
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,230
you can whatever you want with it or

351
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,230
they have all the data they need to feed

352
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,300
the spam filters and to make sure this

353
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,709
kind of fishing link or this kind of

354
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:41,649
mail doesn't doesn't come in to anybody

355
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:44,079
else's inbox so the craving for the

356
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,959
click is there because you can click the

357
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,000
form of this mail and I think I'm not

358
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,099
completely wrong that because every

359
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,689
social engineering platform I had a look

360
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,059
at that do fishing campaigns

361
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,910
anti-phishing campaigns have this kind

362
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:01,240
of service exactly for that reason

363
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:03,910
and then of course we can not only

364
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,040
recognize how our users why not

365
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,129
weaponize the attackers as well why not

366
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,459
try reverse social engineering with

367
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:16,089
those guys we deserve it

368
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:19,959
have you heard about CEO fraud generally

369
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:22,929
so CEO fraud is nothing technical it's

370
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,490
just an attempt to embezzle a lot of

371
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,680
money from your company and it works

372
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,720
like that

373
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,820
somebody poses as the CEO of your

374
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,030
company in an email and sends an email

375
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,950
to someone working finances not the

376
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,420
highest level up but somebody who has

377
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,410
the ability to send a lot of money and

378
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,130
it goes like this

379
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,930
the mayor says hi I'm you CEO I'm

380
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,720
currently in country X we are thinking

381
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:52,720
about buying this company there do we

382
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,100
have 20 million that you could transfer

383
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,320
to and it sounds completely stupid and

384
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,219
probably if you think how can you

385
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,600
possibly fall for that but thing is it's

386
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,270
a little bit more complicated than that

387
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,639
because there's always again urgency and

388
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,320
something like your boss told me you are

389
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,930
the employee to talk to because you're

390
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,840
the most reliable one but please keep

391
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:19,090
keep your mouth shut about that and so

392
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,090
on and so forth and then the money gets

393
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,429
transferred well it's not a useless

394
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,800
point because there's a company in

395
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,660
Nuremberg and paid 40 million with a

396
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,700
scam like that and if you think that

397
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,370
your company is secure Facebook and

398
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,300
Google paid a combined 100 million to

399
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,489
scams like that

400
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,430
so these happen these are not that

401
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:42,760
technical but how do you protect against

402
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,260
that another company Nuremberg that I

403
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,410
really did something I really really

404
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:50,110
like because they had low C or fraud

405
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:52,960
emails so often they came up with a

406
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,330
beautiful process they told all the

407
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,610
users in fact the CEO told all their

408
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,669
users that he would never send such an

409
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:04,179
email that's the first thing you can do

410
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:05,770
yes well and if they received such an

411
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,440
email they should forward it to the

412
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:11,440
stock and a special team they would

413
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,659
alter the email address ever so slightly

414
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,909
come back to the attacker saying oh see

415
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:18,460
oh yeah thank you of course we can do

416
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:20,830
that but actually I don't have the

417
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,600
limits that you need but you do have

418
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,449
them and you probably have forgotten

419
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,759
about the new shiny payment portal we

420
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,299
set up for you and of course it's an

421
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,889
attack yeah yeah and then they would

422
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,330
follow up with have you forgotten your

423
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:38,709
login credentials shall we send them

424
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:40,750
again and of course yeah nice

425
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,879
so as an attacker you get a payment

426
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,059
portal it's all on the service of the

427
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:48,070
company it looks completely legit they

428
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:52,509
fill in all the data and that is

429
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:55,299
important including their Eibon and as

430
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:57,460
soon as they do that of course nothing

431
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:00,480
happens except that this Ivan gets

432
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:03,220
blacklisted the bank gets informed and

433
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,190
they don't receive any money its foiled

434
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,590
and they can't use that account with

435
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,779
this Ivan ever again and it's more

436
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:14,370
really really more complicated to get a

437
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:14,370
new bank account than to get a new email

438
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,019
by the way if you're interested in

439
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,940
sharing throttle and eibon's please come

440
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:25,299
talk to me we are still trying to figure

441
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,350
out how to do that and be legitimate

442
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,679
within the gdpr

443
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,330
because as the good guys we have the

444
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,480
problem that we can't share data that

445
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,990
easily as the bad guys can do but this

446
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,179
is a really nice way how you actually

447
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,990
can can deal with them certain

448
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:45,730
engineering attacks on your employees

449
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:48,970
another thing I'd like to point out is

450
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,429
password some of you probably can't hear

451
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,230
that anymore but still passwords are

452
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:55,960
still there they are still there for

453
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,210
authentication and if you are at your

454
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,909
workplace of course please use strong

455
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,110
passwords uses password safe if your

456
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:03,669
company doesn't provide you with a

457
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,008
password safe to try to get one of them

458
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:08,049
three months like key pass on one of

459
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:10,149
those because use a strong password

460
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:11,679
everywhere even if you're just doing a

461
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,340
proof of concept setting up a test

462
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,070
machine

463
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,899
don't use test test as a password please

464
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,399
because whenever this goes into

465
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:21,789
production people will forget about it

466
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:24,590
and everything is a gate into your

467
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:28,879
network so yeah use

468
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:30,260
passwords and by Stone passwords I mean

469
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,510
something that you probably can't

470
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,230
remember that's why I think you need a

471
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,900
password safe Allah but what's the point

472
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,510
in having strong passwords for your

473
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,789
elderly relatives for your friends who

474
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,950
are not that computer savvy and for

475
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:49,010
people who are not working in IT at

476
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,929
they're at home for example well they

477
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:54,590
can still use a password safe if he if

478
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:57,730
they know how to do how to use it but on

479
00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:01,309
the other hand I see people bashing

480
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,529
other people whose relatives and parents

481
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:07,760
use little books and write the passwords

482
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:10,309
down I think by all means if your granny

483
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,620
needs to write down her password then

484
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:14,000
let her because whenever she's writing

485
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,469
it down it's going to be a better

486
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,940
password than just the name of the

487
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:22,100
service like apple and one two three

488
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:23,750
four and why I'm why I'm saying that the

489
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,510
thing is you have to consider threat

490
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,419
vectors if there's a burglar breaking

491
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,890
and entering into your granny's house

492
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:34,730
he's not at all interested in her

493
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:37,220
Facebook account he or she whoever broke

494
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,500
in wants to have the valuables and wants

495
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,179
to have money once if the jewelry they

496
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,890
won't steal the password book because

497
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:47,690
it's a different kind of attack it's of

498
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,330
course different in here in your company

499
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,100
but for people at home I think if they

500
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,590
write their passwords down they have

501
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,230
better passwords and please please if

502
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,260
you know developers who don't let people

503
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,960
paste passwords in possible fields

504
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:08,929
please show them to some dark corner tar

505
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:12,200
them and feather them and of course

506
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:14,870
thank you and of course you can use

507
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,850
two-factor authentication again some

508
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,549
people say oh that's broken as well but

509
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,529
it's a good model if you want to use it

510
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:23,658
it's better than not having two-factor

511
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:25,610
authentication of course again for your

512
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:28,190
relatives it might be a little bit more

513
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:31,149
difficult and at the end of the day we

514
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,440
in security very very very often try to

515
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:36,289
come up with a solution that fits

516
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,799
everybody one size fits all and I don't

517
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,840
think we have that

518
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,220
and if you think your granny needs a bit

519
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,738
of protection than the President of the

520
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:47,629
United States then maybe you're a little

521
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:49,590
bit too permanent I don't know I mean I

522
00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:53,100
can't believe I'm here on stage

523
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:58,139
defending Trump but again you you get

524
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:00,360
the the gist of that and I don't know

525
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:01,019
how I'm with the 30 minutes you have

526
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,269
nearly there

527
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,489
my one of my last points is awareness

528
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:07,049
training probably if your company is

529
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:09,059
large enough you have to suffer through

530
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,279
that and it really depends on the

531
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:14,158
company whether this is anything

532
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,609
interesting or not and please make

533
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,080
awareness training interesting because

534
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:21,418
you know if you're sitting somewhere and

535
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,299
you have to listen to a guy rambling on

536
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:26,850
about stuff like you do just now if it

537
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:28,918
interests you it's probably going to

538
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,149
stick in your mind if it doesn't

539
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,539
interest you at all and you will have

540
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:38,988
forgotten it by next Tuesday avoid fear

541
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:38,989
uncertainty and doubt these are my main

542
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:44,820
this is what I really like to avoid

543
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:48,779
because I see that so very often that we

544
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:53,220
try to sell security by spreading a few

545
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:56,369
D and it never helps because forcing

546
00:24:53,220 --> 00:25:00,480
somebody to do something and using fear

547
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:02,609
as the main motivator might work once it

548
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,100
will not work the second time because

549
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:06,869
people are not that stupid and funnily

550
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,168
enough if you treat your users as adults

551
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:12,149
um it's much easier to talk to them than

552
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:15,840
just pointing the thing of them and

553
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:18,928
spreading fu D multiple choice click

554
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,830
fests I probably don't need to tell you

555
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:24,749
that but they are completely useless in

556
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,340
my opinion because you just learned

557
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:28,470
their answers the answers very often are

558
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,899
not right but you know which answer they

559
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:35,340
want to hear so you just tick that box

560
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:38,729
there and that all doesn't work so what

561
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:42,539
we started doing is we engaged our users

562
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,489
we have various of formats very open

563
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,320
formats where you can just talk about

564
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:49,769
security and wear attendance is

565
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,299
voluntary so you could come up you could

566
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:53,460
listen to somebody talking about

567
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,860
security and the security issues was

568
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,019
never talking down to the users it was

569
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,519
how can you stay safe when you're at

570
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:02,639
home what can you do

571
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:06,210
why are antivirus engines still relevant

572
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:08,729
for you at home whatever and it works

573
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,220
really well especially if you use

574
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,749
multiple channels we have a block or

575
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,820
several blocks actually where we're

576
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:16,499
talking about security stuff and with

577
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,928
blocks you know if you're interested you

578
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:21,179
can read it but you don't have to and

579
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:23,009
you can read it whenever you want to and

580
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,669
you don't have to be there at Wednesday

581
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:28,049
at 10:00 or something like that and

582
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:31,080
we've got several of them office

583
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:33,450
structures where we do those talks and

584
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,559
you can just go there and listen to it

585
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,679
and if you don't like it you can just

586
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,658
leave and nobody will notice so we're

587
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,820
not quite there yet that we do not have

588
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,789
the multiple choice click fests they are

589
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,980
still being done by internal security

590
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:51,480
we're trying to get away from that but

591
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:54,480
so far we have both but judging from the

592
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,619
feedback our method of teaching security

593
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,080
is more approved by the users than the

594
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:03,658
traditional method and again if you do

595
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,330
something after-hours and out of office

596
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,950
hours just be so nice and provide at

597
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,899
least drinks or a little bit of snacks

598
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:15,509
or food people will stick around much

599
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:18,359
longer and the last point I think I have

600
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:20,970
is I think you really need to find the

601
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:25,499
right language this is a tweet from this

602
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:28,830
year's Def Con I plopped out the name

603
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:31,379
because well it was it was an open tweet

604
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,389
and it was public but still somebody

605
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:36,090
posted during DEFCON that he would rap

606
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:38,189
rather attack black hat attendees than

607
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:44,369
Def Con attendees what do you think

608
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:46,669
happened after the treatment life they

609
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:48,988
call the police and they kicked him out

610
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:51,840
that was before talking to Def Con

611
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:53,549
organizes it was the hotel so if you

612
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,928
consider that last year on 1st of

613
00:27:53,549 --> 00:28:02,399
October sorry that I walked into the v-j

614
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:04,539
a shooter managed to kill I think over

615
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,738
50 people in it in short

616
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:10,989
800 or more people then this kind of

617
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:12,999
treat at a Las Vegas conference hotel is

618
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,440
not the right language because he was

619
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:18,219
not talking about shooting people of

620
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:21,209
course that outside of our industry this

621
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:25,179
is not known so of course they would be

622
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:27,579
down heavily on him he was able to

623
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:30,159
reattempt the conference I think but of

624
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:36,249
course it costs in cost him a lot of

625
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:39,549
problems yeah so my conclusion is again

626
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:42,039
don't really buy a lot of more boxes you

627
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:43,679
probably have all the boxes in your

628
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,449
network that you need to do a proper job

629
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,079
at least if your company has been around

630
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:50,440
for a bit

631
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:52,539
but try to educate your users they might

632
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,789
be seen as the weakest link but on the

633
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:56,829
other hand I don't think they are and

634
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,579
with a little bit of education you can

635
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:02,559
make them to your best defense be the

636
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:05,019
social engineering attack or anything

637
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,719
else if they notice something that is

638
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:11,229
suspicious to them they might report it

639
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:12,969
to you if they feel that it's better for

640
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:15,399
the overall safety for the company and

641
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:17,229
if they can do that without fear of

642
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:18,789
looking dumb or without the fear of

643
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:22,419
retribution because they did something

644
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:24,399
wrong so there are some links in the

645
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:28,389
slides and I will provide you the slides

646
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:31,629
later on and thanks for listening thanks

647
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:33,008
for having me at these sites and since

648
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,809
it's the end of the talk and you stay

649
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:36,969
time till now now I feel good with

650
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:39,249
talking a little bit about myself I work

651
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:42,099
for a company called dot if we are a

652
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:44,859
software manufacturing company mostly in

653
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:47,559
Germany outside Germany we are not

654
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:49,269
really well-known we are about 7,000

655
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:51,789
people working there writing software

656
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:55,989
for tax consultants and tax accountants

657
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:59,579
and I'm part of the internet security

658
00:29:55,989 --> 00:29:59,579
team thank you very much

659
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:10,169
so thank you very much for this hidden

660
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,590
threesome talk do we have any one that

661
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,950
to launch description

662
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:23,189
[Music]

663
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:26,340
I have only one mic so I you you can

664
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:30,300
actually share I bands on this platform

665
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:33,449
and limited to only financial sector so

666
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:36,419
I think that's the best way to be

667
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,190
develop comprehensive just if you share

668
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,950
just this financial sector it's

669
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,480
basically for making the business work

670
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,310
so that should be okay

671
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,900
thank you very much it's not a technical

672
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:52,110
problem with the sharing we thought

673
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:55,470
about exactly that kind of platform the

674
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:57,990
problem we are facing it kind of fits in

675
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:01,440
what what Klaus said about GDP are our

676
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:05,910
internal lawyers say that this item

677
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,590
might be PII and so we would have to ask

678
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:11,580
the bad guy whether he feels comfortable

679
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:13,290
of that information being shared and we

680
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,530
had this is an internal struggle we

681
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:18,240
still need the okay to share those

682
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,510
iPhones and that would be one platform

683
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,640
to do it thank you

684
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:26,520
and we'll next a thank you for the great

685
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,400
presentation I have two questions that's

686
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,800
okay the first thing I read a lot of

687
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,440
roles was to create awareness on related

688
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,870
topics and one thing that seems to come

689
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,150
up a lot recently is that security

690
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:41,370
awareness is dead we need to give up on

691
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:43,860
this and find another way do you agree

692
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:49,590
that it's not working at all and we just

693
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:50,459
need to find no I don't have to give you

694
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,610
one example

695
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,770
you probably familiar with LinkedIn

696
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:58,709
there's a German platform like LinkedIn

697
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:00,180
but it's called Singh you might have

698
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,590
heard about that I think even they

699
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,800
provided the tickets for that or the

700
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:07,620
ticketing system and there was one

701
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,169
account saying hey I'm software

702
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,639
specialist at Dartmouth and he connected

703
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,380
to a lot of people and we don't know

704
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,300
whether this was in preparation for a

705
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,180
social engineering attack on us or one

706
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,460
of our clients but within I would say

707
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,970
hours we got first feedback from users

708
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:26,429
who not working in security saying I

709
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:29,129
don't know this guy and he contact

710
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:31,769
me do you know them so we found out he's

711
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:33,959
not working at us and we just wrote an

712
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,369
internal email saying don't accept

713
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,169
friendship requests from them because

714
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:39,149
it's just in preparation for an attack

715
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:41,399
or somebody who's a choke or something

716
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:43,529
like that and this wouldn't be possible

717
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:45,330
without security awareness if nobody

718
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:47,850
really cared about that they wouldn't

719
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:50,059
have informed us of that account if that

720
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:53,100
answers your question

721
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:55,499
the second question is I think everyone

722
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,619
is worried about making music secure

723
00:32:55,499 --> 00:33:01,950
aware but I am more more worried than

724
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:04,740
struggling actually is making news more

725
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,269
suited aware I found it much harder to

726
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,119
work with engineers when the security

727
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:12,539
awareness and making them adapt to grow

728
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:15,408
more secure I thought was if you have

729
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:18,809
some tips on that that would be great

730
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:21,539
yeah I think if you've got somebody who

731
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:25,289
doesn't really work in security at all

732
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:27,389
they are more open to suggestions if you

733
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:29,519
have people who think they know it

734
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:32,248
better it's a little bit more difficult

735
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,799
but very often in discussions you can

736
00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:37,470
come to a certain level of agreement

737
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,440
because for example I don't expect all

738
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:42,269
the people I talk to to come up with the

739
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,369
same opinions as I have there might be

740
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:47,700
people violently debating the possible

741
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:49,590
thing for example with the book lying at

742
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,080
home and things like that and again

743
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,720
there's this one security one one size

744
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,899
doesn't fit all with engineers very

745
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,960
often if you talk to them you find out

746
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:03,570
that the reason why they are blocking

747
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,019
something is not because they think it's

748
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:09,690
bad but because it causes them pain in

749
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:11,668
some kind of other process so you have

750
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,559
to carefully see where the real reason

751
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:16,049
is why they are blocking something or

752
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:19,799
why they really hate anti wires or

753
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:22,290
whatever and try to find a way to cope

754
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:24,540
with that at the end of the day you

755
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:26,549
can't let them free rein so you can't

756
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,109
say to seven thousand people to what you

757
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:30,149
want with your security you have to have

758
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:32,639
a set of guidelines but if you make it

759
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:35,668
too strict people will find ways around

760
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,179
it and I found that talking to people

761
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:41,179
really helps in in getting a better

762
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,179
result

763
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,790
yeah thank you for the last point about

764
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,500
not making it too strict

765
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,600
because when working with security

766
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,210
policies and so on that comes to mind a

767
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,710
lot and the thing is why it's so hard as

768
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,950
engineers because they can always find

769
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,720
ways around the controls or the security

770
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:04,040
policies that we usually put in place

771
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:07,129
and they can just evade it so that's why

772
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,830
it's a bit much harder as a man I can't

773
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,510
find an answer to which level you need

774
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,340
to put your security policy on if you

775
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,160
would eat too much or too strict in the

776
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,640
middle so yeah I think that's a

777
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,990
continuous fight that will never end I

778
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,520
agree and there's no good answer for

779
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:30,100
that because that again would be some

780
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:30,100
one-size-fits-all answer um thank you I

781
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,900
have small come in there while I do in

782
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,980
general agree that fat is bad and you

783
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,290
should definitely not fight your

784
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,470
colleagues or and end it security

785
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,830
awareness tell them the truth InfoSec is

786
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:49,370
a politican and as you probably all are

787
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:52,370
aware global politics institutions have

788
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,900
agendas and I'm Danish and the Danish

789
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,310
government every time there's a crisis

790
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,780
they have a pre-prepared list of things

791
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,060
that they want to do that might be even

792
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,560
borderline unconstitutional and for

793
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,990
every crisis they get this one thing

794
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,940
through you see is then they receive

795
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:08,419
them happening in like the US and so on

796
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,670
I recommend that you as an InfoSec

797
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,560
Department your blue team if you're the

798
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,930
seaso even better you have a list of

799
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,430
your main blocking points the things

800
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,500
that are preventing you from maturing

801
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,799
your security operations and forever

802
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:24,980
Isis every time someone up use it

803
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,900
tell them cut them like L tell them I

804
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,720
need this point fixed or it cannot get

805
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,110
better use let no good crisis ever go to

806
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,750
waste

807
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:34,750
thank you thank you

808
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:46,860
I like the idea of a blacklisting Ibans

809
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,470
it's a very nice concept I think there's

810
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,650
lots of fun hidden there like

811
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:55,549
blacklisting the Iban of the text

812
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,560
authority or of the social security

813
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:00,030
organizations and all of them so if the

814
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,610
organization if the company doesn't pay

815
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:06,660
their taxes anymore because the Ivan has

816
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:09,720
been blacklisted internally yeah fun

817
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,730
I agree but this wouldn't be an open

818
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,200
platform it wouldn't be something where

819
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,810
you can just put in a list of all the

820
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,939
iPhones you don't like and you're done

821
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,980
with it at the moment as as I said we're

822
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,520
carefully we are working with two

823
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,890
companies and at a level where you think

824
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,360
the pranksters well one of them is

825
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,879
probably standing in front of you but

826
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,370
even I would refrain from putting the

827
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,120
Ivan on that list because it has severe

828
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:38,100
repercussions if such a list I don't

829
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:47,549
think it would be ever be completely

830
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:49,259
public but yeah yeah yeah thanks for

831
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,220
giving me ideas when I ever want to quit

832
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:59,160
the company in style

833
00:37:50,220 --> 00:38:02,970
I want wanted to come back to mod either

834
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,980
ons point of view and so because I'm

835
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,109
also trying and working a lot in this in

836
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,420
this sector and what I always say is

837
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:12,030
that user is not the weakest link it's

838
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,790
your last resort because in the end when

839
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:18,000
all your security controls fails it's up

840
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:19,980
to the decision of the user that will

841
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,600
save the day or not and when you speak

842
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,180
to them like this and it's come back to

843
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,920
your policy question and it's the same

844
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,690
for your sis engineer when you empower

845
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,850
them and you give them a responsibility

846
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,280
saying you will maybe save the day and

847
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,259
then you hit cognize it later it changes

848
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,340
everything

849
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:41,820
absolutely dr. Jessica Parker opens with

850
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,160
a with a tweet from Emma W that says if

851
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,140
security doesn't work for the users it

852
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,549
doesn't work

853
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:55,500
and something I also always do when I'm

854
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:59,319
doing awareness session is that I'm I'm

855
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:02,500
trying to demystify to remove the magic

856
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:03,190
about malware's because for a lot of

857
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,619
users

858
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,480
it's like malware something you never

859
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:10,089
seen they don't know what it is and so

860
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,550
on so I bring my wife and I execute them

861
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:14,799
in DVM just to show them because we had

862
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:17,109
kids these were physically users so they

863
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,030
I knew it was fishing I knew it but I

864
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:23,589
just wanted to see what's going to

865
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:26,200
happen so trust me that happens and and

866
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:29,500
yeah I can understand that

867
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,609
so yeah I'm always trying to show them

868
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,950
it's easy

869
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:34,900
this is there's nothing to see just so

870
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,879
that they have seen it once okay now

871
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:40,300
they know it and yeah they will not do

872
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,150
it again yeah I think it's a very good

873
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,859
good point because if you take away the

874
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:47,460
mystification of stuff then you just

875
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:50,170
make it real and people see well yeah

876
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,990
it's just malware it's just doing this

877
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,819
and that it's not that fear and

878
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,490
uncertainty in the background that it

879
00:39:54,819 --> 00:40:00,040
might do stuff that is nearly impossible

880
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,810
I'm not saying that a lot of the things

881
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,940
that uses attribute to malware are

882
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,279
impossible but again you have to think

883
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,349
about who you are and who would spend a

884
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:12,400
lot of resources to get your personal

885
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:14,560
data if it's easier to buy a screwdriver

886
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,970
and Ram it until you need to get the

887
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,680
information out of you then people will

888
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,529
do that if that information is that

889
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:27,149
valuable and this is something to bear

890
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:27,150
in mind small anymore questions

891
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:32,569
okay so thank you very much thank you
