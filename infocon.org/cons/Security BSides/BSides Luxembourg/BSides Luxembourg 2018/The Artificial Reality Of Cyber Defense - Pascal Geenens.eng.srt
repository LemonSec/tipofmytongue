1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,860
please thank you happy to be here happy

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,830
to see that people are still in the room

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:16,979
is getting late and was long day some

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:20,169
interesting talks I saw so 2016

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,890
Microsoft set out to do an experiment so

6
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:25,570
they built a chat Bob yeah some people

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,939
probably already know where I'm going to

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,679
right so they build the chat bot and

9
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:31,539
integrated it with Twitter Twitter which

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,820
is a great platform to integrate chat

11
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,550
BOTS because it has an API that allows

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,770
you to integrate very easily so they set

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:43,510
out to do an experiment on human

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:46,360
interaction and also how a new kind of

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,640
Bob can learn from interacting with

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,310
people so they created the bot called

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,900
tie and tie was supposed to be or

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:58,270
started out as a teenage girl so in the

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,300
idea was having people interact with

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,310
that boat and as they go forward the bot

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,399
will learn more from people and will be

22
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,109
more clever in its answers now there

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,719
were a couple of guys from 4chan who

24
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:12,969
picked up on tie and the experiment from

25
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,899
Microsoft and they started trolling

26
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:20,280
around with time and within 24 hours the

27
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:25,020
little innocent tie actually became a

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,719
trump loving Nazy nosy supporter and

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,298
sex-crazed ball so they had to just plug

30
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:34,178
out flick it out of Twitter because it

31
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,549
became too crazy so that's an example of

32
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:39,969
what can go wrong and also a good

33
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:44,619
example of what we call poisoning in in

34
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:47,469
data so today I'm gonna talk about

35
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,999
artificial reality or better artificial

36
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:51,219
intelligence I'd like to call it

37
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:54,429
artificial reality in my topic because

38
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:57,219
there's a lot of talk around artificial

39
00:01:54,429 --> 00:02:00,909
intelligence and I would not call it a

40
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:03,009
hype but sometimes even though it's

41
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:04,929
technically correct there's different

42
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:07,149
families of artificial intelligence that

43
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:08,709
are being abused under the name

44
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,140
artificial intelligence if you go to

45
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,269
info security for example you will see

46
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,369
that every next booth has a title

47
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,130
artificial intelligence for security for

48
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,060
better secure

49
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,100
so I started out this presentation to

50
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,450
show people the difference and all the

51
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,340
different domains and artificial

52
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,920
intelligence how we actually already

53
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,870
been using kinds of artificial

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,200
intelligence which we call machine

55
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,690
learning in the past how we have been

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,760
seeing new technologies like deep

57
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,670
learning coming out and how we can see

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,350
them used in cybersecurity but also what

59
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,160
are the challenges with deep learning

60
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:50,019
and why does it not always a good fit

61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,700
for cybersecurity but before I get in to

62
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,380
more details I want to start with

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,570
setting the problem and I think that

64
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,730
everybody is familiar with the cyber

65
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,190
kill chain not here to go through the

66
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,769
whole cyber kill chain I just want it up

67
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,950
there to show you that there's actually

68
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:10,010
plenty opportunities to detect malicious

69
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,339
activity in your network even though

70
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,859
that there's so many opportunities why

71
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,780
is it that organizations and thank you

72
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,480
Walter for the previous presentation

73
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,570
because the report numbers actually

74
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,100
represent what I'm saying here so how

75
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,400
come that organization are still getting

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,579
breached and only find out a couple of

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,300
months later and the way that they find

78
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,130
out is either because their security

79
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,810
researchers on the dark web that saw

80
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,220
that there were records being traded

81
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,410
from that company but otherwise that

82
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,540
would have never found found it another

83
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,490
way to ransom of course on some hacker

84
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,280
can come to them and say hey I have that

85
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,350
much information from you so you pay up

86
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,470
or otherwise I will publish and now with

87
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,900
the new GDP our loss that ransom can be

88
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,359
pretty high so for me there's actually

89
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,430
two reasons for this first reason is not

90
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,640
enough events if you don't have the

91
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,440
visibility you can of course not see the

92
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,709
malicious events that are happening on

93
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,600
your network the most important for me

94
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm probably the most prevalent in most

95
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,980
networks because we all have sensors and

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,040
we all centralized our logs we all get

97
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:25,250
the events in is too many events there's

98
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,810
too much noise you cannot see the real

99
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,700
important events and all the noise you

100
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,540
don't have enough humans you don't have

101
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,849
enough X

102
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,240
to grow through all those events and

103
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,920
make sure if there is an actual

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,520
malicious intent in that event or it's a

105
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,130
false positive and that brings me to

106
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,500
this world of security it has always

107
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,650
been about minimizing false positives

108
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,900
and false negatives so minimizing false

109
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,169
negatives you know that a false negative

110
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,179
is an actual malicious event that's

111
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,610
going on but you cannot detect it so

112
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:02,660
it's clear why we want to minimize that

113
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,390
event a false positive is something that

114
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,310
is raised as being an attack or a

115
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,440
malicious event but actually it turns

116
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,300
out after investigation there was

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,270
nothing wrong it was just an application

118
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,240
that was not completely 100% according

119
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,710
to the RFC or a new application that

120
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,060
came onto the network that you didn't

121
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:25,099
know up of up front so we're all about

122
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,710
minimizing false positives and false

123
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,780
negatives however the thing about false

124
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,859
positives and false negatives they are

125
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,059
related and not in a nice way so if you

126
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,090
look at the bottom line at the

127
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,800
sensitivity of detection the more

128
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,310
sensitivity that you put in your

129
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,290
detection the more false positives you

130
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,000
will get of course you will also detect

131
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,120
a malicious event so you will actually

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,490
have a very good system for blocking

133
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,530
attacks and for detecting attacks but at

134
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,110
the same time you will have so much

135
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,450
noise that you cannot filter out the

136
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,700
good events on the other side if you

137
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,099
allow everything if you have a very low

138
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,550
sensitivity of detection or you have a

139
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,750
firewall that passes everything you will

140
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:14,810
have no noise but at the same time it's

141
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:18,770
open fields for the hackers for the

142
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:21,620
attackers better now there are ways to

143
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,320
lower that false negative you can use a

144
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,810
negative security model using signatures

145
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,960
of known attacks you can push that line

146
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,910
down but still the optimum is still over

147
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,799
there with lots of false positives so we

148
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:38,600
still have a problem with those false

149
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,760
positive events in our detection now

150
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,710
security threats are growing faster our

151
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,659
budgets are getting well

152
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,299
maybe not smaller but they're not

153
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,550
getting bigger and the teams and the

154
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,270
experts there's a huge talent gap on the

155
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,890
market to find good experts and at the

156
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,750
same time we are gathering more

157
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,669
information more data we are getting

158
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,320
more aware so there's a big gap there

159
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,780
now we have already ruled based event

160
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,440
correlation systems like in traditional

161
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:12,859
Sims but the traditional rule based

162
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,440
correlation also depends on humans it's

163
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,850
humans putting in the rules it's humans

164
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,650
finding an event that was a false

165
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,300
positive or knowing that couple of

166
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,090
events that they found in a research

167
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,070
they put up some rules so that next time

168
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,380
and those events come in they are

169
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,780
reduced to a single event and that will

170
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,430
give us some reduction of events but you

171
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,760
go from millions to a couple of

172
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,730
thousands no security operations center

173
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,760
can handle thousands of events a large

174
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,440
Sock'em maybe handle a couple of hundred

175
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,380
and if you give me fifty events in one

176
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,570
day after eight hours beside being tired

177
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:52,270
and going crazy I think the first few

178
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:55,010
events I will analyze with some good

179
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:58,039
motivation but after a while if you get

180
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:01,010
to event 30 and 40 you get tired and you

181
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,540
are tempting to say well maybe this is a

182
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:06,980
false positive and you will miss the

183
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:10,580
actual event so we need more and better

184
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:15,680
automation to get further in that hunt

185
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:17,750
for real events that we want to see so

186
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,040
in that automation we will find in

187
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:24,440
machine learning now I told you that

188
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,690
artificial intelligence is a very broad

189
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,490
domain and there's lots of subdomains

190
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,520
and in those subdomains there is already

191
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,020
technologies that we have been using for

192
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,419
quite some times and there are some

193
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,819
technologies that all the talk is about

194
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,890
and it's difficult sometimes in the

195
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,530
press or are also when people are

196
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,020
talking to you especially the sales side

197
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,850
of the vendors when they're talking to

198
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,560
you what they mean by AI are they

199
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,570
talking about machine learning are they

200
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,699
talking about deep learning one thing I

201
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,320
know it's not about the real artificial

202
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
intelligence because real artificial

203
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,190
intelligence as far as

204
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,690
I know there's no one application out

205
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,600
there that uses real artificial

206
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:05,060
intelligence the artificial intelligence

207
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,050
itself is a system that can sense it can

208
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,689
reason it can act it can change itself

209
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,479
based on its surroundings so it is aware

210
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:17,330
of what's happening and it can pivot to

211
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,940
another problem domain to solve its

212
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,890
problem which I never saw in security

213
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,620
but I do see in security however is

214
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,480
everything that's under machine learning

215
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,060
machine learning is an algorithm that

216
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,100
gets better at a specific task

217
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,410
so it has one specific task to perform

218
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,590
has been developed to do that task and

219
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,760
it gets better as it sees more data from

220
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,340
the environment itself

221
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,330
it's like customizing itself to get

222
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:47,740
better at prediction and then a newer

223
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,450
kind of machine learning so one specific

224
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,590
algorithm of one specific domain insight

225
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,940
machine learning is neural networks and

226
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,860
also the deep neural networks of the

227
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,980
deep learning those are all the talks

228
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:04,000
that are about what Google does what old

229
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,950
hyper clouds are doing face recognition

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,980
automatic classification of visuals and

231
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,200
objects and photographs so this is the

232
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,810
newest trend and this is typically when

233
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,910
people talk about AI mostly now they are

234
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,829
referring to deep learning but deep

235
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,870
learning is just one category of

236
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,760
algorithms hidden machine learning and

237
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:30,050
machine learning sits in that hole

238
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:31,670
bigger domain which is AI now for some

239
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,040
it will be an introduction for some it

240
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,430
will be a review and just wanted to give

241
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,560
you a little bit of an idea what deep

242
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,170
learning is and how it works so how does

243
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,709
a neural network work it's modeled after

244
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,569
the brain it's not simulating the brain

245
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,220
so it's far from how our brain is

246
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,410
working it's much more complex in the

247
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,050
brain but it's modeled after the idea of

248
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,939
brain and it comes out that by building

249
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,130
those networks we can do some really

250
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,740
interesting things now actually the

251
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,620
technology here and all the principles

252
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,990
that we see here is not new technology

253
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:09,050
this is something that was been written

254
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,330
about in the 1940s and in the 1960

255
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,569
we already had the first neural networks

256
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,550
running in computing of course they

257
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,980
lacked computing power they lacked

258
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,500
memory but the most important thing that

259
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,980
they like to make really effective use

260
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,350
of deep learning is data one thing that

261
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,829
we need for deep learning to work well

262
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,720
is lots and lots of data now in the past

263
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:36,380
few years we had the hyper clouds like

264
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,870
Facebook's and Google and Alibaba what

265
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,630
all those have is they sit on a very

266
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,910
large amount of data and that made deep

267
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,279
learning in the recent years really

268
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,170
breakthrough technology for solving

269
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:52,970
certain problems that were too complex

270
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:56,750
before for us to solve so a neural

271
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,850
network consists of many perceptrons and

272
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,420
a perceptron has an input vector it just

273
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,570
has some lines coming in and those lines

274
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,959
are summed together well every line

275
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:11,420
every input value that comes in first is

276
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,130
weighted with a weight vector and then

277
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,990
we will sum them together and we will

278
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,689
run them through function typically in

279
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,149
non linear function and that will

280
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,399
provide an output so that's just one

281
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:24,649
block inside such a neural network and

282
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,440
by combining many of those perceptrons

283
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:30,410
together in multiple layers multiple

284
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,709
perceptrons we can have or we can create

285
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,469
a network that can be trained based on

286
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:41,359
data and that can generalize using

287
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:43,399
information now the whole idea here is

288
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,529
to Train a network and for training what

289
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,260
we will do is actually we will optimize

290
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:51,110
the global error so we will give it an

291
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,329
image of a can it will show it to him

292
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,860
and he will say no it's I think it's a

293
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:56,959
dog and you say no no it's not a dog

294
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,630
it's a cat so we're gonna change the

295
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,119
weights on the input vectors on the

296
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,250
input side to make sure that he decides

297
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,500
that the image that you showed him is a

298
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,940
cat next time you show another cat he

299
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,220
comes back at the dog you say no no

300
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,610
change the weights and like this you're

301
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,310
gonna continuously change the weights so

302
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:19,040
a deep learning network is just many

303
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:21,050
many layers of those perceptrons

304
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,660
and it's configured through its weights

305
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:27,019
so what you do is actually you present

306
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:29,449
data on the input you know the

307
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:32,630
classification of that data so you show

308
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:35,529
it images of cats and dogs you know for

309
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,970
each image that is a cat that is a dog

310
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,279
whenever it comes out wrong

311
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,040
you will change the weights until it

312
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:46,490
comes out correct and you will do that

313
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,699
with millions of different pictures to

314
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,279
train the model once it is train you

315
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:54,560
will test the model typically when you

316
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:59,360
have your images for training

317
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,550
you look categorize them in two sets one

318
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,180
set is for the actual training the other

319
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:07,130
set is for evaluation to look at how

320
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,920
good is a network performing after

321
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,899
training and then after that once you

322
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,300
did that once you have a performing

323
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:17,000
network you will put it in real

324
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,709
production a real production means that

325
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,350
you will show it a picture that it never

326
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,388
saw and it will tell you that's a cat or

327
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,639
that's a dog depending on the picture

328
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:28,519
and most of the time it will be correct

329
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,769
I say most of the time because sometimes

330
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,639
it will come out with really strange

331
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:36,639
decisions now those training decisions

332
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,459
that is a problem with deep learning

333
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,839
most of the time we cannot explain them

334
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:44,630
because it's too many interactions out

335
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,000
there even though it's it's mathematics

336
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,010
it's just matrix calculation so it's

337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,440
very deterministic but at the same time

338
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:55,100
it's too complex for our brains to even

339
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,410
imagine what is happening in there you

340
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:03,110
can I have an example later on to

341
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:05,300
illustrate that so that was deep

342
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,399
learning but before I come back to deep

343
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,779
learning want to talk about traditional

344
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:10,939
machine learning because that is

345
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:14,060
something that we have been using for

346
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:16,269
quite some time already and that isn't

347
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,930
used today for protecting our networks

348
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:22,970
so traditional machine learning is

349
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:25,670
solving low to medium complexity

350
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:30,019
problems those are problems that we

351
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:31,410
humans can model in our brains think

352
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:35,040
about TC

353
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,170
P and the RFC's for TCP the RFC is like

354
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,670
a contract a contract that makes

355
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:43,439
communication between two machines

356
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:45,269
possible right TCP is a state table you

357
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,579
can implement it as a state machine and

358
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:50,449
then you can follow the complete state

359
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:53,579
of how a TCP connection should work

360
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:56,160
should work with the syn syn ack ack and

361
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:59,638
then at the end you will see a reset or

362
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,889
a fin so we know exactly how it needs to

363
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,399
work so to build something to track

364
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:08,730
anomalies on TCP we can build a state

365
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,459
machine in a program now the problem

366
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,560
with that state machine is if you're not

367
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:16,170
working stateless or better if you're

368
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,420
not working stateful you will see lots

369
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,399
of things coming but at some point you

370
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,740
need to make a decision am i under a syn

371
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,930
attack or not so if you have a detail

372
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,300
syn attack you will see lots of sins

373
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,758
come in and you will never get a cynic

374
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,609
or ACK or something else so you need to

375
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,800
look at the distribution of those flags

376
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,439
but you don't know how much sins exactly

377
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,990
are an attack because in transactional

378
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:42,660
environment and Finance you will have

379
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,610
lots of sessions that meet that you will

380
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,579
have lots of sins coming in per second

381
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,670
however in streaming services like

382
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:53,310
Netflix you will only have a few sins

383
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:56,880
per minute because those are typically

384
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,500
very long sessions so you need to adapt

385
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,220
to the environment so there what you

386
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,890
will do is use data and probabilistic or

387
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,809
probability and based on the data on

388
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,699
what you see in that environment you

389
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,039
will adapt the different thresholds to

390
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,880
do the detection so you're still based

391
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:17,579
on rate and variant analysis with a

392
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,429
distribution of the flags but the actual

393
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,959
thresholds will change based on data

394
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,839
that you learned from that specific

395
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,270
network for that environment that's an

396
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,070
example of machine learning but this is

397
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,039
an algorithm that is very deterministic

398
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,559
it's a human who wrote to program that

399
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:37,020
algorithm the human can also know very

400
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,889
well when something goes wrong why it

401
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,780
goes wrong and also at the same time we

402
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,120
know that there will be a low rate of

403
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,460
false positives because we know exact

404
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,250
how it behaved so we can put a measure

405
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,860
even on how much false positives to

406
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,100
expect in an environment but that

407
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:59,429
typically you can only do when the

408
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,500
problem is not too complex I was talking

409
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,140
about TCP we can wrap our mind around

410
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,780
the TCP session and what happens with

411
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,800
TCP sessions in the network but try to

412
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,480
wrap your mind about all the data flows

413
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,750
that go on in your network and somebody

414
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,090
tells you ok you need to write a program

415
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,690
that will analyze all the traffic

416
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,159
through the parameter everything that

417
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,280
you see coming and you need to detect

418
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,380
anomalies well you have to write a very

419
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,120
specific code for all the applications

420
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,500
application are getting added by the

421
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,030
time that you can write an application

422
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,830
like that that you did all the

423
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,410
investigation there's already new

424
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:40,620
application updates it's impossible to

425
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:43,830
write code to do that right so for this

426
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,260
you need something like deep learning

427
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,860
because deep learning is programming by

428
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,840
example so the way that you use deep

429
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,659
learning versus the traditional machine

430
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,360
learning is that here you have a generic

431
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,770
model that can be applied for different

432
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,129
kinds of problems and that model can be

433
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:07,889
tuned using data you need a large amount

434
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,100
of data and you need good data no

435
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,320
garbage in garbage out so only good data

436
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,809
and label data needs to go in but if you

437
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,830
have a large amount of good data you put

438
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:22,020
it in that model it will create an

439
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,928
approximation of what your network is

440
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,179
and how it behaves and then based on new

441
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:29,970
information that comes in after training

442
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:33,809
it will be able to say that this is an

443
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,850
anomaly or this is normal data and the

444
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:39,120
way to think about deep learning and

445
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:41,428
also neural networks is about curve

446
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,159
fitting it's nothing more than curve

447
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:46,800
fitting so if you put it and this is now

448
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,610
a one dimensional problem so you have a

449
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,919
couple of crosses here and if you have

450
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:55,709
those data points those samples each

451
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,990
crosses one data point one sample that

452
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,559
you give to the network you can draw a

453
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,379
curve

454
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,200
to those points and that curve actually

455
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:06,689
how do you draw the best curve to those

456
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,879
points that's the mathematical function

457
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,820
that comes down to minimizing the error

458
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:13,350
between each of the crosses and the

459
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,309
curve so it's just a problem of

460
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:21,029
minimizing the global error now the same

461
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:23,970
happens in deep learning however not in

462
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:26,549
one dimension in thousands maybe

463
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,340
hundreds of thousands of dimensions so

464
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:31,289
something that's difficult for us to

465
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,779
interpret as a human but it comes down

466
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:35,549
to this it's just like curve fitting

467
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,590
it's fitting fitting in a hyper

468
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,539
dimensional plane to all the data

469
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:44,189
samples that you're feeding to that

470
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:46,769
network so in this case for me it's more

471
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:53,039
like programming with data instead of

472
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:57,600
programming with code now to put both of

473
00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:00,480
them against each other on the left side

474
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,399
I put up traditional machine learning on

475
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,730
the right side you have the deep

476
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:08,639
learning on the left side the influence

477
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:11,159
of code so the program that you built

478
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:13,979
the model that you're creating will be

479
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:17,639
dominant and all the data that you're

480
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:21,360
using to make that code learn is only

481
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:23,459
there to provide a baseline it will get

482
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,799
better at prediction as it sees more

483
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,960
data but the actual model will not

484
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,600
change you programmed it the way it

485
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,779
should behave on the other side there's

486
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,168
a generic model and it gets programmed

487
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:40,889
by data just like programming by example

488
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:43,169
so you feed in data and the reason that

489
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:44,969
you're using that is because the problem

490
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:49,980
that you're trying to solve is too

491
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:51,299
complex now to give you an example when

492
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,820
you had in the time of speech

493
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:55,799
recognition there was a company in

494
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,450
Belgium right not a nozbe I don't know

495
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,908
if you know the company but they

496
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:03,480
approached speech recognition through

497
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:05,610
science so they try to listen to people

498
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,480
say something they analyze that and

499
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:12,539
based on that they could put up text now

500
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,579
that worked well if you were an American

501
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:18,419
or you didn't have a big accent when you

502
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:21,389
were talking to the program now this

503
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:24,239
given accuracy of about 90 percent maybe

504
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:25,589
80 between 80 and 90 percent now with

505
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:28,109
all the new technologies of deep

506
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:30,719
learning what we're doing is you just

507
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:33,989
take such a deep learning neural network

508
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:36,899
you feed it hundreds of thousands of

509
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:40,259
hours of audio that are already typed

510
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:43,018
out with text and then you feed it new

511
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:46,379
audio and it will come out with a

512
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:48,539
complete speech recognition so the text

513
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:51,629
written out and whether you're an Indian

514
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:54,029
or a French or American it will work as

515
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:55,918
well as long as the data that you fit in

516
00:22:54,029 --> 00:23:00,089
also came from all those different

517
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:04,949
people so and that works typically with

518
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:07,619
an accuracy of about 90 to 95% 98% so

519
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:09,929
there's a big jump in accuracy between

520
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:16,079
traditional machine learning and then

521
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:17,879
applying that deep learning so you might

522
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,979
tell me why don't we use deep learning

523
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:23,879
for every case then because it gives you

524
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:27,119
better accuracy it gives you much more

525
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:29,728
or much more flexibility to solve

526
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,559
difficult problems so why still create

527
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:33,299
models and use traditional machine

528
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,069
learning well they're actually a couple

529
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:39,239
of challenges with that deep learning

530
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:42,119
that are important to us so first of all

531
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:43,559
you need access to training data of

532
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,228
course if you have images if you're

533
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:48,119
Google or Facebook and in facebook

534
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:50,429
people are helping you to tag the right

535
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,499
faces on the pictures it's easy to do

536
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,690
face recognition and to put a name label

537
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:57,929
under your face because people are

538
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,629
feeding you continuously good data tag

539
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:03,239
the data so that is one big problem we

540
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:09,418
need access to data that's being tagged

541
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:12,719
good or bad now one way that you can get

542
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:14,519
that data in your network you cannot

543
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:16,109
collect just every data that passes

544
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,969
through your parameter and say that this

545
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:20,279
is good data you never know if you're

546
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:22,109
already infected or not also what comes

547
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,819
from the outside certainly not because

548
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:25,810
you don't know what is a tag data what

549
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,389
is normal data so to Train

550
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,399
cannot happen in real life in your

551
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,470
network the only way that you could do

552
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,630
some training is if you're using honey

553
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,640
pots honey pots are the only thing if

554
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,400
something comes in if a connection comes

555
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,530
in there you know that it's bad so that

556
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,620
you can give a label of bad but the good

557
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:46,720
is more difficult to learn so getting

558
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,939
access to a massive amount of data

559
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,480
specifically for your environment and

560
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,560
label it is very hard and then there's

561
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,060
also the reproducibility if you take

562
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,090
that deep learning network and you put

563
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,500
in data to train it at the end of the

564
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,330
training you will come out with a

565
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,490
configuration of the weights you know

566
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,080
all the weights that you changed on the

567
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,740
links on that network that is the actual

568
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,649
configuration of your model those

569
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,570
weights will completely change if you

570
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:20,200
just change two lines in position in

571
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:22,720
your data so if you just add one new

572
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,490
sample or you just add a few new lines

573
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,470
it can't be that your model looks

574
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,260
completely different so it's very hard

575
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,210
to transfer models based on data the

576
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,580
only way to transfer your model is to

577
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,310
transfer the architecture of the model

578
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,169
and the weight samples itself and we

579
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,290
will see there's actual applications of

580
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:47,400
this that are being used by malware

581
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:47,399
vendors where the anti-malware vendors

582
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:54,280
transparency I already told you that

583
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,350
sometimes the neural network will give

584
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,020
you strange result and you don't know

585
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,850
why and then asking yourself the

586
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,980
question why did it do that nobody can

587
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:06,070
explain to you what happened inside that

588
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,850
network and why it came out wrong to

589
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,850
give you an example

590
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:17,410
Salesforce had deep learning for a while

591
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:19,840
to do to find out what is a good

592
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:23,110
prospect and when a good prospect comes

593
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,100
out of the CRM the sales will say well I

594
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:28,899
know my environment I know my customers

595
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,320
for me this is not a good prospect tell

596
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,510
me why this is a good prospect actually

597
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,639
using the deep learning network itself

598
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:39,309
and whatever information was in there

599
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,649
they were unable to explain

600
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:43,960
I this came out as a good prospect so

601
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:46,469
what they started to do is start using

602
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,480
more traditional machine learning and

603
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,999
make a decision tree and that decision

604
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,549
tree was built by just taking the deep

605
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:56,379
learning network put some inputs to one

606
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:58,870
put some to zero looking at the

607
00:26:56,379 --> 00:27:01,629
different features on input changing

608
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:04,389
them on value and see how the decision

609
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:08,019
tree can be modeled so they actually

610
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:14,350
built a second model to explain what the

611
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:16,990
first model predicted so also we have

612
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:19,740
learning and changing environments so

613
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,320
because you have that training step a

614
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,519
model you set it up you train it once

615
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,439
it's trained you can put it in

616
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:29,470
production and do some real prediction

617
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,740
based on live traffic however if your

618
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:35,169
data changes well you need to retrain

619
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:40,480
your model it's not as such that you can

620
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:42,669
continuously learn in a model and then

621
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,950
there is learning an adversarial context

622
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:47,669
which means that I ever continuously

623
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:51,639
under attack so we cannot just put a

624
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:53,350
deep learning model out there and try to

625
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:55,090
make it learn from whatever happens out

626
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,619
there and have and think that we will

627
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,139
have a good anomaly detection in the

628
00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:01,480
future now to give you some examples of

629
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:04,149
what deep neural networks need for data

630
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,889
a state of the art speech recognition

631
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,689
we're talking about a hundred thousands

632
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:10,029
of hours of audio if you play that

633
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,279
sequentially it's about ten years of

634
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:15,460
sound that you need to train a deep

635
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:18,879
learning network face recognition needs

636
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,499
about two hundred million images so it's

637
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:22,379
not that you have enough with a couple

638
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:25,179
of samples of data

639
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:28,090
another problem is and that's a problem

640
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:29,799
that comes up quite often and will be

641
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,779
very important when you have dynamic

642
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,090
environments it's overfitting

643
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:37,929
just like with curve fitting this is a

644
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,939
perfect fit this is under fitting the

645
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:43,240
complexity of your model is not complex

646
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:46,029
enough to fit very well all the points

647
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,210
this your model was too complex and is

648
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:50,350
fitting to good it's actually

649
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,820
approximating all the noise so that

650
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:57,580
means whatever data I give here will

651
00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:00,799
be detected as an anomaly not good now

652
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,049
this depends on the diversity in your

653
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,139
data if you have more diversity in your

654
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:08,779
data you need a complex or model now

655
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:11,449
once you find a good model you drain it

656
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:13,789
so typically when you train you train

657
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,620
with data training error will always go

658
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:19,220
down because you're training with the

659
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:22,100
data now evaluation error however so 80%

660
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:25,370
of your data or 70% of your data used

661
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,320
for training 30% for evaluation this is

662
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,330
the error in the evaluation if you see

663
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,610
that it goes down and it starts to go up

664
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,340
when it starts to go up that means your

665
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:37,219
overfitting

666
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,529
because the error of trying new data is

667
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:45,769
bigger than the error from your training

668
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:48,289
set so when you see that happening the

669
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:50,269
impact that has for our network is that

670
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:53,179
when we add a new application to our

671
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,580
network we add more diversification and

672
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:57,980
our data we add a new protocol for

673
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,049
example so that means that actually our

674
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,950
model that was tuned and trained to

675
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:06,139
perfection to do a normally detection is

676
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,909
not complex enough anymore it will

677
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:11,360
suddenly sit here because now our data

678
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:13,190
has more diversity so we need to make it

679
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,620
more complex so you always have to

680
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:19,070
maintain that Network it's not something

681
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:22,039
that you can deploy autonomously so here

682
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:26,059
is the example of tie here's another

683
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:29,840
example of attack on a network so an

684
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:33,590
adversarial attack is an image on this

685
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,110
side we have here a red sports car the

686
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:39,309
model was trained on pictures from cars

687
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:42,799
recognize it as a sports car you add

688
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:45,740
some noise the perturbation to the image

689
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,809
this is the resulting image for us for

690
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,700
the humans and especially on the wall

691
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:52,250
with the projector you don't see the

692
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:56,769
difference for us is still a sports car

693
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,769
however the model thinks it's a toaster

694
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:02,149
same for Sylvester Stallone you add some

695
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,860
attacking noise becomes Gianna Reese now

696
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,740
for pictures is not that important

697
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,330
however if you drove here in Tesla this

698
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,020
will be a little bit more important

699
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:14,449
because this is an attack on an

700
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,190
autonomous vehicle system one of the

701
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,500
things that those systems need to do is

702
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:22,160
need to be able to recognize traffic

703
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:25,490
signs now this is clearly a stop sign

704
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,220
but by adding a small perturbation these

705
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,400
white and black stickers in very

706
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:33,710
specific places the system thinks that

707
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,740
this stop sign is a 45 mile-per-hour

708
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,690
sign so when your car comes up to the

709
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,940
intersection instead of slowing down

710
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:45,860
it's actually speeding up and going

711
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:49,820
through the intersection so how do

712
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:52,490
hackers use machine learning or will use

713
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,230
machine learning some of them are

714
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,600
already using it but we did not see a

715
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,640
lot of attacks in using our hackers

716
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:03,679
using machine learning hackers better

717
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,290
say malicious actors non hackers so

718
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,420
first of all they can use it to create

719
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:10,220
increasingly evasive malware they use

720
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,290
two networks we call a generative

721
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,300
adversarial networks in stew neural

722
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,220
networks pitched against each other one

723
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,649
will generate the malware the other will

724
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,900
do the detection and it will loop until

725
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:24,040
it finds a version of the malware that

726
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:28,040
cannot be detected by the second Network

727
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,480
another example breaking CAPTCHA so some

728
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,610
researchers found that using deep

729
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,970
learning they could break CAPTCHA or

730
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:37,040
solve CAPTCHA with 98% accuracy this is

731
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,320
like 48 percent better than I can do it

732
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,620
when I see those pictures most of the

733
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,540
time I fail so if you're using CAPTCHA

734
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,820
to make the distinction between a boat

735
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,680
on a human actually the body is much

736
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,379
better at it than the human so is the

737
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,170
inverse right now I'm not saying that

738
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,390
all of them are using that spearfishing

739
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,580
you do your research get information

740
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:01,100
collect that information based on that

741
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,439
you create an email to attack a person

742
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,540
that collection of information that's

743
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,210
out there on a public web can be done

744
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,950
through natural language processing

745
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,620
through deep learning through all those

746
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,080
a

747
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,239
works and when it does here's an example

748
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,480
of a human against the machine on

749
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,030
Twitter trying to get people to click on

750
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,880
a certain link the human got fifty

751
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:29,370
victims in two hours the machines got

752
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:32,640
five more than five times 275 victims an

753
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:36,570
example of using deep learning by

754
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,970
hackers and also a real act is because

755
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,110
those were white hats so they did a

756
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,820
presentation on it

757
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,590
they created the deep learning network

758
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,870
that automatically looks at the website

759
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,120
tries to find vulnerabilities and hacks

760
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:50,909
into it completely automatically they

761
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,770
didn't touch it although it found an SQL

762
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:57,270
injection and broke into the website and

763
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:59,160
they were not long experienced deep

764
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:02,220
learning engineer you know using

765
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:04,200
tensorflow and python five lines of code

766
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,290
you can write your own deep learning

767
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:12,570
network you can do your own state of the

768
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:15,090
art face recognition or attack system so

769
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:18,389
gonna go a little bit faster to this

770
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:21,960
summary so looking ahead machine

771
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,820
learning and defense so for now human

772
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,220
assisted the normally detection will be

773
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,909
the number one application because you

774
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:32,520
can use that and then using that you can

775
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:35,310
reduce to a lower number of events and

776
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,168
then have a human expert after that that

777
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,750
treats those events because you cannot

778
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:41,489
always count on the deep learning system

779
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,070
what comes out of it however deep

780
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:46,620
learning can make more complex

781
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:48,780
associations and data than any human can

782
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,089
remember they're good at processing data

783
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,090
very good at it we are not that good at

784
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:57,120
it so they can find much better complex

785
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:59,460
associations technologies that already

786
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,290
use it pattern matching for example is

787
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,910
already using it it's like face

788
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,490
recognition pattern matching in

789
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:07,799
antivirus for example they use deep

790
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:10,470
neural networks they train it in the

791
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,420
cloud massive amount of malware copy of

792
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,089
the weight vectors to smaller to the

793
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,260
same model that runs on your PC but it

794
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,990
doesn't have to go through the training

795
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:22,109
step so it needs much less compute much

796
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,640
less memory much less storage you just

797
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:24,330
copy the model and then you run it in

798
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,350
life

799
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:30,509
that's how those AI based malware works

800
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:32,790
malware research and an analysis we sort

801
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,490
of presentation on the Android so you

802
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:39,620
can use that to actually go into malware

803
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,620
classify them bring them together in

804
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:46,140
case of the threat landscape next few

805
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,080
years we will see increasingly automated

806
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,700
attacks automation where the threat

807
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,770
actors are still creating their own

808
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,060
attacks they're just automating their

809
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:58,890
attacks and attacking more targets they

810
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:02,070
will also get better efficiency at

811
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:05,220
evasion and if you think that today we

812
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,480
are already facing lots of threats I can

813
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,299
assure you in the next couple of years

814
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,520
as they get more automated we will see

815
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,500
more and more threats that goes faster

816
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,300
spread faster whenever there is a new

817
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,850
vulnerability published there will be

818
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,670
faster to abuse it and to use it for

819
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,380
more targets and then further outs

820
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,480
I believe that threat actors will

821
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,640
actually just become the engineers of

822
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,800
the machine they will know to the actual

823
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,680
attacks anymore they will just design

824
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:42,540
builds dai machine and then they will

825
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:45,540
just maintain it thank you so thank you

826
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,640
I think it was a great summary of the

827
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:50,700
state of the art of machine learning

828
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,609
which is not an obvious topic so I guess

829
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:57,210
you can go through the slides through

830
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:59,790
those interesting slides afterwards so

831
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:09,380
if any of you guys have question about

832
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:13,190
this thank you that was excellent I

833
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,740
learned more than I expected

834
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,180
you think about that image recognition

835
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,060
not just the errors that can be

836
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,399
introduced but the basic ability to do

837
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:26,040
image recognition it's clear that we're

838
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,950
using a lot more watts of power to do it

839
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:32,759
with silicon and then with the human

840
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:35,549
brain and so it feels a little bit like

841
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,630
brute force now in the old days before

842
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,390
we had

843
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:42,060
this much compute power available a lot

844
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,910
of researchers were looking at less

845
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,920
brute force e ways to do this as natural

846
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,560
language processing one of the examples

847
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,900
that you brought up is there any hope

848
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,790
that anybody is gonna work on that again

849
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,580
now that we have all these computes and

850
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,430
we can melt ice caps or is this our

851
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:02,040
future

852
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:04,140
well I 100% agree this is like the brute

853
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,120
force way of attacking problems right

854
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,920
you take a lots of amount of data you up

855
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,009
my computing to it you create a model

856
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,380
and then you go and use it now actually

857
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,120
what we do see in those models when you

858
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,980
would look at some of those models and

859
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,040
there's nice simulations online to see

860
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,170
that in images they find features and

861
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,300
that's actually what the research is on

862
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,640
image recognition did before what they

863
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,710
did before is actually find features and

864
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,230
images and then bastes try to filter

865
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,760
those features so for me actually in the

866
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,270
future it can be an interaction between

867
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,980
both because before they had a very hard

868
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,620
time finding those features and I took

869
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,010
maybe a couple of months to find the

870
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,900
right features to detect an object but

871
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,810
using deep learning by just putting

872
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,700
brute amounts brute force on it you can

873
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,840
detect those features and you don't see

874
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,600
it on the output you see it in the

875
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,520
network itself you have some of those

876
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,890
those images that come back in the

877
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,170
neurons themselves and then you will see

878
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:03,299
that you have that specific angle or

879
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,400
that specific feature so you could use

880
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,650
combination of both of them and actually

881
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,350
all that deep learning that there's

882
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,820
still a lot of machine learning and

883
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:14,220
cleverness that comes in front of it

884
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,410
it's not like you have that model I I

885
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,569
simply oversimplified it by saying you

886
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,240
just take the model throw data in it and

887
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,950
how to come something magic yeah you

888
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,569
have to process the data you have to

889
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,310
find the right features because some

890
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,670
features make sense other features make

891
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:31,259
no sense they try to reduce the

892
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,720
dimensionality to make the problem

893
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,150
simpler because as you said it's lots of

894
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,919
heart of computer we can throw lots of

895
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,360
computer that but sometimes this is even

896
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,550
too slow if you have millions of

897
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,980
features so there's lots of research

898
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:46,050
going into the fact of reducing that and

899
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,810
there comes the human ability of

900
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,370
reasoning and also bringing in the right

901
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,380
features doing

902
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:54,330
the right pre-processing of data before

903
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,120
it goes into the deep Learning Network

904
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:58,620
so that's part I did not talk about but

905
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,549
that part still contains a lot of what

906
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:05,600
you are referring to so maybe you have

907
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,600
time for last question

908
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:18,000
thank you do you know any commercially

909
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,560
available network intrusion or open

910
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,580
source network intrusion detection

911
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,080
system that is using deep learning I

912
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:30,690
would say they are all looking into it

913
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:34,259
and so machine learning has been used a

914
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,910
lot already the deep learning things and

915
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,040
yeah I had some slides but I skipped it

916
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:41,960
the actual applications of it

917
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:44,310
so Microsoft so false and I know other

918
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,900
anti-malware vendors are also using it

919
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:49,500
they're already using that deep learning

920
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:52,290
they use models in the cloud with

921
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,320
terabytes of data or malware they train

922
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:56,970
the model copy off the weights copy

923
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,670
those ways to the exact same model that

924
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:04,649
runs as a client and then use that to do

925
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:07,170
malware detection we use it for example

926
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:09,240
traditional machine learning you can

927
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,380
build a model you can easily detect

928
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,819
unknown DDoS attacks like syn attacks

929
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:18,300
but then again there's some attacks that

930
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,920
are so complex that you cannot just

931
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,420
detect them with traditional machine

932
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,750
learning so you need deep learning

933
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,550
now deep learning you need lots of data

934
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,350
lots of data when customers data is not

935
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,940
good enough because that customer might

936
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:32,370
be already infected too at the backdoor

937
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,350
so what you need is crowdsourcing take

938
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:38,069
data from many customers bring them into

939
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:40,410
the cloud anonymized preferably yeah

940
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:43,020
bring them in the cloud process them

941
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:45,120
there build a model and based on that

942
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,620
model you can get new data from a

943
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,210
customer run it through the model and

944
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,069
then you can detect if it's an attack or

945
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,720
not and then you can feedback that

946
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,820
information through threat intelligence

947
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,160
so a lot of threat intelligence feeds

948
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,200
that you see are actually already based

949
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,029
on deep learning there's already a lot

950
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,618
of deep learning out there but most of

951
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,839
them is processing in the cloud and

952
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:07,839
- either threat intelligence or copying

953
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:12,308
of the vectors resists in real time on

954
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,089
site that answer the question so thank

955
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:14,980
you very much

956
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:18,038
Pascal I guess it's a really broad topic

957
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:21,130
so we can discuss about this during

958
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:26,079
hours but unfortunately now we have to

959
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:30,309
switch to the next speaker which is the

960
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,940
last of the day so thank you again it

961
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:34,179
was good

962
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,179
[Applause]
