1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:12,190
oh hi everyone I hope you all had a good

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,190
lunch and you're not too sleepy so let's

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,560
welcome metric urea who is going to talk

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,800
about Andrews Rebecca's search so a

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,038
search service of metadata related to

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,789
Android malware so Madrick is currently

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,710
a PhD student as well as teacher

8
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:34,360
assistant at the University of

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:37,600
Luxembourg so I give you the floor okay

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,370
so thank you so yes so the topic of my

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,650
presentation will be on on the whate

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,540
malware so I know that it's not a topic

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,610
that may interest all of you so first

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,519
let me ask who is interested in his

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,590
company or the person Arabi on on the

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,440
weight the on weight application like

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:56,380
for pen testing reverse that's what I

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,930
thought okay I tried to keep my up

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,440
confession interesting so first let me

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,940
hear a bit about me so I'm a doctoral

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,689
researcher and teacher assistant as

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,749
investor for example my main I'm also

23
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:13,329
fillin I work with data scientist mentor

24
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:17,649
at open classroom clear loosie loosie to

25
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:20,469
0 or in French my topic my thesis topic

26
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:23,770
is focused on on with security machine

27
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:25,949
running and big data and especially I'm

28
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,479
interested in dissecting and

29
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,509
understanding the behavior of on the

30
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,569
Weidman well I added some some underwear

31
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:39,399
to my social account and my my

32
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:41,740
I called repository so about my team we

33
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,979
I work as a researcher at SN T so it's

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,289
centered at Luxembourg which stand for

35
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,810
interdisciplinary Center for security

36
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:52,959
reliability and Trust our Center is

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,289
focused on creating partnership with

38
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,950
industrial partners and so to enter

39
00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:01,600
industry or problem within with this

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,200
Center we have we are working in a

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,630
research group called Salalah which is

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,500
specialized in security in soft relation

43
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,940
r is

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,670
and and yeah and radiation we have a

45
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,109
team of about 50 people and you can find

46
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,769
the link here in the presentation to

47
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,350
visit and women this team we have a sub

48
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:27,670
team which is specialized in on auto

49
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:30,130
with on weights acuity so our array of

50
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,149
expertise of Vietnam in our wave and

51
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:37,000
grab detection and also static analysis

52
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,250
so we have some good Tier one

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,760
publication that we publish at research

54
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,459
conference like Hughes Knicks if we e TN

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,870
and poppin

56
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,940
now let's discuss about the program so

57
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,100
prime I want to present today is as a

58
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,290
publication of Android malware and as

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,910
Bonilla is saying here one does not

60
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,859
simply prevents application of on with

61
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,209
malware when didn't survive in the movie

62
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:05,260
but I want to to do back up some numbers

63
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:07,450
so that the first two points come up

64
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,989
directly from the blog of Android

65
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,350
solidity

66
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:14,080
in 2008 there was 3.5 million

67
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:18,700
application on Google Play and the same

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,980
year the team they removed 700,000

69
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,649
application in welcome still as I'm full

70
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,149
or as malware which is a lot and by the

71
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,010
way does not include the application

72
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,690
they're currently not detected so it

73
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,890
just one that they are currently able to

74
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:36,550
detects and if I and if I add a report

75
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,700
from data so computer company they say

76
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:44,560
that there is 344 new mobile application

77
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:47,589
which discover every every hour which is

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,760
a lot so there is no way when you man

79
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,709
can analyze this amount of of malware it

80
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,350
will be fully basically transformed

81
00:03:53,709 --> 00:04:01,150
every people on the world is reverse

82
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,320
engineer so in were former combat to try

83
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,350
to understand the cause of this problem

84
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,079
I think we have to think about the

85
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,959
process how do we create new número are

86
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,540
created and how they are they are

87
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,090
understand for me it's come down to an

88
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,599
automation problem because in this fight

89
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,469
we have a clear advantage and we do not

90
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,840
on one end the attack

91
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,700
we are able to with some script to

92
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,530
automate the creation of new malware

93
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,570
they can repackage it off escape the

94
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,239
code and use a new technique to try to

95
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,440
avoid current detection the problem is

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,540
on the other hand we are lacking

97
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,980
resource to analyze this amount of code

98
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,320
and it's more difficult for us to

99
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,930
analyze because we all the thing we do

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,180
to try to bypass our current security

101
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,320
measure we have no way to keep up with

102
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,750
the current rate of propagation and

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,659
finally and this is importance compared

104
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,600
to other area where machine learning can

105
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,570
be used to automate this task security

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,180
is one of the most difficult one compare

107
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,950
it for me as the medical field like if

108
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,890
you are on Amazon and you want to

109
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,570
amazement recommend some products I mean

110
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,099
if you don't buy the product it's not a

111
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:14,120
problem they lose a bit of money but

112
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,460
there is no grave consequence on our on

113
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,520
our side if for example we are we miss

114
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,409
even one malicious file or on the other

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,210
end we block it it's possible it's

116
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,940
possible but it has consequences like

117
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,520
some people doesn't get his report some

118
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,990
person can be fired or you can just grab

119
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,390
the whole infrastructure of your company

120
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,580
so that's why it's remote difficult for

121
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:38,750
us to provide fully automated the

122
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,979
solution since we have no cannot

123
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,500
guarantee the behavior of the

124
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,020
application the same if you go to a

125
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,370
robot doctor would you trust is the

126
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,799
opinion so the first question you will

127
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,200
ask is what do you think is this disease

128
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,200
of this one and VC and currently are not

129
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,930
at this stage so for me to try to keep

130
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,520
up with with with the attacker we need

131
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,440
to develop even more automation and data

132
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,520
automation and also to share information

133
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:07,730
but we are present to you on topic and

134
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,349
such so from its part of the solution

135
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,540
what you are doing here is we are

136
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,840
providing the Security Committee with an

137
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,810
online service that allow us to search

138
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:22,909
metadata related to on wide application

139
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:26,450
so as our current service is is based on

140
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,160
1 million malicious application and we

141
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,990
provide a read-only access which means

142
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,419
that it's not like mist where people can

143
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,030
share information we collect the malware

144
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,130
reprocess them

145
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,530
and you can issue queries on our system

146
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,270
to get information so the use case that

147
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,890
we found could be useful for the

148
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,799
community will be first to try to

149
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,930
identify application which are sharing

150
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,420
the same components if you don t five at

151
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,000
the class or file or method is involved

152
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,940
in to some malicious activity your first

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,830
Direction will be to check on on this

154
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:01,150
kind of database what are the other

155
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:03,460
application but use this indicator to

156
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,620
try to block it you try you can try also

157
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:09,520
to be a bit more advanced and also to to

158
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,070
avert to assess the trends of of

159
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,620
malicious artifact which our goal is to

160
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,599
see if by something which is really

161
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,780
common or if something something is

162
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,150
falling out of of the trend and finally

163
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,260
our goal with this platform is to create

164
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:28,239
tool but other people can use to create

165
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,650
automated solution so if you want to

166
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,190
know more this is the link to the

167
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:40,539
documentation of the website it's a loop

168
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:42,100
that we needed lu / epoch a search is if

169
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,530
some information that you're currently

170
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,610
indexing so the metadata varies we

171
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,190
forefathers would not know it I try to

172
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,200
explain on natto in application is just

173
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,760
a zip file its own Fu K fight just to

174
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:01,030
zip with a bit of Java metadata so it

175
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,700
contains files so it can be images of

176
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,590
our shell scripts and we get information

177
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,340
like the name pavan's nature of these

178
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,979
files

179
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,080
we also retrieve some meta information

180
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,200
like the Marquette's origin of the

181
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,630
application this its size and also the

182
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,810
package name associated to it

183
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,760
we also reports on to various levels and

184
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,500
here we already integrate with one of

185
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,840
our solution which try to come up with a

186
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:31,750
single family per malicious application

187
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,280
we also get you you also get to develop

188
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,559
certificates so we'll create the

189
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,309
application with certificates so the

190
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,289
issue on and the signature of the

191
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,179
disasters indicates and finally the most

192
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,360
important thing some code objects which

193
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,550
are methods field plus everything you

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,640
can find in Java

195
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,829
so we also have strings invokes the goal

196
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,770
is to create as much possible come today

197
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,870
- for signature and for finding rated

198
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,310
application and your stuff some manifest

199
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,250
information which is specific to annoyed

200
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,040
this other dimension the activities

201
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,850
intense and so on I tried to represent

202
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,240
on this on this picture here so how's

203
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:16,410
the things be representin visually so

204
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,350
it's like a graph so Renaud will be the

205
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,959
application and this rectangular one are

206
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,350
the components and the interesting thing

207
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,960
here like a social network is to try to

208
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:31,790
study the relation what application

209
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:36,150
include what artifact and vice versa

210
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:38,640
okay our brief we discuss the

211
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:42,360
architecture so it's based on elastic

212
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,540
search so it's full full search text

213
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,520
engine that we use to Index this

214
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,490
information so we use it to store

215
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,579
document and indexed by attributes we

216
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,890
process the extraction of metadata for

217
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,280
multiplication with Python using salary

218
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:01,189
so we distribute it across our cluster

219
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,740
and we present

220
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:08,100
elasticsearch api of apache where we

221
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:11,520
enforce some basic application so all

222
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:16,860
this is diagram just not but this system

223
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:19,110
is osted by University and good I would

224
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,020
say research sure it's the best default

225
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,580
so don't expect to have some SLA night

226
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,990
night night desta Levis that's the case

227
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,410
we try to do our best to endure

228
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,510
everybody's traffic and it's possible

229
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:35,370
but sometimes the fire or will not keep

230
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,990
up of these things now I just want to

231
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,480
explain a bit more how you could access

232
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,760
this API so we provide a little

233
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,490
authorization mechanism which is based

234
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,290
on HTTP basic code so here you just have

235
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:52,350
to send the your email an API key over

236
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,810
HTTP by adding others and it will

237
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:58,080
authenticate the requests was not too

238
00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:01,640
two complex you first need to encode

239
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,440
your key with makest base64 which is a

240
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,020
simple algorithm to send things of us

241
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,580
internet an infant to get a key you

242
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,699
first have to send us an email to oh no

243
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,400
sue our bastard Lu will send you the key

244
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,570
and then you will be able to send this

245
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:23,339
with the 4000 encoded key with each

246
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,839
request to get information for the

247
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,910
access method so the nice thing with

248
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,279
elasticsearch it what is based on the

249
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,900
rest api which provide you with JSON

250
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,760
document so it should be familiar with

251
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,000
everybody which use an API over the

252
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,550
Internet so any HTTP clients or any

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,779
reason client can process information

254
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:49,469
from the API some example GQ curl backed

255
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:51,779
an HTTP HTTP HTTP and Python request now

256
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,880
I will provide you with some example so

257
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:58,170
the goal is to show you what you can do

258
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,300
with the with our service and as the

259
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,569
plague visits this is only to me to type

260
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,880
in Python to get access to it so once

261
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,350
you get you type this free line and you

262
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,089
have the key for sure you will be able

263
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,550
to access and issue some quest

264
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,550
I also added the link if we want to know

265
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:17,370
to create some more powerful elastic

266
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:20,010
search queries so there is nine example

267
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,950
I will not explain all of them in detail

268
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,480
and for those who are not so interesting

269
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,190
about the example it's interesting to

270
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,990
know bit more how elastic search work if

271
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,790
you want for example to integrated to a

272
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:36,780
sim solution so this is how he look like

273
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:39,990
so we need to provide a path to the to

274
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:42,900
our metadata index which is called

275
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,490
apk index and this is a simplest query

276
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,079
which simply returns involved document

277
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:52,200
which are currently index one you can

278
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,480
also create saw some queries like in SQL

279
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,310
this one so the query is a recent

280
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,940
document is sent with the request and

281
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:04,260
this one is returning all the family who

282
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:07,070
match was on tavares say it's come from

283
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,069
the add new family

284
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:12,040
you can also get a single document so it

285
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,800
will retrieve all the metadata related

286
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,069
to the application so below you can see

287
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,130
the list of metadata so that's what I

288
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,199
mentioned previous right so next one

289
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:28,389
multi document it's possible to retrieve

290
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:29,769
the document in bulk so okay this one is

291
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:31,600
a bit more interesting because it

292
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,010
creates a logical operation so here we

293
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,560
are interested by every application

294
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:39,850
which contain a Chinese translation at

295
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,949
which include dot SH file so when I was

296
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,649
at the unc-tv request took something

297
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:48,430
like less than five seconds to to return

298
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:51,310
and that's a nice way to gather if you

299
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,930
have some suspicions about country of an

300
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:59,500
IP and zones a good way to to get

301
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:01,839
potentially dangerous application you

302
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,300
can also do some analytics similar to a

303
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,779
group by in SQL so here we are computing

304
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,750
the total size of of a set or a PK I

305
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:14,860
think I made I think it's something like

306
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:19,180
ten terabytes of applique but we can't

307
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,829
leave your hosting and we and so you can

308
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,449
also create diverse type of queries like

309
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:27,279
this you can also retrieve applications

310
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,540
with like I associated to the

311
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,810
application if you are looking for

312
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,480
example for domain like if you are

313
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,609
working in a bank you can say what are

314
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,290
the application which includes domain in

315
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,610
the package limited useful for example

316
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:47,430
if you want to retrieve the application

317
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,430
and try to impersonate your own company

318
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:53,199
this one is a bit complex just you are

319
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,390
interested by that there is something

320
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,149
called the score API in elastic last

321
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,550
retrieve a lot of data efficiently so if

322
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,709
at some point you are saying okay maybe

323
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,439
I don't have enough result or taking too

324
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:07,719
much time and score API and if it

325
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,410
doesn't work send me any members moving

326
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,480
and the last one this one is useful for

327
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,949
example for our researcher when we want

328
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,050
to study for example some specific

329
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:18,449
features so you can for example select

330
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,630
every application that we are

331
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:26,010
Hosting which contains the ring the

332
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:28,589
red-hot state commission all right so I

333
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,540
finished with the example so now we just

334
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,089
present what we also intend to do in the

335
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,709
future with our service first thing I

336
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,380
want to do is to include my application

337
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:40,138
we we divided it into three three stage

338
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,000
the first stage was to import every

339
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,560
manager application and with the most

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,720
important features so what we are

341
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,388
currently does that you are currently in

342
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,430
now we also want to include the benign

343
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:52,470
application in our set so in total about

344
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:57,630
seven million application which account

345
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,250
for sixty terabyte of data and finally

346
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,310
burst want to include national features

347
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,980
that help other people to create model

348
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,930
to detect this kind of application we

349
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,209
also want to provide over service on top

350
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,839
of apt search and I will detail in the

351
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:15,000
next slide and finally we also at some

352
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,980
point of I did the service called

353
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,399
ethical eyes to provide the riving

354
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,940
inspection of of applications which was

355
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,029
returning more data which we are

356
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,709
currently serving with services

357
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,050
currently broken but if I have some time

358
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:34,380
I tried to repair it and to make it

359
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:38,760
available again if people are interested

360
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:42,120
by integrating IP have search into their

361
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,010
products you can you can contact us for

362
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,620
example be interested to integrate this

363
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,850
solution with miss and some of my

364
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:53,010
colleague already in the discussion to

365
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:55,649
try to do so I give you our simulated

366
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,180
walk something I did in the past again

367
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:59,610
to try to understand better on Whitman

368
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:04,500
where one of my first walk was to try to

369
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:07,230
unify the Lebel of of antivirus report

370
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,030
so when you receive a not something like

371
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,510
you know various total report which

372
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:15,119
contains labelled for many antivirus the

373
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,770
org or get a different name and we have

374
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,809
a different syntax different semantics

375
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,000
so the goal of our tool is to try to say

376
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,129
ok this malware it's come from this

377
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,770
family if there is some common terms

378
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,689
like one that one say it's called a PG

379
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,070
app and the web sites for a do they

380
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:32,610
always occur in the same

381
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,929
we say the same application so we we say

382
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:39,449
it's a synonym we are I also created

383
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:42,780
stays which is some statistical metric

384
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,610
to try to build or qualify on malware

385
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,620
data set here the goal was for

386
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,840
researcher to guarantee but the data

387
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,169
they were using to train machine on in

388
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,570
model was not bias for example by

389
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,270
including a set of antivirus not too

390
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,520
different from the rest of the set so we

391
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,830
try to answer to evaluate here some

392
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,490
question like do some interior detection

393
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:08,879
a very to generic of what has the

394
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:11,540
confidence level and also is there some

395
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,470
similar detection across antivirus

396
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,659
finally we are currently working on a

397
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,360
new approach called epigraph our goal is

398
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,070
to try to find the discriminate

399
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,860
component so the component which appear

400
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:25,439
in a single Maria family but which do

401
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,110
not appear elsewhere so we say that this

402
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,840
feature are characteristic of a given

403
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,120
family and that we are interesting as

404
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,939
the first path to locate the malicious

405
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,790
behavior of Unknowing application so it

406
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,540
is continuous yet if it's if is

407
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,770
interesting

408
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:45,750
let me know so in conclusion on also

409
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,940
epic a search it's an online service but

410
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,070
people in the community can use to

411
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,070
retrieve information about on load

412
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:56,580
application our goal is to try to enable

413
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:58,970
the committee to to get easy access to

414
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,919
auto in malware with butanol standing of

415
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:05,370
characteristic and what do they and how

416
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,400
do we arm where user this data set is

417
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,290
available to every researcher and some

418
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,350
small condition you can check them on

419
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,690
the web websites and for industry actors

420
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,929
you will need to contact us this is on

421
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,760
the case to on case by case basis but we

422
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:24,950
already have some collaboration with

423
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,550
partners to integrate on those results

424
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,460
that's it

425
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm open to any question I just saw but

426
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,140
you have a piece be interested bit by

427
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,600
enjoy the work and buy the thing we are

428
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,600
doing as research awesome thank you

429
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,329
[Applause]

430
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:53,210
thank you for the nice presentation I

431
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,929
was just checking the website to buy the

432
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:59,480
container and I saw on the axis that it

433
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,520
was quite complex to actually get acces

434
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,400
to the service and international

435
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,750
something about institutions and

436
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,240
government position and stuff like that

437
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,450
so is it possible for someone who wants

438
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:15,920
to play around or check to the taxes in

439
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:18,440
an easier way maybe so it's you have to

440
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,570
send us an email I think it's best to

441
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,700
discuss visa via an email because it's

442
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:26,990
true we cannot it would be irresponsible

443
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,910
for us to send malware to people without

444
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,370
any plague visits so currently our

445
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,720
condition is we it has to be for

446
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,780
research sure it has to be sent by

447
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,770
people coming from an institution like

448
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,899
so in your example

449
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,660
so all away all unless it you like this

450
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,480
and then they need to agree but we will

451
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,830
not judge them themself and so on so the

452
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,650
best thing is to send us an email and

453
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:57,340
you can discuss how can we share the

454
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:57,340
information yeah thank you anyone else

455
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:08,510
okay so I do have a few questions

456
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:10,760
so assuming I am malware analyst and I

457
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:14,450
guess covered like strange things with

458
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,629
this on rosu am i able to download the

459
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,570
samples yes so I didn't mention it but

460
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,820
on osoo it's part of a larger service

461
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,090
but none of my critic created and where

462
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,310
we are 7 million application but what

463
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:31,340
can then load the thing is previously we

464
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:34,700
didn't have any any system to do some

465
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,129
plate to do some queries like I want I'm

466
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,710
uninterested my application but use root

467
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,150
Bluetooth for Wi-Fi for instance so yes

468
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,430
you can use and also to download the

469
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,860
application and and trying to understand

470
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,980
how to

471
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,590
- quite a solution as you may see this

472
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:53,350
was most most that's was tailored for

473
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,260
researchers but if you have encountered

474
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:59,260
some climb in the company I think it's

475
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:04,929
also interesting source to get infamous

476
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:07,929
evil samples again I have a question

477
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:11,590
about this new feature that you want to

478
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:15,690
implement so mainly the machine learning

479
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:18,070
ones will this information be available

480
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,519
through this interface like I don't know

481
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,379
the cluster ization all these

482
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:29,139
classifications that you will do will it

483
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:32,370
be available to this this search it will

484
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:34,689
be available I think yes but mostly like

485
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:38,229
documents so which means I will be able

486
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,700
to to get the results but I don't think

487
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,600
it would be too valuable to make some

488
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,360
search on it because here I have to go

489
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,809
back with robots I was most interesting

490
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,189
by what I call binary features which is

491
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,260
something you could say is it in the

492
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,049
application yes or no like a file the

493
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,840
file is here or is not here but for a

494
00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:01,210
machine learning algorithm we are most

495
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,668
interested by a computed matrix for

496
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,679
example what is the total number of

497
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:07,659
premiership which is the things not too

498
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,600
useful for analysts but if you want to

499
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:16,389
create some behavioral model where it's

500
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:18,820
interesting so it will not be searchable

501
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:20,769
like the video that you have here but

502
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,320
there will be available with the same

503
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:26,169
interface again that's the best default

504
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,769
so it develop our time on the time I

505
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:32,289
have to allocate to this to this ok and

506
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:35,669
my last question is about this underlies

507
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:39,669
is is this something which analyzed the

508
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:43,600
epoch is dynamically or is just static

509
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:45,549
analysis of the dough for first month

510
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,889
it's only static analysis we try to

511
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:51,129
create a service with which could

512
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:52,928
include many type of analysis tool knock

513
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,210
on door guard for instance and return

514
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:58,809
its results so I think to

515
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:02,710
advance to over non solution I can't

516
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:04,029
remember the one but the one where a web

517
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,610
application you can quite a lot of

518
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:09,789
information but on with application

519
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:13,000
forest our goal was provide more of a

520
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:15,340
wide set of analysis but necessary to

521
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,520
compete of the best analysis compared to

522
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:24,490
over existing solution okay so I

523
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:31,000
finished with my question so if anyone

524
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:32,020
else has some questions no okay so thank

525
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,549
you again

526
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,549
Matariki for your attention
