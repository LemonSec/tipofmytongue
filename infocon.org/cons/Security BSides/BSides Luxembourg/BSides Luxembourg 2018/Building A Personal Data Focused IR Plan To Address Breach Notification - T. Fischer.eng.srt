1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,470
so the background to that is that I've

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,360
actually worked a long time in endpoint

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,410
protection and specifically working on

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,899
looking at what the target asset is of

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,730
an attacker be it insider or outsider

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,350
and the other things I do the reason he

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,090
said one and only is because I run

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,910
besides London I'm one of the directors

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,600
to be size London I very active as I

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,090
double let's say I you know I do a lot

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,070
of things all over the place

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,810
don't follow my Twitter right now unless

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,360
you'd like to hear

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,780
sarcasm rants and complaints about

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,970
Briggs it that's why I'm wearing the

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,180
yellow thing because I need to leave the

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,269
UK by the end by next year I'm not

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,680
English so let's get to the gist of the

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,980
talk I am going to change the format

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,649
slightly I store going to do the 15

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,390
minutes of feedback in to audience

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,750
feedback but I'm gonna reverse it I'm

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,640
gonna ask the audience questions just

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,409
get your feedback on what you're doing

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,700
with your instant response plan so how

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,350
many of you are actually doing insert

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,639
response in this room do you do insert

28
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,729
response quite a few Thanks

29
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:21,029
so as you know we have a beautiful thing

30
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,009
in Euro ecology DPR I love the gdpr but

31
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:24,600
it's not only Europe right we're seeing

32
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,219
a lot more legislation come out we've

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,139
got the Turkish data protection law

34
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,240
which is almost equivalence of the GDP

35
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:32,279
are there's bit one big difference if

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,779
you violate the Turkish data protection

37
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:38,340
law you go to jail okay you don't want

38
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:40,920
to go to jail and in the Turkish jail

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,479
you've got the New York Department of

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,270
Financial Services that also has a

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,549
cybersecurity regulation and as a curve

42
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,880
when your Privacy Act 20 to 18

43
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,130
does anybody know what the similarities

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:02:00,389
between this one and that one is between

45
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:04,229
NY DFS and gdpr it's a number 72 do you

46
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:05,818
know what 72 is 72 hours right the

47
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,749
amount of time that you have to report a

48
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,750
data breach

49
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:11,820
you also have roadmap legislation coming

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,560
into play South Korea is preparing one

51
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,989
Japan and Canada are preparing some as

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,319
well Japan and Canada are doing it I

53
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,260
think

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,208
Dillons on the list as well because they

55
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,499
want to do trade with Europe and Europe

56
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,139
is starting to insist but if you're

57
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:27,749
going to doing trade with us you need to

58
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,129
have a data protection plan in play so

59
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:31,650
this is becoming really important for

60
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,689
incident responders because there is

61
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,849
requirements on understanding where data

62
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,290
breach comes into play and this is the

63
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,730
gist of what I've been doing a lot with

64
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,909
with companies as I've been talking

65
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,450
about how do you actually focus your

66
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:47,310
incident response because so we're

67
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,319
focusing on a GDP off this top story

68
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,109
we're focusing on the GDP off of this

69
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,540
talk because it's more or less what we

70
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:56,579
need to talk about so we have different

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,260
flavors of insert response but one

72
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,000
commonality between each each and some

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,870
flavor of this response is that you're

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,459
focusing on the who the how and what

75
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,319
they've done to your environment you're

76
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,719
not really focusing on the consequences

77
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,238
initially right you focus on the

78
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,579
consequences a lot more down the path so

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,239
the one on the left is you know the this

80
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:20,729
is the typical if you do if you do your

81
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,400
sans Jack cih that's the insolent

82
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,290
response loot from sands this is I think

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,829
if I remember right stuff is basically

84
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,298
based on this one and this is this is

85
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,530
we're seeing more and more of this does

86
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:36,479
anybody know what the autoloader loop is

87
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,629
1 2 3 4 so the outer loop is actually a

88
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:42,000
military incident response type thing

89
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:44,220
essentially you have four stages observe

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,500
so like you're trying to understand and

91
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,720
identify something that's going on you

92
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,099
evaluate what's going on to make to

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,299
decide on how you're going to take care

94
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,429
of it

95
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,709
that's when you get to decide you choose

96
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,620
that types of actions that you're going

97
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,759
to take into play and you act so that's

98
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,129
when you actually implement your

99
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,888
response so we're seeing a lot more of

100
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:07,259
that and if you go to the US a lot of a

101
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:10,650
lot more and more of the u.s. since that

102
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:13,698
responders are talking about this the

103
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,459
other loop I kind of stick to the left

104
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:19,409
because I like the left it's simple

105
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,810
because this one actually over it's like

106
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:23,940
very simply described as Oda

107
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,960
it's actually quite complex internally

108
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,840
because there's a whole bunch of other

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,210
loops inside each loop inside each step

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,520
the preparation identification

111
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,260
containment eradication recovery and

112
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,330
lessons learnt is simple enough to

113
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:42,659
remember and it's simple enough to do in

114
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:44,190
a very process driven method so are you

115
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,950
ready to actually talk to the data

116
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,419
breach and to report to your day no

117
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,940
authority that's the problem that we

118
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,340
have if you think about what do we need

119
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,190
to do there's a really important part

120
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,380
which is the 72 hours to report if

121
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,060
you're only looking at and that's the

122
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,460
traditional way of only looking at the

123
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,470
consequences of the breach towards the

124
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,770
end you're not going to hit that 72 hour

125
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,720
target and it's really important because

126
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,590
it's when you become aware of the breach

127
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,110
right so if you've detected an incident

128
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,609
that's when the clock starts if you've

129
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,660
detected an event that could potentially

130
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,889
lead to an incident that could

131
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,310
potentially lead to data breach that's

132
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:25,590
when the clock started I'm gonna get

133
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,930
back to this line later but a breach

134
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,260
isn't just exfiltration under most of

135
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,850
these legislations you need to notify

136
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,950
the data subject so that means you need

137
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,140
to have an understanding of who's

138
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,849
impacted in terms of whose personal data

139
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,520
that you have is going to be impacted by

140
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,350
this breach but there's one important

141
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,469
thing but a lot of people didn't realize

142
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,330
is you know you hear a lot oh like the

143
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,280
Facebook is the recent Facebook incident

144
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,710
right the one with the API key that was

145
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,820
leaked and some of the ICA some of the

146
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,010
data protection authorities are looking

147
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,320
into it they won't get fined I'm telling

148
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:02,760
you this because it's not personal data

149
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,950
number one number two what is an API how

150
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,099
is an API key gonna hurt them hurt a

151
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:11,070
data subject this is the point is that

152
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,580
you need to report you need to report a

153
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:16,349
data breach if there's like it's likely

154
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,840
to risk the rights and the freedoms of

155
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,820
the data subject and a lot of people

156
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,349
miss this out right so they think well

157
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,659
we have to report all data breaches you

158
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,430
know you don't I so it's very important

159
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,710
to understand the consequences what

160
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,970
might happen when you actually lose a

161
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,090
personal data

162
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:38,140
so before we can actually get down to

163
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,940
detecting what personal data is in our

164
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,300
breach we need to understand what

165
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,310
personal data is and this is where a lot

166
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:50,650
of companies fail okay

167
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:53,500
because gdpr defines it and interprets

168
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,409
it so it's defined in article 4 if you'd

169
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,090
like to treat to read long documents but

170
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,480
the important part in GDP is reading the

171
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,830
recitals and as when X number of

172
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,150
recitals would actually define personal

173
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:09,370
data to sum it up it's basically any

174
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:12,729
information relating to identified or

175
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,410
identifiable natural person right so any

176
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,290
information that will allow you to

177
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,570
identify somebody that can be anything

178
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:24,210
from physical characteristics to

179
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:27,700
electronic communications to anything

180
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,570
but it's directly or indirectly so this

181
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,039
is where the IP address comes in I can

182
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,530
use an IP address to indirectly to

183
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,330
identify a person I can use a postcode

184
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,030
right there in directly identifier a

185
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,890
person and this is where you'll see a

186
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,510
lot of people argue as how much personal

187
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,750
data do you actually need before you can

188
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:50,740
identify a person so for example I'll

189
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:55,810
use the postcode again the postcode in

190
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,700
some countries is a city or a town in

191
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,460
some places a postcode can actually

192
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,560
identify an individual house like in the

193
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,270
UK there's certain parts of the UK where

194
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,850
UK postcode is actually probably one

195
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,799
house so if you're if I have that one

196
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,620
postcode I can technically identify

197
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,570
somebody all right so this is where you

198
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,230
need to be careful on what how you

199
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:20,409
evaluate that personal data so if you

200
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,240
look at most data loss prevention

201
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,480
solutions or most technical solutions

202
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,260
they basically see personal data is this

203
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,650
right

204
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:33,760
so very simple name date of birth gender

205
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,699
address salary combs contacts IP

206
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,799
addresses emails addresses

207
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,630
but if you break it down to how you can

208
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,199
identify somebody it's a lot more

209
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:47,030
complex right so this isn't valid not in

210
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,160
my opinion anyway this is personal data

211
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:53,069
okay it's a lot more complicated because

212
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,079
you have things that go beyond just the

213
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,270
individual you have things like his

214
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,600
work-related statuses yeah things like

215
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:03,300
how he's using his mobile devices when

216
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,330
where where is he going

217
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:10,109
you've got medical information you've

218
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:14,580
got online information you got smart

219
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,810
devices IOT CCTV address yeah to top up

220
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,560
the addresses when you have all the

221
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,290
financial information and then you have

222
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,729
driving you know nowadays we use more

223
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,160
and more license plate identification

224
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,050
right so if you go into some parking

225
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,069
lots they identify your your license

226
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,170
plate and they see how long you've been

227
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,910
there but if that data gets leaked out

228
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,089
that means I can reify some of your

229
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,130
behavior right then there's also other

230
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,250
stuff there's political opinion genetic

231
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:43,860
data the interesting thing with the GDP

232
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,230
are is that also defines certain date of

233
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,910
it you're not allowed really to store or

234
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,830
you must store under certain conditions

235
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,839
things like little political opinions

236
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,030
trade unions if necessary they call that

237
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,620
sensitive data so there's certain

238
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,209
aspects of personal data which are even

239
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,740
more complex in it which have an even

240
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:06,810
greater impact if you breach so I did

241
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:08,730
some work was about well yeah probably a

242
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,050
year and a half ago where we started to

243
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,090
try and break this down into actual

244
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,959
fields that we could contain and and

245
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:18,750
describe and detect and this isn't a

246
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,110
complete list we started I think we got

247
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:25,110
up to about a hundred and some plus 125

248
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,910
plus fields and we just stopped because

249
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,800
we've answered some problems right so

250
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,310
there's a very generic types of things

251
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,829
so like Country tags I P addresses IMEI

252
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,079
GPS coordinates social networks email

253
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,030
addresses or if ID tags those are pretty

254
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,889
much common for any country in Europe

255
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,738
all right

256
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:46,319
then you get to the more country

257
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:48,359
specific things right so depending on

258
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:50,819
the country you may you may not have an

259
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:53,699
ID right so in the UK there's no

260
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:56,488
national ID in France and Germany

261
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,019
there's a national ID so you have

262
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,169
different values for different countries

263
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:04,019
you also have localization right a name

264
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:06,029
right because we are not only just Roman

265
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,730
Roman alphabet anymore we have Roman

266
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:10,649
alphabet plus at Eastern Europe and yeah

267
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,119
using European half of it so from a

268
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,910
technical point of view you need to kind

269
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:17,660
of address that right so you need to

270
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,910
understand all these things and it gets

271
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,069
really complex then you get to the

272
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,368
yellow box which is the Sun sensitive

273
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:29,939
data right so that's kind of the things

274
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:32,100
were under GDP are you can store only if

275
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,579
you have authorizations from the DBA at

276
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,379
EPA

277
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:38,309
so they DP as a Data Protection

278
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:39,989
Authority so that's things like D the

279
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:41,449
clearly in France remember what the one

280
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:44,509
in Belgium is called or the one in

281
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:46,498
Luxembourg there's if you look at the

282
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:48,119
cash registers on the bar they've

283
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:51,559
actually got a sticker from the that's

284
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:59,749
this register has been audited by the

285
00:11:51,559 --> 00:12:02,399
your Luxembourg IC DPA basically here

286
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,019
these reasons this information is

287
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,879
consistent sensitive because it actually

288
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,759
describes very personal information of a

289
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:11,519
data subject right so things like your

290
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:14,040
ethnicity so are you you know are you

291
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,559
Muslim are you or your religion are you

292
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,879
Muslim Catholic or things like that if

293
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,910
you think about the history of Europe

294
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,429
all of these types of all of this

295
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:27,419
especially the top part has been used in

296
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:29,759
the past to target people and to do

297
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,139
racial cleansing and things like that so

298
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,350
they want to avoid being able to

299
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,850
actually identify types of people so

300
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,739
this is a whole bunch of background

301
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,879
political background into why they've

302
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:43,259
actually even done this right so let's

303
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,989
get to the crux of the thing what is a

304
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:48,799
data breach right and how do we actually

305
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:51,799
sponsor data breach with personal data

306
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,799
so

307
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:58,269
if I go back to my loop how do I prepare

308
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:59,979
so identify all of this data I kind of

309
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:01,479
don't want to identify it afterwards

310
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,999
right I don't want to identify it here

311
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:06,220
or there because it'll be too late if my

312
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:08,589
breached if it takes me like five days

313
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,119
to understand my breach I'm gonna be too

314
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,009
late

315
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:14,859
so what I really want to do is I want to

316
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:18,009
focus my attention on the preparation

317
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:22,059
phase and the identification phase right

318
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:24,339
so that I actually understand where my

319
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:30,789
personal data is and I'm able to

320
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:34,899
identify as I go along so this is a flow

321
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:40,889
chart based on some work that the Enna's

322
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:43,599
are published that goes about 2017

323
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,869
basically they've break so I mean this

324
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:48,579
is essentially boils down to the same

325
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,649
steps right so we have the preparation

326
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:53,439
phase we have the event detection phase

327
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:56,889
and we have the containment and recovery

328
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:58,569
and then we have the lessons learned but

329
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,139
what they've done is they've actually

330
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:02,978
looked at how do you go about

331
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,669
understanding personal data in your

332
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:07,679
breach and when do you actually need to

333
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:11,259
notify the DBA

334
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,509
so what they've done is when you get an

335
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:16,059
event your typical first step is isn't

336
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:17,949
the event a breach so you want at this

337
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,679
stage you want to be able to say okay

338
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:23,258
I've got a breach I'm like it doesn't

339
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,608
involve personal data you want to

340
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:28,659
understand the circumstances of that

341
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:30,729
breach was it exploitation was it around

342
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,829
somewhere things like that you want to

343
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:35,019
understand the severity how many types

344
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:36,579
of personal data feel to affected how

345
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:39,189
much personal data is affected how many

346
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,149
data subjects are affected and you need

347
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:45,488
to understand if there's an easier

348
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:47,619
response needed so if you detect but

349
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:48,369
it's a personal data breach then you

350
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:50,589
need to start thinking about

351
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:52,139
notifications if you don't you just go

352
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:56,709
down into your containment and recovery

353
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:59,409
so primarily notification is do you need

354
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,669
to notify the DBA sometimes you do

355
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:03,819
sometimes you don't you need to that's

356
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:05,790
something that I usually a handoff to

357
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,170
discussions with legal teams because

358
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,839
really depends on how you interpret the

359
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,650
GDP are an independent also depend on on

360
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,530
your local Data Protection Authority

361
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:19,199
does it adversely affect data subjects

362
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:21,720
so will they hurt a data subject will it

363
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,760
hurt your customers right so if you lose

364
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,740
credit card numbers yes that might hurt

365
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,420
your corporate that might financially

366
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,550
hurt your good customers so you probably

367
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,469
need to notify your customers that's

368
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,449
when you do with any notification to

369
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,600
theta subjects now you notice I put

370
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:39,270
preliminary there because you need to

371
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,550
notify but the actual contents of the

372
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,260
notification doesn't mess isn't

373
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,300
necessarily defined at this time because

374
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,990
you need time to actually understand the

375
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,280
total impact of the breach so once

376
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,800
you've get to that stage you go into

377
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,230
further assessment and if needed you

378
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,930
detail the and evidence what data is

379
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,270
being breached and that's at that time

380
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,709
that you do a detailed notification so

381
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,150
that you can actually send out more

382
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,610
details and what's been breached the

383
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:08,160
effects and things like that you go into

384
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,460
your containment and recovery and then

385
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,689
you need to do a data breach inventory

386
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,550
that's an additional step that we don't

387
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,500
have normally in the instant response

388
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,660
process you need to keep an inventory of

389
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,560
what personal data you're actually has

390
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,480
actually been breached

391
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,180
because although something might not

392
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,950
happen tomorrow after the breach in six

393
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,239
months there might be a recurrence of

394
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,220
that same breach so you need to know

395
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,960
what data was affected but she also

396
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,340
might need to report it at a so you

397
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,960
might need to go back and report what's

398
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,030
the activities that you've done to

399
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:42,390
actually protect the data following that

400
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:43,680
breach now this is the part that you

401
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,470
need to do in 72 hours

402
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,150
[Music]

403
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,730
okay so that preliminary notification is

404
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,980
what needs to get done in 72 hours and

405
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,080
you know my big question to everybody is

406
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,710
does your event detection lead you to

407
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,950
this when you escalate an event to an

408
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,150
incident can you get to that stage where

409
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:11,160
you're reporting things that's 7-under

410
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:12,720
72 hours so breach show of hands how

411
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,980
many people think that a breach is just

412
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,720
exfiltration

413
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,579
so if you have if you have a breach in

414
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,319
your organization do you say it's a

415
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:25,689
breach if you exfiltrate date exfiltrate

416
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:28,270
data good nobody here because if you

417
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,950
read the gdpr i've i've been in a number

418
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,110
of companies especially on the other

419
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,390
side of the of the Atlantic where breach

420
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,399
stops at exfiltration if you read the

421
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:40,630
GDP are properly it's not just

422
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,150
exfiltration you have destruction so if

423
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,090
you get a ransomware attack you're full

424
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,980
under the GDP are all right so if your

425
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,720
personal data is if you've got personal

426
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,250
data it's like if you go database what

427
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,470
gets encrypted by ransomware with

428
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,660
personal data is technically unlawful

429
00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:01,990
destruction of the data and you need to

430
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:03,730
report it alteration so this is somebody

431
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,900
modify the data outside the parameters

432
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,030
of which you're collecting them or

433
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,890
somebody changes your information so

434
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,100
like I've submitted my information to us

435
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,540
to a store to a service when a malicious

436
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,760
admin goes in and changes my date of

437
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:20,620
birth right that falls under the GPR

438
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,910
doesn't have any main consequences money

439
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,129
for Sergeant there's one more before you

440
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,710
take the picture unauthorized disclosure

441
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,990
so that's here if somebody recent

442
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,130
personal data to the press or to a dark

443
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,490
web site or things like that

444
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:39,730
and finally unauthorized access this is

445
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:40,990
the killer one okay if you have let's

446
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,700
say technically you have a data breach

447
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,550
or I'll breach right some reason your

448
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,740
systems somebody's got a persistent

449
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,720
threat in your systems they're standing

450
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,400
there they're listening they hooked into

451
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,280
your applications knocked into the

452
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,300
databases if they do select star from

453
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,450
customer DB that's a breach on the GD P

454
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,450
are

455
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:08,210
okay it's unauthorized access how many

456
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,320
come I mean seriously in in this room do

457
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:14,780
you think your companies are ready to do

458
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:18,139
that last one probably not probably not

459
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:20,870
and this is this is where I mean I I get

460
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,340
I get okay's from the top two steps when

461
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,989
I start to get to the bottom three it's

462
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,449
like people like do we really need to do

463
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:34,010
that yes like wake up that's in the

464
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,990
breach - description of the GPR it's

465
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:40,030
it's funny because it's like nobody

466
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:43,130
thinks about this um I recently did a

467
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,960
pen test for somebody to the penthouse

468
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,450
for me and I was reading the results and

469
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,590
I was like huh I wonder if this

470
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,700
companies actually thought about this

471
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,530
part under the GDP are so if you're

472
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,240
doing pen tests red teaming you're okay

473
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,059
because there's right beside all 47 you

474
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,640
guys all know about Rosario 47 right now

475
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:04,220
recital 47 basically says but you're

476
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,590
allowed to test your protections if your

477
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,790
protections on of personal data so as

478
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,340
security teams you're allowed to

479
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,530
implement tools and test the protections

480
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,050
that you're implementing so it gives you

481
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,178
it gives si certs inserts the ability to

482
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,620
actually say okay we're doing this for

483
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:23,300
testing purposes to ensure that that

484
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:27,320
personal data is protected so the

485
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,990
preparation phase this is where I get

486
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,059
lots of question well not questions but

487
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,059
after we really need to do that and I'm

488
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:36,230
like how else are you going to actually

489
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:39,050
determine if you've got a personal data

490
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,210
breach if you don't understand where

491
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,490
your personal data lives and and is it

492
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,110
and is you're not going to be able to

493
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,679
actually focus your instant response

494
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,510
plan on that personal data so I like to

495
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,340
introduce this model right and so you

496
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,410
know I mean adapter sign identify you

497
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,730
think it's a very common model when

498
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,960
you're doing threat modeling right or

499
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,420
you when you're doing some kind of net

500
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,640
evolvability models as well so you want

501
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,900
to adapt your existing models so if you

502
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,550
have threat models and you're looking at

503
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,720
you know your fret models look at the

504
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,889
potential vulnerabilities and your

505
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,150
infrastructure and the threats against

506
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,190
your infrastructure your systems your

507
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,929
applications you want to look at those

508
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,669
and say well it's my personal data fit

509
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:15,110
into this

510
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:18,380
you want to assign personal data related

511
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:20,379
attributes as well so is this critical

512
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,900
date personal data will affect the user

513
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,789
will it be disastrous if I lose this

514
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,159
data will it is it sensitive data will

515
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:29,779
that have more impact you want identify

516
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,630
the risks right so I mean that's a

517
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:34,760
typical threat modeling aspect use the

518
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:40,900
DPI a and so you guys know what the DPI

519
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:43,400
is so inside the GDP are there's a

520
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,799
section where they talk about doing data

521
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,840
protection impact assessments

522
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,440
basically it's evaluating the risks

523
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,470
along on your personal data so you look

524
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,659
at you you document that and you can

525
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,640
build your accountability based on this

526
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:01,370
assessment GDP ours a lot about

527
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,960
accountability to be honest so then you

528
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,330
got to think we'll this harm the data

529
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,460
subject if I do is my credit card

530
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:11,570
database with a home data subject

531
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,340
probably yes financial loss right so you

532
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,980
want to think about if this personal

533
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:20,389
data gets leaked what's the impact on

534
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,649
that user or those users and once you

535
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,690
understand this you can put your

536
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:24,860
controls in place right because you're

537
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,590
going to need controls in place to

538
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:30,620
actually help you into the response so

539
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,000
this is a P ia okay this one's actually

540
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,379
from the keel so really nice one if you

541
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,580
go to the clear they even have a tool to

542
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,919
help you do them I'm gonna skip this

543
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,899
because this isn't really this is more

544
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:43,399
upstream from the incident response this

545
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:46,340
when you're modeling your personal data

546
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:51,649
fretts is really great so this is a

547
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,980
Noah's project crap forgot his names the

548
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,809
Guyver

549
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,899
this is the guy over on some photo photo

550
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:59,360
photo box in the UK he started this

551
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:00,879
basically he's done data flow mapping

552
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,620
he's built the data flow mapping process

553
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,260
so essentially what you do is you look

554
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,939
at your data source right so where's the

555
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,090
data coming from are you the controller

556
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,740
so if your controller what kinds of data

557
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,799
subject information are you are you

558
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,929
capturing or who's who it is what

559
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:21,230
information you're capturing while

560
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:24,200
you're processing it where you're why

561
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,429
the lawful basis of processing where

562
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,150
you're actually storing it and what

563
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:29,060
security

564
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,190
on to it the categories of recipients

565
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,220
where you might send the data to how

566
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,420
long you're retaining the data for and

567
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,740
some of the data transfers outside of

568
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:41,750
the EU on the US so basically if you so

569
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,810
for an example what you would do is you

570
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:47,960
say okay I'm a controller I'm looking at

571
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:50,360
my individuals I'm collecting tax

572
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,610
details pay details pension details bank

573
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,399
details contact details because it's an

574
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:59,330
HR database purpose of processing

575
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:02,420
personnel file right or payroll then

576
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:06,080
lawfully lawful SS contract I'm going to

577
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,840
retain it for one year post relationship

578
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,860
with you know one mayor post contract

579
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,439
I've got I'm gonna put all of these

580
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,360
security things in play I'm not going to

581
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,400
transfer it to any of us of a country oh

582
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,889
wait hold on sir my payrolls out sourced

583
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,740
oh wait I'm not I'm sending it to

584
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:24,430
another country categories of recipients

585
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:28,210
so HTML Caesars tax authority in the UK

586
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:31,010
might have a payment provider the banks

587
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,450
so you understand that the purpose of

588
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,760
this and the insert response process to

589
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,110
me is you understand number one what

590
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,930
personal data you're actually gathering

591
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,760
how it's being used so you can start to

592
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:44,270
look at where is it gonna actually sit

593
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,580
and where it's being sent so where my

594
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,740
transfer points so we're potentially my

595
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,439
areas where the data might be sitting in

596
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,850
an in a week zone right or might be

597
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,860
sitting in an area where somebody else

598
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:59,179
might actually capture it because if

599
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:01,129
you're the controller and say the bank

600
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,630
has an incident it's still your

601
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:07,220
responsibility to report it to the

602
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:09,260
employee right so you need to understand

603
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,300
that then it has to be added to your

604
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,030
incident response

605
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,909
so one of the ways but I talked to

606
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,649
company so this is funny

607
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,600
how many of you have done data discovery

608
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,890
I have done a date of discovery process

609
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:27,709
and actually know where your personal

610
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:30,140
data sits not too many most companies

611
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,460
can't fathom this I've done a couple for

612
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,850
a companies and they were like after the

613
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:37,280
first million records I say stop it's

614
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,959
like you can't it's this personal data

615
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,170
just becomes an explosion in a lot of

616
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,590
companies it just ends up everywhere so

617
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,760
they're different different governments

618
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,470
fingerprinting is the easiest in the

619
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,660
fastest but you need to know what kind

620
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,980
of personal data you have right so it's

621
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,140
not always good because you have to have

622
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,970
a pre-existing copy of other person that

623
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,510
area so you can fingerprint it and then

624
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,950
go look for it pattern matching is a

625
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,240
little bit better because you're

626
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,010
actually building patterns so like an

627
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,450
address can be built into a pattern so

628
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,440
you can actually find find a little bit

629
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,020
faster and you don't have to have a

630
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,520
fingerprint but ultimately and

631
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,090
especially if you start looking at

632
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,180
controls and detection reg X is the

633
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:19,760
answer right it's not good it's not it's

634
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,780
does a lot of false positives but until

635
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,590
we come up with something better and

636
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:29,780
pattern matching like NLP reg X is your

637
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:32,120
friend or your enemy depending so

638
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,250
basically a lot of times what I talk to

639
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,540
do tend to do when to understand where

640
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,190
the data is when I'm building my

641
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,440
Incident Response identification process

642
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,240
is I'll talk to the data owners so I'll

643
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,400
go to HR and say where do you put the

644
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,590
data how do you use it I call it the

645
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,930
environment now you can go high-priority

646
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,000
tools you can use Perl Python I'd prefer

647
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:52,250
a Perl because I'm old and you build a

648
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,810
data map and then you can focus your

649
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,640
detection and this is the important part

650
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,530
you want to focus your it detection and

651
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:02,090
then you want to do reg X right I mean

652
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:04,760
this we so if the here are some examples

653
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:07,760
of reg exes but I've used so like Greek

654
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,490
I banned Greek dat Greek national ID UK

655
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,960
passport you k-va-t UK national

656
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,330
insurance national resource just like a

657
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,710
social security credit card number this

658
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,100
one this nice little one is a bank

659
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,900
account number there's some Wikipedia

660
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,699
entries here the government guides

661
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,429
you're usually fine I'm actually trying

662
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,519
to build a GDP our data

663
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:31,340
pattern detection github but I keep

664
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,539
running into customers and I don't have

665
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,209
time to complete it

666
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:36,889
I only have so many hours in the day and

667
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:42,549
so many hours a day get you don't quit

668
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:46,340
quickly but how the f do you reg ex this

669
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:47,600
this is personal data okay if you work

670
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,580
for a bank you have a core or anything

671
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,289
but has a call center and you're

672
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,710
recording the calls for quality purposes

673
00:27:51,289 --> 00:28:02,179
or for auditing purposes that's personal

674
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:05,149
data CCTV is your CCTV completely

675
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:08,509
compartmentalize than your network how

676
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:10,959
long do you keep the tapes for all of

677
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:13,039
this stuff is personal data as well I

678
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,340
was with one company it's like we have

679
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:20,059
like 15 years worth of printed versions

680
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,009
of the of our documents you have a GDP

681
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,840
our process for that right it's like no

682
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:27,159
I thought it was only to F it was only

683
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:31,879
IT I know and she TPR any personal later

684
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:33,230
right so that this so the extension of

685
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:35,928
that is your assistance for response

686
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,730
plan becomes really complicated because

687
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:40,940
if you're not monitoring every potential

688
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:43,519
outflow of personal data you how are you

689
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,590
gonna do the 72 hours identification

690
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,029
this is the hard part

691
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,158
wait no data discovery was the hot part

692
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:50,740
no this is the hard part as well do you

693
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,759
have the right tools and the right

694
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:57,559
alerts in place to actually identify

695
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:59,299
when an event has personal data so

696
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,539
there's two ways to basically look at it

697
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:04,220
you do active detection so you have some

698
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:06,259
kind of M for network detection system

699
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,779
or you do passive you rely on data

700
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:11,840
discovery and look at your events I'll

701
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:15,529
dig into that so this is a process that

702
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,629
I try to push to to people and to get

703
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:19,850
people to look at so basically what I do

704
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:21,289
is I run the data discovery or I try to

705
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,740
understand all the personal data is I

706
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:26,629
dump that into a CSV I extract key

707
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,370
personal data locations I extract

708
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:31,939
network path servers locations I please

709
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:33,709
I built some look-up tables the extracts

710
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,330
what I do here I can update into if you

711
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,500
have DLP solutions in play we put them

712
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,750
into playing with what rules

713
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,960
play that actually focus on that on data

714
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,520
protect on personal data that gives you

715
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,460
a networking endpoint detection in real

716
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,570
well almost real time let's say look up

717
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:52,670
tables I feel then I push into your sim

718
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,000
or your log management platform to

719
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:56,930
actually extract reports and alerts

720
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,090
focused around the events what might

721
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,370
have personal data then you can build

722
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,830
alerts personal data dashboards personal

723
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,300
data reports you extract those reports

724
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,699
for your personal data breach and your

725
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,830
forensics in your notifications so

726
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,030
that's a quick overview of that but I

727
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,040
mean if you think about it's very simple

728
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,360
right it's not too complicated the

729
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,909
complicated part is getting all that

730
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,250
initial data understanding where that

731
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:23,420
personal data lives and building it into

732
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:25,760
that simp lat form so these are some of

733
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:29,180
the tools that I look at typically so

734
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,340
for data discovery you've got some you

735
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,960
know you got 3d dog that hasn't been

736
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,800
updated in a while but that one's open

737
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,020
source you've got the typical players

738
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,330
same thing for detection I've been

739
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:45,020
playing with using sis model and WMI for

740
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,879
detection it's complicated it doesn't

741
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,420
really work too well but I think it

742
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,790
could work if we had a little bit more

743
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,750
detection events on in system or if

744
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,710
you're looking at the cloud you're

745
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,770
probably looking to start looking at

746
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,930
Cosby and some next-gen products like

747
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,220
dark Trace although I don't still don't

748
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,310
believe that thing actually does

749
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:07,430
anything right correct you feed that

750
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,800
into your platform you're gonna pull out

751
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:11,120
reports and you're gonna send out alerts

752
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,760
and this is going to be a start of your

753
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,370
detection right that's going to help you

754
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,090
do your focalize your detection I don't

755
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:21,590
have all the answers unfortunately but

756
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,879
that's one of the reasons why I did this

757
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,949
talk because I want your feedback and

758
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,900
we'll get to that in sec you feed your

759
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,490
sim with your endpoint detection tools

760
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,870
your network events you capture your

761
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,100
file events that's very important you

762
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,389
need to capture the file events because

763
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,399
that's how you're going to detect if

764
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,980
there's unauthorized or alteration or if

765
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,200
there's enough for eyes access and you

766
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,940
want to do CVS lookups where external

767
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,240
lookups and your in things like Splunk

768
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,100
give me a complaint email bit lately so

769
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,080
you can do things like this you know

770
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,519
look up personal data paths CSVs

771
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,689
on the source file path and destination

772
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:58,019
file path this is more complex this is a

773
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,759
spunk oops this one's a splint query

774
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:02,610
we're basically looking for any personal

775
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,200
files that are being copied onto cloud

776
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:11,428
drives or something or some kind of

777
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:15,299
solution like that you run into really

778
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:18,059
is if you don't have kind of like if you

779
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:20,190
can't build this file those personal

780
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:21,809
data pass these you can't get these

781
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,239
queries out all right it's very

782
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:25,649
difficult to get the screws up and so

783
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:31,950
we're back to the problem of data

784
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:34,320
discovery this is another one so here

785
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:37,499
this is this was an attempt that we

786
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,539
tried to do generate a low false

787
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:41,820
positive but basically we were looking

788
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:43,350
at personal data path and the user right

789
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,619
so we associated users of personal data

790
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:50,309
pass so that we could actually detect if

791
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:52,168
a user was allowed to use that file so

792
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:54,019
remember the unauthorized access that's

793
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:57,679
how we were trying to contain that one

794
00:32:54,019 --> 00:33:00,450
so essentially we built a set of of

795
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,129
files list of file names and things like

796
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,470
that and all databases or network

797
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:06,330
servers associated to a list of users

798
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,649
this you can do this with products like

799
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:11,039
sale point things like that if you have

800
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:13,049
an access access request the management

801
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,450
system you can pull out the users were

802
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:20,789
authorized to address certain service or

803
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:22,559
certain paths files if that file is open

804
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:24,269
if there's a file operation on that one

805
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,519
of those file paths and you're not in

806
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:28,789
the looked in the allowed users then you

807
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:33,659
can go back and say okay this is a

808
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:36,059
unauthorized access notification I think

809
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:41,359
in a skip how good quickly for this one

810
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:44,100
because usually I pass this off to a

811
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,199
better understanding of your deep you

812
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,949
know this has to work with your DPO and

813
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,659
your and your PR and your legal teams

814
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,759
but essentially what you need to know

815
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,779
when you're doing building those reports

816
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,509
when you're building the information

817
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:58,879
which you need to capture is a

818
00:33:56,509 --> 00:34:00,829
the types of individual categories of

819
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:02,988
individuals were a concern some number

820
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:05,139
and deep or people data subjects what

821
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:11,539
personal data has been accessed or

822
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:13,518
reached let's get this one it's a bit

823
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:18,829
complex it's what's not complex but it's

824
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:20,899
just not partner so I know you know we

825
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:22,579
want to have this interchange with

826
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:26,000
people here so I've actually come up

827
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:28,669
with six subjects where I have questions

828
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,079
to you guys right so I'm going to kind

829
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:32,960
of feed this back to you guys

830
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,149
so if we talk about why in which so I'm

831
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,220
actually curious how many of you well

832
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:40,038
how many of you which I our process to

833
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:43,038
you guys actually use those you know she

834
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:48,250
is more focused on NIST or set or the

835
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:53,029
sounds one show of hands for NIST one

836
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:54,918
sounds yeah one the sounds I mean NIST

837
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:56,839
is very Americanized of I mean and

838
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,980
sounds has got more pushing in the in

839
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:59,960
Europe so I can understand that

840
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,339
so what about this how many of you have

841
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,329
actually we looked at your instant

842
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:12,319
response process since GDP are one two

843
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:20,839
three four five six so like 10% it's not

844
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:23,480
too bad had worse I mean it's a lot of

845
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,819
people just haven't the problem the

846
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,269
problem I found with that one is that

847
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:32,630
people have actually gone off on you and

848
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:34,069
said oh this is a compliance problem and

849
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,299
once they start talking about compliance

850
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:36,589
they start talking about all that you

851
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,029
know checks and balances and things like

852
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:40,369
that and they actually think about the

853
00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:41,990
impact on IT security teams and things

854
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:44,569
like that and they don't follow through

855
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:49,220
on the actual technical aspects of what

856
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:51,500
we're going what we need to do so when

857
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,980
so how many of you think you can respond

858
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,980
in 72 hours

859
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,529
does anybody have any opinion on this or

860
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:03,019
any opinions and well actually I'd like

861
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:04,599
to get your feedback on when you think

862
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:06,919
personal data detection should happen

863
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,010
I've presented to you mine which is

864
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,869
during identification and

865
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:18,780
and detection does anybody have any

866
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:21,300
other ideas nobody

867
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:26,369
you just haven't thought about it right

868
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,369
hasn't come across your path it's hard

869
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:32,859
okay so yeah maybe something that we

870
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:36,910
could try to implement in order to reach

871
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:40,720
different forces to implement like flag

872
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:43,450
you know inventory system to say not

873
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,500
what the system contains but just does

874
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:51,368
it contain data that is belonging to the

875
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:53,290
GDP regulation or not so that we know if

876
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:55,030
the system is impacted at the beginning

877
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:57,160
of the incident we can directly send

878
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:00,850
this notification even though we do not

879
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,830
have the full extent of detail of the

880
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,600
data breach we know that one of the SEM

881
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,270
has been impacted and the flag is true

882
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,670
so yeah and it'll help you start that

883
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,710
investigation right and I've seen quite

884
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:14,440
a few companies actually take that that

885
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:18,340
idea and approach as long as you've got

886
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,960
some kind of as as you said a flag where

887
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,700
you can start your approach or you can

888
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,230
start your think four process on does

889
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,149
this contain personal data needs to be

890
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:27,760
notified

891
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,780
that's it doesn't at the end of the day

892
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,820
it doesn't really matter where it

893
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,260
happens it's just you got to take into

894
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,400
account how long is it going to take you

895
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:39,520
to respond to that flag right so because

896
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,760
that flag becomes your kind of when I

897
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,070
became aware of the incident right so

898
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,920
that from that time frame you need 72

899
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,720
hours so what happens if somebody else

900
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,980
tells me I've got personal data on the

901
00:37:49,720 --> 00:38:00,700
internet from my company do you guys if

902
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:02,410
you guys thought about that one no well

903
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,640
I mean it's just somebody else told me I

904
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:09,190
started from that I didn't detect it now

905
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,629
that opens a whole nother bag of that's

906
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,630
not really related to in some response

907
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,690
what and where so

908
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,690
I showed you the personal data

909
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:24,750
definition how many of you have a very

910
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:27,870
large personal data data definition or

911
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,820
our youth well I mean what's your what

912
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:36,480
how do you categorize personal data in

913
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:41,970
your organization anybody I should have

914
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,350
done this it's not direct answer but

915
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,180
it's something my mentor to me in my

916
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,009
company you see that most of the time

917
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:50,160
people they say okay I need for example

918
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,420
a motorized vehicle so you as an

919
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,589
engineer you ask would you want to carve

920
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,390
about the motorcycle I say I want to

921
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:59,580
motorcycle race vehicle and then

922
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:02,100
something bad happen it can come back to

923
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:05,310
you and say see I wanted a boat it said

924
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,049
what I wanted so I just want to keep the

925
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,020
term as broad as possible so we can

926
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:13,440
include what they want what we want

927
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:14,880
after these events I don't think I think

928
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,220
you it's a certain extent you're right

929
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,160
because if you look at the definition on

930
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:22,290
the under the gdpr for example they say

931
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,480
anything that can be used to identify in

932
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:27,420
a day an individual it directly or

933
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,520
indirectly so the colors I wear one day

934
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,260
could technically be used if they're

935
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,210
very unique could technically be used to

936
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:37,830
reify me all right but one of the great

937
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,700
conversations I have with companies is

938
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:43,950
when does it become identifiable a

939
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:46,200
birthdate by itself isn't identifiable

940
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:51,750
right because many people born on the

941
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,609
same day so I get so I mean here's a

942
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:56,220
story along that line I was in I was

943
00:39:53,610 --> 00:40:00,060
checking out of a hotel in Monaco last

944
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:03,950
year after there's a season and I asked

945
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:07,890
for my bill and the guy goes okay so

946
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:12,870
yeah Thomas Thomas Fisher you live in X

947
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:16,020
Y is there Germany it's like nope damn

948
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:20,180
things and it's like you sure it's not

949
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:23,580
you they date of birth like mm-hmm

950
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:25,589
we went through for names like that and

951
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,420
I just told the guys stop it's like

952
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,180
doesn't your manager to teach you about

953
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,819
personal day elite

954
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:33,618
and the guys like no it's like you just

955
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:36,499
basically give them the information of

956
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:43,430
four people and it's technically a

957
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:48,049
violation of so many laws so the the

958
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:50,680
thing was my name alone wasn't able to

959
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:53,180
me I dent off' i me in directly right

960
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,058
but indirectly he could he went through

961
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:00,109
five different names but allowed him to

962
00:40:56,059 --> 00:41:01,700
identify who I really was and that's the

963
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:02,769
problem of this directly or indirectly

964
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,180
in the gdpr

965
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:08,089
is like a piece of information by itself

966
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,430
may not identify a person but if you get

967
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:12,558
multiple data breaches and data and and

968
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,609
multiple pieces of data sitting in

969
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,460
different applications in different

970
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:19,960
databases suddenly get taken by the same

971
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,859
person or get aggregated somewhere else

972
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,160
how far they're going to be able to

973
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:26,749
actually re identify that person and

974
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,339
this is the this is kind of questions

975
00:41:26,749 --> 00:41:30,980
that I still am I mean I haven't been

976
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:32,869
able to solve iver right because at one

977
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,789
time did they steal the names database

978
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:37,670
that then got the credit card database

979
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:42,799
and how does that credit card database

980
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:44,239
relate back to the name database I mean

981
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:45,739
I don't I don't really have an answer to

982
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,319
that unless everything is flat file

983
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:50,029
right but when you can extract it via

984
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,920
the application but as individual pieces

985
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:54,700
of information how long will it take

986
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:59,180
that person to reify my credit card

987
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:03,919
right so you have to think in those kind

988
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:08,558
of it's a into a vicious game let's get

989
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:11,420
that one so this one is also fun to is

990
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:15,549
how many of you who are doing instant

991
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,549
response know the name of your DP oh

992
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:20,059
okay

993
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:22,399
that's good not enough hands but that's

994
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:28,029
good how many of you interact with PR

995
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,029
and comms people even less

996
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:41,340
do you as an ensign responder

997
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:44,660
communicate with TPA no no it's a DPF

998
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:50,190
communicates OTP that's the role of dpo

999
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:58,290
as defined in the legislation who do you

1000
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:59,040
inform in the dps yeah okay so let me

1001
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,790
rephrase the question

1002
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,020
who does which DPA does a GPO inform

1003
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,580
because the DPO might come back to you

1004
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:10,800
and say okay so I can weather this data

1005
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:15,150
breach occur if you're a multinational

1006
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:18,410
organization and it's a server in France

1007
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:20,670
with French personal data information

1008
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:23,970
you probably your first port of call is

1009
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:26,520
the key right but if that database also

1010
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:31,348
contains German information do I go also

1011
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:34,230
go and talk to the German DPA so this is

1012
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:37,560
where depending on your legal team

1013
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:40,859
you'll get an answer of yes but if you

1014
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,080
actually read the legislation they're

1015
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:44,940
supposed to coordinate DPA is a supposed

1016
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,348
to coordinate across Europe so

1017
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,990
technically if our reports from the

1018
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:50,760
Camille I can just notify that the

1019
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,839
German DPA but I've reported that the

1020
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,589
clear but there's probably German

1021
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,270
information inside that breach right

1022
00:43:54,589 --> 00:44:00,299
it's not my problem anymore so final

1023
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:03,330
thoughts 28 percent of organizations are

1024
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:06,180
not ready for the gdpr that was last

1025
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:09,990
year just recently I read a report one

1026
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:13,649
in six business this is our unprepared

1027
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:21,270
for a data breach and this was my

1028
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:22,589
favorite was just recently right that's

1029
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,359
the British Airways one if you can't see

1030
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:28,940
it

1031
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:31,980
38 380,000 payment cards were captured

1032
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,440
over two month period I'm still waiting

1033
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,359
for the file on that one and I ate the

1034
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,160
worst part is I literally booked a

1035
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:40,580
ticket a day and a half before this was

1036
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,580
announced

1037
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,350
so I was really happy it's been spent

1038
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,030
the whole morning on my credit card

1039
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,610
