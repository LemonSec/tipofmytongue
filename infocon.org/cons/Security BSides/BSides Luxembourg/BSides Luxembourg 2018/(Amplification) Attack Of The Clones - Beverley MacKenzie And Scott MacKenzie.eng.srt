1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:09,350
hi I am Pepe McKenzie is giving you my

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:15,200
bio I'm presently doing my PhD in IOT

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:21,230
and blockchain security hey Scott hi I'm

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:23,988
Mackenzie working the industry for fair

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:28,610
bit over 20 odd years across lots of

6
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:30,800
areas lots of areas of unix security

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,480
infrastructure architecture pretty much

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,680
just a general there technophile many so

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,319
yeah today we're going to talk to you

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,700
about and others about Delilah service

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:47,930
about district another service how its

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,850
evolved the techniques and the various

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:56,510
mitigations we'll look at some of the

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:59,030
case studies probably just look at for

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,370
Louis which is shows a number of very

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,519
very interesting mitigations that can be

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:09,560
applied and and then we'll move on to a

18
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,830
question answer towards the end so and

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,720
to start off with looking at the

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:18,140
protocol distinct ocean most denial of

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,270
service attacks can be grouped into m2

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,720
you've got your network based layer

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,798
three and four and star the tax and then

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,900
you've got the slightly more difficult

25
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,760
to deal with them less they have an

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,830
application level attacks so just to run

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,990
through the concepts because these are

28
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,110
fundamentals to what a lot of the other

29
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,600
attacks are based on reflection

30
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,530
essentially the attacker would then

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,990
would choose the IP address of the

32
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,630
victim they would spoof that IP address

33
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:54,320
and they would fire a request with that

34
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,240
spoofed IP address at a number of

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,970
different resolver services which would

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,298
be able to then reflect the data back to

37
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:05,000
the victim amplification as the name

38
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,040
sounds the concept behind it is you send

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,139
a small number of packets into one of

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,079
many services and they respond with a

41
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,239
much larger response and obviously these

42
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:17,120
concepts can be scaled up

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,700
I find this very nice table that shows

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,240
some of the amplification factors of the

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,790
different UDP protocols here so as you

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,660
can see commonly used are the DNS and

47
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,269
NTP and attacks things like have found a

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,299
Model S to NTP which talks back a fair

49
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:39,830
bit of data interestingly memcache gives

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:44,060
an almost 50,000 increase in response so

51
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,920
it's quite desirable your flood attacks

52
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,920
essentially are basically just chucking

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,940
large amounts of data and to target and

54
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,940
normally launched from their botnets so

55
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,970
what is the DOS attack

56
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,160
well if dos came for DDoS and that's

57
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,950
where it all started

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,430
thank you so the DOS attack is quite

59
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,790
brilliant

60
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,410
um what it does is it's booths usually

61
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,660
but there are some new techniques which

62
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,240
doesn't require spoofing but usually

63
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,070
spoofed and IP address and it gets an

64
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,640
amplification attack or reflection

65
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:25,850
attack where you get loads of reactions

66
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,190
from hosts either to a broadcast or

67
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:34,070
other mechanisms back at the spoof

68
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:35,660
address all right so let's go back to

69
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,320
the beginning the Smurf attack and

70
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,720
faculty tack that started in 1997 from a

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,359
guy called T freak which I assume is not

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,609
the name his mum gave him and he was the

73
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,610
first person to launch but DOS attack

74
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,140
and the first one was labeled a smurf

75
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,180
attack and it's quite cool because what

76
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,980
they did as you probably all know is

77
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,740
they use echo they use ICMP echo packets

78
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,989
they threw those at the broadcast and

79
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,750
they use a spoof IP and it was the

80
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,310
response from the others getting back to

81
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,680
the broadcast message that triggered the

82
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:17,600
first boss attack a variant on that was

83
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:19,910
UDP packets used in freckles I'm Paul

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,550
here right so the mitigations and

85
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:27,230
they're quite straightforward closed

86
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,230
down UDP port seven in your UNIX and

87
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,870
Linux

88
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,760
don't leave demons that you don't need

89
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,930
running close down all your demons in

90
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,789
your Windows environment closure

91
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,610
services you've also got don't allow

92
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,820
more cost in unless you need it

93
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:46,890
echo replaying echos I'm close those

94
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,520
down if you can but they are network

95
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:57,450
Diagnostics so and keep a few open

96
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:59,780
you've got you've also got a request for

97
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,950
comment

98
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,690
request for comment which is actually

99
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,450
tsipras stipulated that the one of the

100
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,469
easiest way to stop dos attacks is to

101
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,330
for ISPs to stop allowing a little

102
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,510
illegitimate packets leaving their

103
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,010
network and so if you've got an IP that

104
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,320
doesn't actually exist in your network

105
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,349
don't allow it onto the wider world

106
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,260
network another thing is if we all as

107
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,270
host in the network don't allow illegal

108
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,870
illegitimate package to float around

109
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,849
I forgot private network IP we drop it

110
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,420
we don't pass it on simple things like

111
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,500
that

112
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:40,500
can't stop dos attacks and if you think

113
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,230
dos attacks are over think again you

114
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,270
have companies such as the power tech in

115
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:50,040
net scan who are actually providing the

116
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:52,260
service to script kiddies and crackers

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,020
and the service they provide is if they

118
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,690
scan networks that are not implementing

119
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,960
the correct security and then they put

120
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:06,540
that information up so it's alive and

121
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:09,870
it's well and it's still growing so

122
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:13,610
jumping on to slowloris as a case study

123
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:16,710
now interestingly this is one of my

124
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:20,900
favorite DDoS methods if you can have a

125
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:23,430
favorite really it's it's named after a

126
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,460
rather cute little primate that moves

127
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,530
really really slowly and the advantages

128
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,450
at all this with very little input an

129
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:35,820
attacker can create quite an impressive

130
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:37,900
amount of air damage so his primary

131
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,099
effects thread based web servers

132
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,510
and the most common of those is Apache

133
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,960
so it's based around the concept of

134
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:50,409
standard 8 we get requests which we all

135
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,440
use on a daily basis now within the HTTP

136
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,900
1.1 protocol you're get where guests

137
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,190
will be for your header will be

138
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,099
terminated with a carriage return line

139
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,790
feed and then another carriage return

140
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,080
line feed and what's the lowest does is

141
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,090
sit there sends the first carriage

142
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,530
return line feed and then only a

143
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,190
carriage return and leaves a web server

144
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:15,099
waiting for that final line feed now am

145
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,890
i patch for you or set a lesson for

146
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,210
default of 300 seconds for the HTTP had

147
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,680
a request to have to complete and then

148
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,330
then it will reset that counter again

149
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,770
and since the client sends any

150
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:31,930
additional data so when basically if the

151
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,030
malicious user sends multiple requests

152
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,300
it'll quickly flood the system it also

153
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,820
evades most of your firewall ids/ips

154
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,160
systems because it's not a malformed

155
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,820
request which makes it an interesting

156
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,560
one to mitigate so looking at apache

157
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,090
first of all those forms of mitigation

158
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,310
there's a three common apache modules

159
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:58,210
the 10 i would recommend you can

160
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,460
mitigate with so firstly Modric timeout

161
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:05,020
that's really quite useful because that

162
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:07,599
allows you to set a a bytes per second

163
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,030
rate for delivering the HTTP headers and

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,490
a time to do it for the whole had a

165
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,169
delivery to complete and any failure and

166
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,570
to complete within that time span

167
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,150
whoever's up the surf fishing for a

168
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,920
write request timeout back to the client

169
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,159
it's also got similar configuration

170
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,470
options for the body message so it's

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,640
quite useful and across the board not

172
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,880
just for slaw lovers but it's a

173
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,880
mitigation for lots of other DDoS and

174
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:37,840
then slow attack methods second one

175
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:41,169
would be to use mod QoS this allows

176
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,149
prioritization of your HTTP requests

177
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,189
allows you to set limits on the number

178
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:48,130
of connections from a single source IP

179
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,860
which can be quite useful and it will

180
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,660
also monitor how your servers performing

181
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,829
and under above certain threshold it

182
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,480
will disable you HTTP keeper lives and

183
00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:00,880
also allows you to then set a and the

184
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,740
throughput rate as well and the final

185
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,649
recommendation for Apache modules would

186
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,959
be mod security now this is a complete

187
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:11,529
Web Application Firewall so this

188
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:13,810
mitigates them not just them and the

189
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,600
DDoS but also things like cross site

190
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,399
scripting Scott COSO reflection same

191
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,100
origin and very some things and just

192
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,010
keeping the focus here on slowest

193
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,430
mitigation what it does also is to

194
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,260
monitor how many air for eight hours

195
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,819
have been returned to a client and if

196
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,639
there's a certain number within a

197
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,139
particular period that you configure and

198
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,670
any future requests coming from that

199
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:40,060
client will just be stopped in their

200
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,880
tracks by sending a TCP fin packet so

201
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,420
additional mitigations for slowest which

202
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,910
again work for lots of other m dot and

203
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,120
DDoS type attacks depending on your

204
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:55,480
budget has to go HTTP load balancer in

205
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,149
front of it and for example an f5 big IP

206
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,910
I don't work fair five just successfully

207
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,649
used them a lot in the past and

208
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,750
basically that would sit there and

209
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,149
listen for a complete HTTP request

210
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:10,449
before that's forwarded on to the web

211
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:12,699
server you could also look to use a non

212
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:14,620
flooded web server like engines I know

213
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:16,899
there was a case where someone coded

214
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,300
Galeras is a similar slow attack for

215
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,949
engines but that's since been patched so

216
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,380
don't use the old versions friend jinx

217
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:26,920
and also if you're running on Linux then

218
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,980
iptables allows you to set connections

219
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,110
per second you can also exclude proxies

220
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,000
as well because obviously if lots of

221
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,310
people come from one proxy address that

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,269
could be blocked and that's not

223
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,859
something you don't want either so a few

224
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,779
other tools and if we've got time it

225
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,060
then we can go back to some of them that

226
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,980
there's a few tools out there and we can

227
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,410
run through some some of the methods of

228
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,519
how you can mitigate those

229
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:56,540
so looking at one of the largest DDoS

230
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,100
attacks it we had in recent history

231
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,649
there was a case of spam house versus

232
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,259
cyberbunker now cyberbunker got its name

233
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:07,800
because they operate out of an old Cold

234
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:09,449
War nuclear site and Dutch hosting

235
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,430
company and our policy is generally

236
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:12,599
anything goes as long as it's not child

237
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,649
porn or terrorism

238
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,329
now spam has her basically identified

239
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:21,029
that they were hosting a large number of

240
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:24,449
internet spammers and so they

241
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:26,610
blacklisted them the result was the

242
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:29,399
biggest at that time a DDoS attack

243
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:32,490
occurred against Spamhaus which peaked

244
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,800
at just over 300 gigabits per second now

245
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,680
they were able to mitigate this because

246
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,849
they utilized them CloudFlare CDN and

247
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,459
their anycast routing systems so the IP

248
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,740
address was presented for spam house by

249
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,959
CloudFlare and then that was distributed

250
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,990
across their 23 data centers worldwide

251
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,319
and so quite mercifully they were able

252
00:11:51,990 --> 00:12:00,089
to absorb the full impact to that 300

253
00:11:55,319 --> 00:12:01,589
bits DDoS so they are following on from

254
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:05,149
that because that used a techno

255
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:07,649
technique called M DNS amplification and

256
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:09,209
buying the later versions of find a

257
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:10,380
patch to introduce her feature called

258
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:13,109
them RRL

259
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:17,779
the response rate limits that allows you

260
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:24,000
to basically tweak your DNS servers to

261
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:25,819
avoid the the use of them for one of

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,810
these amplification attacks

263
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:33,029
so yeah this always crosses almighty

264
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,059
so basically CD ends are a really useful

265
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:38,130
tool to open the toolbox

266
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,870
depending on the company some montt may

267
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,019
want to set up themselves running

268
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,089
multiple systems worldwide or IDs one of

269
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,459
the free ones or purchase the commercial

270
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:50,639
service of them but yeah this basically

271
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,020
can act to mitigate a larger number of

272
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,930
DDoS attacks

273
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,600
so this is flashings another thing that

274
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,390
we don't see very often that is

275
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,110
potentially very very dangerous because

276
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,140
anywhere where you can do a network

277
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:07,260
firmware update on a device and if

278
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,360
that's a malformed firm firmware you can

279
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,520
essentially break the device now the

280
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,620
context is very important here because

281
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,189
if this is a smart meter across an

282
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:21,360
electric grid then then the consequences

283
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:23,790
could be extremely major black holdings

284
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,190
another mitigation technique that we

285
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,529
will come across is to mitigate

286
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,770
basically tweaking the BGP routes and

287
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:34,290
you can channel your traffic your Beados

288
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,839
traffic down to basically the Devon all

289
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,020
type location or off to a particular

290
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:47,610
location so traffic can be examined and

291
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:50,610
forensically interrogated so we come to

292
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:54,740
IOT dos they does attacks which are

293
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:57,300
quite new the first one occurred in 2016

294
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,810
but before we go over that there are two

295
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,479
types of IOT DDoS attacks you first have

296
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:06,750
attacks on IOT devices which we haven't

297
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,339
seen very much yet there's been a couple

298
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,520
of cases and we'll go over those and

299
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:15,500
then you have IOT devices being used to

300
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:18,689
attack other host knows within a network

301
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,660
now IOT devices if you don't know what

302
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,310
they are are small form computers that

303
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,469
are embedded in many things too many

304
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:29,189
things you've got them in your fridge

305
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:32,250
your router your insulin pump you've got

306
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,839
them in your kids toys and it's been

307
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:38,040
estimated that in the next two years

308
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:41,670
there will be 21 billion IOT devices in

309
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,380
our homes and our lives and one of the

310
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,709
problems are there several problems with

311
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,360
them but some of the major problems is

312
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:51,959
that they exist within their

313
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,470
heterogeneous network there are really

314
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,899
poor interoperability between different

315
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,800
companies they fundamentally suffer from

316
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:05,449
integrity confidentiality and

317
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,609
authorization issues and we saw the

318
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,910
IOT cases were kids

319
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:15,379
toys being used to have his information

320
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:19,740
including kids photographs voices

321
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:22,370
address and likes and dislikes via IOT

322
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:28,860
devices and we can see where that goes

323
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:31,949
we also saw one well two and three

324
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,939
letter organizations harvesting

325
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:38,069
information via a Weeping Angel an

326
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:42,050
attack using IOT devices so the early

327
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:48,420
runners were the early runners were

328
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:51,029
quite small but quite scary but then we

329
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:55,170
started to see changes and in 2016 we

330
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:58,230
saw the first change the Mirai bug.toss

331
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,569
attack the DDoS attack came along then

332
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,540
we had the paseo which hasn't actually

333
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:07,498
happened its harvesting and it's being

334
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:12,750
noted and it's scary and then we've got

335
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:16,250
the the Moose which is kind of funny sad

336
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:21,209
and a bit scary and I'll go into those

337
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:23,399
so let's start with Mirai this happened

338
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:26,430
June 2016 and this was the first time

339
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:30,120
people became aware everybody outside of

340
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:35,430
IOT became aware of its potential and

341
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:38,610
what it did was it took they recruited

342
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,469
any IOT devices in the network and what

343
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,120
the botmaster did was then got those

344
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:49,769
devices to send lookup queries to German

345
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,360
ISP and it flooded it flooded the

346
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,759
network to the point where you had a

347
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,300
network storm and traffic couldn't come

348
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,730
in or go out and it was kind of a good

349
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,729
goal for them insofar as that they

350
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,159
stopped they affected companies like

351
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,860
Netflix as well as taking down the

352
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:10,980
actual ISP so it was um a

353
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:13,619
proof-of-concept in many ways and it

354
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:17,880
proved what could be done then they

355
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,198
released the code out there on github so

356
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:25,169
anyone can get

357
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:28,950
I've got a coffee that seemed to be as

358
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:35,010
bad as it got until pronounces as you

359
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:37,799
like is Arabic and in 2017 a company

360
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:41,760
called trend noticed unusual activities

361
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:45,000
taking place in cameras IOT cameras and

362
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:49,200
they documented it logged it and watched

363
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,760
them and what was happening is I am

364
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,590
these cameras have a plug-and-play

365
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,330
mechanism which allows easy acces for us

366
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,809
or you just want to get them and do what

367
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:04,529
we want to do but the downside is is not

368
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:06,029
secure and this was actually brought to

369
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:07,769
the industry's attention and they

370
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:11,850
supposedly patched it but he still

371
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:15,059
exists in many devices and this was a is

372
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:19,969
being exploited at this moment by this

373
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:23,190
new D dos and these devices are

374
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,380
basically we're we're believing are

375
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:30,120
going to be used because of the way they

376
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:32,610
send their SSD packets out they don't

377
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,908
actually need to spoof an IP so these

378
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:38,428
devices will be up to 120 thousand

379
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:40,289
cameras on the network are protected to

380
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:42,809
be infected and we're still waiting to

381
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,908
see what their target is and what

382
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:48,840
they're intending to take down so this

383
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:51,320
is one to come some time and we believe

384
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,928
it's originating from the Middle East

385
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,908
due to some of these data and stuff

386
00:18:54,929 --> 00:19:00,570
views within that that could not be true

387
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:03,090
or it could be true and then we've got

388
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,279
the line it's moves not quite a DDoS a

389
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:09,240
bar is using and command and control

390
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:12,990
it's used in all the the fingerprints of

391
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,980
a DDoS attack and it's actually monitor

392
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,720
eyes dit for the ego market I like it

393
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,760
because it's funny and I don't use the

394
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,340
ego market and I'm amazed of what these

395
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,340
people will do but it's actually going

396
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,769
out there and taking over routers and

397
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,320
then hijacking packets which relate to

398
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:35,190
social networks

399
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,350
and then allowing people to do those

400
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,230
networks into allowing them to have more

401
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,870
views or whatever you do on those

402
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,900
networks so that's the indication of

403
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,639
where monetization of this technology is

404
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,500
actually going to go you've got two

405
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,910
players or two actors you've got the

406
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,230
monitor ization and you've got

407
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:56,850
government actors that seem to be

408
00:19:52,230 --> 00:20:02,760
dominating this market so mitigation is

409
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:08,639
the same old same old patch in 2015

410
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:11,030
you had Fiat had to do a mass recall 1.4

411
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,680
million of their cars had to be recalled

412
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:18,450
because dried by dust which is a DDoS

413
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,660
attacks were taking place the first type

414
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,730
where cars security was so flaky that

415
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,520
people could take over the steering

416
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,560
wheel engine management the engine of

417
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,350
the car while it was on the road and

418
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,960
they had to do a quick recall to patch

419
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:38,010
their systems up so patching is your

420
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,050
first line of defense you then got a

421
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,170
small growth but a growth nonetheless of

422
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:46,110
anti-malware taking place in IOT it's

423
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:50,520
been a network-based m2m networks

424
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:53,580
because of the interoperability Andy a

425
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,260
genius nature of IOT device is difficult

426
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,570
if not impossible at this stage to

427
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,150
design an anti-malware to go on devices

428
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:04,310
plus you've got hardware and memory size

429
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:06,240
problems change the password I mean

430
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,159
where that's possible it's very

431
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,080
difficult to change a password on your

432
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,490
network fridge because they generally

433
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,159
don't give you the ability but where you

434
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,830
can change the password closed ports

435
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,400
down if you've got a plug-and-play

436
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:24,350
device it don't allow devices on your

437
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,560
side of network to use the plug-and-play

438
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:30,540
dis activated don't allow it to happen

439
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,790
in the case of Mirai you can actually

440
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,790
flush that by just turning your device

441
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:38,790
off on on again because it's held in

442
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,720
memory within with respect to a purse it

443
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,810
foreseer I

444
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,160
that's not possible it actually will you

445
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,100
can turn it off and turn it on you will

446
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,660
still be can't

447
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,159
native more to the point you can

448
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,950
actually change your password and

449
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,020
because of a zero-day exploit which is

450
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,179
known of it will come back

451
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,950
it's literally I mean we're looking at

452
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:00,660
ways of trying to stop this but the

453
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:06,309
devices that are affected are affected

454
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:08,140
you can standardization I'm a strong

455
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,820
believer in standardization you've got

456
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,830
6lowpan which is IP version 6

457
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,549
application for small form I Oh T

458
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:20,199
devices combined with 802 14.5 and there

459
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:25,539
are security measures that are contained

460
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,460
within those that could also help but

461
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:29,169
the bottom line is a lot of companies

462
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,000
are going for their security by

463
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:33,549
obscurity and this curtain office said

464
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,650
this is no security at all so I'm a

465
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:37,150
strong believer that the industry has to

466
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,010
come together we have to come up with

467
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,190
standards we have to implement security

468
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:45,429
I remember Microsoft when they first

469
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,070
came on a long time ago and the security

470
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:50,200
was flaky then they're now really secure

471
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,030
they've come in line and if we as an

472
00:22:50,200 --> 00:23:01,240
industry can actually get standards in

473
00:22:52,030 --> 00:23:03,190
place we can up our game so just looking

474
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,510
at some of the things that happened this

475
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:10,230
year we've had teams from your Europol a

476
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:14,470
combination of the Dutch police and the

477
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,970
UK's NCAA and they shut down their web

478
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,690
stresser which was one of the largest

479
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:23,350
stressor sites responsible for basically

480
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,030
selling DDoS as a service and their web

481
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:30,789
stuff so allowed you to run out his

482
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:33,100
service and for various fees his admin

483
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:35,890
was spread out in various locations and

484
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:40,270
around the world and in different places

485
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:41,799
I've been taken to custody that they

486
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,168
could be it they were basically charging

487
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:49,179
fees that were as low as 15 euros a

488
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:52,350
month for a DDoS capability so basically

489
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:54,850
looking at meters and stresses in this

490
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,389
stressing service husband spun up over

491
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,540
the last few years

492
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:02,510
the services are being sold to

493
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,480
subscribers and some of them are happy

494
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,190
to call themselves boaters some of them

495
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,020
think it's better to call themselves and

496
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,049
stress us because they're testing the

497
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:15,559
limits of your network you're on flaky

498
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:17,270
legal ground either way so very quickly

499
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:22,210
just having a look at the motivations

500
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:25,070
and there's probably five different ones

501
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,170
finance always comes into play you've

502
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,350
got the revenge case which is normally

503
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:32,330
amongst em kids and them arguing over

504
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,730
online games in a lot of cases or

505
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,860
pranking them in some cases there's I

506
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,710
thought your core belief or hacktivism

507
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,620
that there is some motivation that's

508
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,540
spun up a lot with a lot of us and the

509
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,149
lower than the high orbit to iron

510
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:50,629
cannons for some people's intellectual

511
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,669
challenge and there's nation-states but

512
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,390
looking at it as a potential for cyber

513
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:57,919
warfare so it's an example of some of

514
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:03,890
the adverts that we've seen out there

515
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:06,260
for them feed us as a service so yeah

516
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:10,540
some of our takeaways here patch

517
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:13,820
everything up to save all your UPnP and

518
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:17,090
love to put buy balances in and maybe CD

519
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,490
ends things like that disable DNS and

520
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,830
NTP access queries to everyone out there

521
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,440
on the Internet

522
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,418
otherwise you're complicit and there are

523
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,410
RC guidelines out there is how you can

524
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:33,710
do a lump of the mitigations interesting

525
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,990
one and somewhat controversial because

526
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,490
people do use tor for legitimate reasons

527
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,220
because depending where they are in the

528
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,080
world if your reason if your users of

529
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,390
your site in your application have no

530
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,100
good reason to be connecting from tor

531
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,290
for example they're doing internet

532
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,850
banking why you would want to do that

533
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,530
and going through tor in the first place

534
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,110
I'm not sure giving the bank already has

535
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,270
all your details then just block all the

536
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,678
Tor endpoints you can download lists to

537
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,480
find out where they are because an awful

538
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,140
lot of the attacks will come through the

539
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,630
Tor endpoints

540
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:08,350
so sleeping here open up to some

541
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:11,890
questions I don't agree with a toaster

542
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:14,559
here I think there are lots of reasons

543
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,020
to use tor and I mean blocking people

544
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,360
who aren't part of this world our

545
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,158
Western world and stopping them having

546
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,500
access by blocking tour there are other

547
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,000
ways of actually stopping dos attacks

548
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,890
DDoS attacks which don't involve

549
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,780
actually excluding people who aren't in

550
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,240
our world but anyway we're opening it up

551
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:40,690
to questions so if anyone's got any

552
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:42,340
questions go ahead oh no you just to say

553
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,710
that thank you for the presentation

554
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,158
I think you have a lot of information

555
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:49,809
the only thing that was missing is

556
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:53,350
talking from an expense I add in the

557
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:56,500
price company if for example on that

558
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,899
your company has one gig of 10 gigabit

559
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,230
network interface to the internet and

560
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:05,740
you receive for example a 70 you gave it

561
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,190
to us on your company which usually come

562
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,200
on now

563
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,919
so I think the biggest record is one

564
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,929
that 4 terabyte for it much the thing

565
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,630
that we were missing back then I was

566
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:19,780
needed to know is to know the phone

567
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:22,539
number of the ISP because sometimes the

568
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,789
ISP can sustain the attack you can

569
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:27,400
always contact him say you can block

570
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:29,679
this bot because luckily for us those

571
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,320
are scary but where you are usually

572
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,179
focused on whom as you mention UDP ports

573
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,399
so if you can report to the SP please

574
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:37,840
block copies of our company that's a

575
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,130
good thing to know as if you don't know

576
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,789
the phone number or the game you know

577
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:45,250
the number is not available

578
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:48,190
yeah I think I I'm actually I used to

579
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,870
seven is two zero zero seven what

580
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,140
compliance oh yes and your disaster

581
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:56,049
recovery plan you should actually have

582
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:58,720
the various numbers and ISP would be one

583
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,908
of those to basically shut down the

584
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,059
attack and that complies move I'll riff

585
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:05,980
see I am calm as a number but that also

586
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:09,428
request that ISPs are actually the front

587
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,669
line so yeah thanks for reminding me any

588
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:11,669
more questions

589
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:25,210
you mentioned the tour is now a popular

590
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:30,170
entry or a start point for attacks

591
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:32,660
besides I can recall tour was always

592
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,090
pretty slow and not very efficient in

593
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:39,140
delivering time back to a single end

594
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,639
point just curious if that if tour is

595
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,760
actually not powerful enough for that

596
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,700
okay I would view it more in the case of

597
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,910
if you're looking at some of your slow

598
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:52,340
type attacks your layer 7s your things

599
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,020
like slow loris really that sort of

600
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,649
thing where you're sending packets very

601
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,710
very slowly in multiples of those if you

602
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,640
can do that from multiple tour endpoints

603
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,890
scattered all over the world

604
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,390
you're still opening I've been using up

605
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:08,210
all those requests it doesn't require

606
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:10,610
much input also if you're using tor at

607
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,920
that point to come in as your starting

608
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:15,409
point for then an amplification and

609
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:19,490
reflection attack it takes place after

610
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:22,310
that you're masking your origin to quite

611
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:25,310
a high degree and then still performing

612
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:28,040
a significant attack so if you can cut

613
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,440
that if you don't need to use it for

614
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,600
your site and your services you can

615
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,760
block it if you do that's a different

616
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,770
matter but it's just one of many

617
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,420
mitigations you can't I'm a strong

618
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:41,120
believer in defense-in-depth and you

619
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,840
can't rely on just one magic bullet that

620
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,250
fixes everything

621
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,439
so thanks thanks for the talk sir I

622
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:52,240
noticed one thing you didn't talk about

623
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:55,240
was services like Akamai and cloud fair

624
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,020
or maybe I missed it I was sleeping from

625
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,020
but um I

626
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:12,179
okay I must have missed it sari was

627
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:13,500
hidden away and do you think that I mean

628
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,240
those are very good for layer seven like

629
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,290
you said right it's layer seven

630
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,910
protection you're protecting your

631
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,740
application if you log on organization

632
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,240
you really this is probably what you

633
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,340
need do you think we need to take that

634
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,590
concept down another level and actually

635
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:30,240
start looking at layer 3 protection are

636
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:32,330
the same in the same methodology or do

637
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,580
you think we'll never get there because

638
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,500
networks are inherently distributed and

639
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,100
you don't want to go through a single

640
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,190
point of failure

641
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,139
I think level you could take it down

642
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,720
there it depends again on the size of

643
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,420
your organization so you would still

644
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,730
look to do things like blocking

645
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,950
controlling a lot this traffic at your

646
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,420
editors at your firewalls depending on

647
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,780
the size of the organization you might

648
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,490
run your own internal BGP between

649
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:01,830
multiple sites multiple data centers so

650
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:05,880
yes at that point you could do implement

651
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:09,300
this a lot of these services and block

652
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,790
things like broadcasting and people who

653
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:18,180
tried to send spoofed IP addresses at

654
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:19,350
source if you're in there I actually had

655
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,450
a follow-up question but different

656
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,790
question if you had something to add as

657
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,740
I said you can add various requests for

658
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,810
comments I actually asking people if we

659
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,940
if you could implement some simple

660
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:34,290
things like not forward in illegitimate

661
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:36,090
packets there are IDs and other things

662
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,649
like that are coming along a long way

663
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:41,399
since blocking in network but you have

664
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:44,640
problems with so you could block say

665
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,710
your internet but what about Wi-Fi what

666
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,140
about all the other networks how do you

667
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,740
jump over and you've got 6lowpan

668
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,930
I have you've got a problem there where

669
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,330
encryption problems with they symmetric

670
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,090
or asymmetric encryption of for IOT

671
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:02,580
devices asymmetric beam to a much data

672
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:04,649
but symmetric how do you do your

673
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,360
handshake can stop Alice from admit

674
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:10,440
sorry from listening to it so you've got

675
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,850
problems the ideal would be your layouts

676
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,070
network clone

677
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,658
block him but there are problems which

678
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,129
relate to the various different types of

679
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:19,109
technology but I think we should aim for

680
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:20,459
the ideal it's just because it's

681
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:24,228
difficult doesn't mean it we shouldn't

682
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,029
try to get there so my other question is

683
00:32:24,229 --> 00:32:28,649
do you think about large organizations I

684
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,720
mean a lot of times nowadays you're

685
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:32,998
outsourcing you're probably hosting your

686
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,919
data centers and collocations like if

687
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:37,649
you actually looked at the potential

688
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,049
impact of having multiple customers in a

689
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:50,879
colocation site where one customer is

690
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:53,129
the target of an attack okay in that

691
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:57,779
case once again if you're running

692
00:32:53,129 --> 00:33:00,478
something like anycast rating or a CDN

693
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:02,549
service at a point in your coalos you

694
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,940
can distribute that traffic around

695
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:07,830
between your different sites you can

696
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,479
almost isolate it because you've put I

697
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,668
assume you're using them with different

698
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:13,919
customers in that case they're different

699
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:15,509
parts of the cloud model and they're so

700
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,859
essentially you're different talents and

701
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:19,590
they've isolated off so you can actually

702
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:21,599
shift tendencies and migrate those to

703
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,759
different locations to handle that

704
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,739
everything you need to maybe be a little

705
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:29,099
bit creative and look at your logs as

706
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:32,429
nothing and have them in network admin

707
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:38,189
and security admin who are on before but

708
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:39,419
yes that can be done I think it's

709
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,340
covered most things the only thing I

710
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:46,080
would say is you should have redundancy

711
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,899
and failover so if you're having traffic

712
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,509
coming to one site try and failover

713
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:52,889
that's what it's there for and that will

714
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:55,590
help there are other things that you can

715
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:57,029
do higher up in your design but throws

716
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,529
into a lot of information maybe we can

717
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:59,999
talk about that afterwards but I

718
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:02,279
submitted the paper that's gonna be

719
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:04,559
talked about in South Africa covering an

720
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:12,089
awful lot of that from various different

721
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:14,969
layers so maybe later so thank you for

722
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:18,089
mentioning response rate limiting but I

723
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:20,638
have two observations and could use help

724
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:24,058
from this audience in both the first is

725
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,960
it's not the default either for bind or

726
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:28,409
for

727
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,839
NST Norfolk powered DNS the vendors are

728
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:34,409
waiting for you the users to insist on

729
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:38,250
the it being the default and the second

730
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:40,500
is DNS is not the only service which

731
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,879
must be open in some cases and so it

732
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,260
turns out a lot of other things need

733
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:48,558
some kind of rate limiting and in the

734
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,000
perfect world that is along that path

735
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:55,200
everything has rate limiting which means

736
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,410
we have maybe a billion times more state

737
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:02,189
in the network than we have today and

738
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:06,390
that state has cost in both CPU time and

739
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:09,050
RAM and complexity and diagnostics in

740
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,509
other words that path leads to hell and

741
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:15,450
RRL is very much a band-aid until we can

742
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:18,809
find some way to get b/c p-38 the source

743
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:21,540
address the filtering at the far end

744
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:26,069
where there is no economic reason to do

745
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:30,440
it so we're pushing on a rope and I I

746
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:33,180
would love it if we could push harder

747
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,960
Europe in particular seems to be willing

748
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:39,118
to use prior restraint in regulation you

749
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,010
might consider what Finland does done

750
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,040
where it is illegal to not have source

751
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,839
address filtering and possibly the rest

752
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,029
of Europe could adopt that also thank

753
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,650
you

754
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,589
thank you that's actually a very valid

755
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:55,589
point that the push for legislation

756
00:35:51,589 --> 00:36:02,630
cashy force change so yes that's very

757
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:02,630
useful and anyone else

758
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,320
okay thank you very much
