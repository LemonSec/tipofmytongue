1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,790
thank you thank you for the interaction

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,590
and thank you all for joining me today

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,240
really appreciate it thank you very much

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,929
the organizers as well it's a pleasure

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,400
to be here

6
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,900
I've never been to Luxembourg before and

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,100
absolutely loved it so far so thank you

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,320
today we'll be talking about the Verizon

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,230
data breach investigation report here's

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,340
a brief agenda for the day or the next

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,990
45 minutes at least

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,470
first we'll talk about briefly what the

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,810
VD BIR is I'll call it the full name VD

14
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,910
BIR the report kind of all of those

15
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,289
interchangeably let's talk about some of

16
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,748
the top trends that are focused on in

17
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:39,070
the report hot industries this is all

18
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:40,960
things that are these are all things

19
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,519
that Verizon defines then I'm going to

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,870
talk about some defensive techniques and

21
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:49,289
we'll open it up for some discussion

22
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:52,059
afterwards so what is the VG Br

23
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,600
this is the 11th year of the report just

24
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:54,248
a quick note

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,579
it's the 2018 report and so that's

26
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:59,739
focusing on 2017 s data I like to think

27
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,659
of it as kind of a pseudo-random meta

28
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:03,399
threat intelligence report the

29
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:06,220
pseudo-random nature of it is defining

30
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,780
where the data comes from there are

31
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,939
three main repositories that Verizon

32
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,770
calls the biggest one and the one that

33
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:13,298
has the most confidence in terms of the

34
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,460
rice and reporters when they're creating

35
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:19,750
the report is from their own third-party

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,699
investigations so this isn't to say

37
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,409
Verizon's breached every single year

38
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,930
that's kind of a misnomer I think

39
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,130
sometimes when the report comes out

40
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,320
Verizon has an enterprise security team

41
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,530
that does Incident Response in forensics

42
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,109
much like any other kind of mandiant

43
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,250
type of functionality if an organization

44
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,780
feels like they have an issue they can

45
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,539
bring in Verizon and they'll do a triage

46
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,189
and investigation so a Verizon uses the

47
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:46,049
various framework Varys is the

48
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:49,990
vocabulary for event reporting and

49
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,090
information sharing it's a great

50
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,469
framework I've used it in the past and

51
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,929
previously in the list positions outside

52
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:57,428
of I've never worked for a Verizon but I

53
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:59,289
didn't even know that they created it

54
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:01,929
until I came across that in the report

55
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,850
but it's a great way to classify and

56
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,570
categorize investigations and breaches

57
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,799
the second repository of data is

58
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,840
investigators that are not part of

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,450
Verizon's enterprise security teams that

60
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,099
submit their data to Verizon already in

61
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,890
the various framework so that kind of

62
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,530
has ii love

63
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,149
of confidence moving one down verizon

64
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,470
also has very good relationships with

65
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,569
independent researchers in the field

66
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,240
that don't use varus at all they'll go

67
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,380
and talk to them get kind of a sample of

68
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,150
different investigations that they've

69
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,660
been working on and Verizon will

70
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,520
integrate that into the Bears framework

71
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,620
so focusing on the meta nature of the

72
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,810
report we're not looking at specific

73
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,570
techniques in a single incident throw

74
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,480
over 53,000 incidents that Verizon

75
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,400
classifies in this report 2,000 of which

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,049
turned into actual breaches and the

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,300
distinction there is that an incident is

78
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,100
anything that affects the CIA triad

79
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,170
so confidentiality integrity and

80
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,329
availability of a system whereas a

81
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,130
breach is as I put it data walking out

82
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,709
the door so that's the kind of final and

83
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,930
Dalby all at RSA I've worked in our

84
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,060
Cirque and we talk about incidents

85
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,250
versus declared incidents so that's kind

86
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,950
of the divide or division between the

87
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,260
two threat intelligence is pretty

88
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,299
self-explanatory freising produces this

89
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,549
report in the hopes that we can all as

90
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,540
an industry learn from the incidents

91
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,660
that have happened in the past and

92
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,310
hopefully prevent them in the future why

93
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,670
does this matter why does this report

94
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,370
matter

95
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,679
well marketing material I mean that's

96
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,120
it's a joke but it is quoted pretty much

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,709
everywhere and so it's good to

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,049
understand the actual data because

99
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:36,530
different vendors including my employer

100
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:39,140
will twist the statistics in this report

101
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,299
to whatever need they they would like to

102
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,600
fill so it's very good to understand the

103
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:47,120
report as the data itself that being

104
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,590
said it is a great way to translate some

105
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,810
of what's going on in our industry to

106
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,380
lay people it's very palatable very easy

107
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:57,739
to read from a non security minded

108
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,180
expertise additionally and I think most

109
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:03,500
important to me is that it's very

110
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:06,019
difficult to get kind of impartial data

111
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,459
sets of breaches from wide range of

112
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:10,519
different verticals and industries and

113
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,590
so I look to Verizon and mandiant has

114
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,500
their m trends report every year as very

115
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,459
good sources for this I wish in our

116
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,810
industry we had more of those but I

117
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,210
think it's hard to monetize them that's

118
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,860
probably why

119
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,659
doctrines so there are a number of top

120
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,310
trends throughout the Verizon data

121
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,080
breach investigation report I'm only

122
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,210
going to focus on a few of the biggest

123
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,260
ones including social engineering

124
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,150
ransomware

125
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,670
we'll have a discussion discussion of

126
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,960
insider versus outsider threats then

127
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,390
we'll talk about dwell time and

128
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,039
cryptocurrency mining was pretty much

129
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,659
completely absent in the Verizon data

130
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,400
breach investigation report so we'll

131
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,890
have a brief discussion about why that

132
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,880
may be the case so social engineering I

133
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,870
think we can all agree that social

134
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,690
engineering is a pretty prevalent

135
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,680
problem in our industry especially

136
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:04,260
phishing basically at least two-thirds

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,580
of the incidents in the Verizon did

138
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,039
breach investigation report directly

139
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,090
come back to fishing and I think you

140
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,880
know it's it's pretty common knowledge

141
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,609
that it's much easier and oftentimes at

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,800
least to ask someone to hack a human as

143
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,090
opposed to hack an actual system so

144
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,000
that's very likely what's causing the

145
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,440
spike here using stolen credentials is

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,390
also the top of a list of data breaches

147
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,690
and again that goes back to the fact

148
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,460
that if you can you know get your way

149
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,350
into someone's head and get passwords

150
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,489
and information from them there's no

151
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,770
need to take a technical approach so

152
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,810
ransomware everyone's probably familiar

153
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,549
with the wanna cry attack if you're not

154
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,890
all you need to do is ask any one of

155
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,700
those companies and many more it did not

156
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,349
go well for them this was probably I

157
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,360
know as an industry we have a lot more

158
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,680
insight into the attacks but outside of

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,500
our industry this is probably one of the

160
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,240
biggest wake-up calls in recent years

161
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,250
which is often good for business for us

162
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,970
but it had some pretty damaging effects

163
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,800
not only did FedEx crawl to a halt but

164
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,870
the National Health Service of England

165
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,160
and Scotland were also heavily affected

166
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,080
as were some US hospitals so speaking of

167
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,150
the data that Verizon presented

168
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,260
regarding ransomware it was the number

169
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,479
one Avenue of malware or use of malware

170
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,510
across all the data set so represented

171
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,400
around 39 percent of attacks again

172
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,200
number one this year it rose from four

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,320
last year and it was all the way down to

174
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,419
22 in 2014 so ransom wares definitely

175
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,199
had a pretty fast increase in terms of

176
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,960
prevalence

177
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,939
we're also seeing more impact to

178
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,310
critical systems than ever before so it

179
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,419
looks like attackers are becoming a bit

180
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,789
more targeted and the ransomware

181
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,349
campaigns at least advanced and more

182
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:49,509
sophisticated attackers are doing some

183
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,069
recognizance and discovery to determine

184
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:53,909
what an organization's crown jewels are

185
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:56,169
and then infect those specifically

186
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,270
oftentimes that enables them to ask for

187
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,849
much higher payout as an organization

188
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,719
really you know relies on that data or

189
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,159
those systems in order to function

190
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:08,080
Rass as I call it ransomware as a

191
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,610
service is also another branch of

192
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,109
ransomware that's becoming increasingly

193
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,150
more prevalent there's an entire

194
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,550
industry being created around ransomware

195
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,719
this is more commodity based malware not

196
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,300
those targeted attacks that are

197
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:21,460
impacting business critical systems but

198
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,339
in these instances it's very easy to

199
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,128
access ransomware services and so they

200
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:29,259
traditionally have lower ransoms that

201
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:31,089
are asked of them but with the increase

202
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:34,949
in prevalence comes an increased costs

203
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:37,569
like we've never seen before email again

204
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:39,520
92% of ransomware was delivered via

205
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:41,409
email so I think it's clear at this

206
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,080
point that email isn't a infection

207
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:49,240
vector is incredibly popular for attack

208
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,500
campaigns so now let's move to a

209
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,710
discussion of internal versus external

210
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,860
threats this graph was pretty surprising

211
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,969
when I first saw it I don't know if I

212
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,229
was drinking too much of the kool-aid

213
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:01,240
when it comes to marketing but I think

214
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,930
we as an industry really overemphasize

215
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,909
insider attacks in truth only 27% of

216
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,389
attacks are insider the vast majority

217
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:11,498
are external threats there are a couple

218
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,330
of reasons I think this could be the

219
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:14,680
case there are definitely some popular

220
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,539
examples that we can all think of as

221
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,259
insider attacks whether that be Edward

222
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,330
Snowden

223
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,490
more recently reality winter in the

224
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,620
United States there's a lot of damage

225
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,449
that can be done by an insider insiders

226
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,879
often have privileged access to our

227
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,039
systems but as we spoke about previously

228
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,659
in social engineering it's very easy for

229
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:37,588
a an external actor to become an insider

230
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:40,929
through credential reuse and theft

231
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:43,329
something that I found remarkable was 4%

232
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,459
of users will click on any link that

233
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:47,910
they're presented with so even if it

234
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:51,119
says like danger danger this is bad

235
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,100
this will hack you please click they

236
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,110
will click before percent sounds

237
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,690
relatively small but that means in a

238
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,490
user base of 25 people someone's going

239
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,340
to be that individual that always clicks

240
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,720
on that link so this goes to a kind of

241
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,840
outside of the report but a different

242
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,610
mentality of designing systems secure by

243
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,380
default I think that's something that we

244
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,270
would really need to focus on in

245
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,939
security user training is great

246
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:19,260
awareness is amazing but it's it's not

247
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,720
solving the problem let's talk about

248
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,400
insider threats for a little bit the

249
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,330
vast majority of these are due to error

250
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,050
carelessness

251
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,610
so that rogue IT administrator really

252
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,469
doesn't happen that often it's

253
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,720
definitely a scary possibility and and

254
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,130
it does happen from time to time but the

255
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,070
vast majority of threats that we're

256
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,110
seeing are just kind of carelessness

257
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,940
I found it particularly interesting that

258
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,770
healthcare is the only industry that has

259
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,020
more prevalence of insider threats than

260
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,060
external and again the vast majority is

261
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,829
doing duty or carelessness and we'll

262
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,089
talk about that a bit more when I talk

263
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:57,210
about healthcare is one of the top

264
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:59,760
industries external threats vast

265
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,220
majority are financially motivated I was

266
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,740
surprised that only 50% were organized

267
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,960
crime syndicates I kind of expected that

268
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,330
to be a bit higher but the financial

269
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,310
motives are rife throughout any sort of

270
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,770
attack campaign and so you don't need to

271
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,750
be you know an organized crime syndicate

272
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,210
like you once did necessarily because

273
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,790
you can get a lot of these tools off the

274
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,500
internet now with very scripted type of

275
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:27,810
capabilities only 13% of the data set

276
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,980
was found incident incidents in the data

277
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,010
set were found to be a result of

278
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,080
espionage similarly only 12% of the

279
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,390
actors in the data set were advanced

280
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,550
persistent threats so I think much like

281
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,360
insider threats we focus a lot on our

282
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,979
industry on kind of apt apt apt

283
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,330
while that does happen and in public

284
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,310
administration as I'll talk about later

285
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,230
if you work for the government it is a

286
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,150
legitimate concern but in private

287
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,920
enterprise it's just not seen very much

288
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,110
this pretty much matches what I see in

289
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,240
the field when I'm doing Incident

290
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,040
Response and working on engagements it's

291
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,170
very rare that I'll see an incredibly

292
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,199
advanced sophisticated adversary

293
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,969
really maintaining that the persistence

294
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:08,758
I see a lot of persistent threats

295
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:16,079
through commodity malware but not many

296
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:17,609
advanced persistent threats 12-time this

297
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,498
is where we could all do a lot better

298
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:22,259
this is kind of an embarrassing slide

299
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:24,600
for us as an industry because 87% of

300
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:26,600
breaches happen or compromises rather

301
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,790
happened within minutes or seconds

302
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,549
whereas only 3% of the discovery happen

303
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,868
in a similar amount of time so in over

304
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:37,858
two-thirds of the cases the vast

305
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:41,160
majority it took months if not years for

306
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:43,769
incidences incidents to be discovered an

307
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,850
interesting corollary to this is working

308
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,389
for RSA no witness I often see

309
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,279
enterprises coming to me with a

310
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,549
requirement of 90 days of log retention

311
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,049
and so I think if we look at that number

312
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:57,358
most people quote about three months as

313
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,949
the typical dwell time but had actually

314
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:00,329
challenged that and say that we can only

315
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:02,488
see it for three months because you only

316
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:04,199
have those 90 days of logs it's very

317
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:07,470
likely that a attacker was inside of

318
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:10,349
your environment for much longer so it's

319
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,419
an interesting point I don't know what

320
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,489
that says about retention I think

321
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,230
instead of focusing on retention we need

322
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:19,730
to focus on visibility and getting out

323
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,730
in front of these issues much sooner

324
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:27,269
so cryptocurrency mining cryptocurrency

325
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:29,849
mining was mentioned in the Verizon data

326
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:31,470
breach report all the way 60 pages

327
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,559
through the report for the first time in

328
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:37,769
appendix D appendix D was their Year in

329
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:41,939
Review and so it kind of goes through

330
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:44,489
month by month the 2017 just mentioning

331
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:45,899
some of the most notable attacks eight

332
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:48,419
of those twelve months had

333
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,279
cryptocurrency mining so Verizon knows

334
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,539
that this is the thing it knows this is

335
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,850
an issue that we're facing in the field

336
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,739
but it wasn't mentioned at all in any of

337
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,529
the top trends really anywhere in the

338
00:12:55,739 --> 00:13:00,059
report other than that one appendix so I

339
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,160
think something is a bit off here I

340
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:05,160
don't think it's any maliciousness or

341
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,629
kind of turning a blind eye what I think

342
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,969
really happened and in talking something

343
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:11,850
with some colleagues most of them agreed

344
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,160
that takes a little bit for us to react

345
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,940
to a threat as sake analysts it then

346
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,740
takes even long

347
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,630
for our industry analyst to write and

348
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,250
report on them so I think it's just a

349
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,370
bit of a lag time that we're seeing here

350
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,810
my guess is that in the 2019 Verizon

351
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,760
day-trip data breach investigation

352
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,680
report cryptocurrency mining is going to

353
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,900
be front and center probably not

354
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,260
dethroning ransomware but way up there

355
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,910
in terms of the top trends looking

356
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,290
outside of the report I think it's just

357
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,689
logical to see cryptocurrency mining

358
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,520
increasing in prevalence not only do you

359
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,260
get immediate return on your investment

360
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,660
you can siphon out funds much quicker

361
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,790
especially at scale but it's also

362
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,520
relatively non-destructive if you're

363
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,949
doing it right or wrong from a defender

364
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,600
standpoint because it can be very easy

365
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,850
to fly under the radar if you're doing a

366
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,470
low and slow type of campaign you can

367
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,300
persist in the environment for months if

368
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,870
not years without anyone really noticing

369
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,910
that anything is going wrong there's

370
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,960
also an interesting thought that I had

371
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,150
when it came to cryptocurrency mining

372
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,490
I'd be interested to know if anyone in

373
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,860
the crowd has any kind of thoughts

374
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,330
towards this but the rise of the crypto

375
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,150
currency markets himself in terms of

376
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,920
financial gain and my personal

377
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,150
experience also kind of correlated to

378
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,920
the rise that I saw cryptocurrency

379
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,900
mining in the field and so I'm

380
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,189
interested to see now that the

381
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,140
cryptocurrency markets have kind of

382
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,040
dropped off if cryptocurrency mining is

383
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,960
no longer as prevalent as it once before

384
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,569
something else that has been talked

385
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,010
about is that the former actors of

386
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,260
ransomware campaigns have pivoted to

387
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,970
cryptocurrency mining that's not

388
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,740
necessarily what I've seen and not what

389
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,880
my colleagues have seen we still see

390
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,560
ransomware pretty prevalent

391
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,480
cryptocurrency mining is just now

392
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,920
supplementing that so on

393
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,110
business-critical systems if you have a

394
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,420
very advanced attacker do a ransomware

395
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,670
campaign otherwise if you have a whole

396
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,060
bunch of hosts cryptocurrency mined in

397
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,560
them

398
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,560
and do that low and slow gain over time

399
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,360
so now let's focus on some hot

400
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,310
industries Verizon breaks up the report

401
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,690
into I believe 12 different industries

402
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:14,000
but we're just gonna focus on a couple

403
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:16,710
of the most important ones so healthcare

404
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,020
healthcare is the only industry where

405
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:22,110
again insider threats are more prevalent

406
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,810
than external threats however human

407
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,280
error is a major contributor again that

408
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,300
element of error and carelessness is

409
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,510
incredibly rife within healthcare

410
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,680
I think as an American at least I can't

411
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,960
speak for the European health care

412
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,660
system which tends to be much better but

413
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,850
when I go to the doctor between doctors

414
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,959
nurses administrators there are infinite

415
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,030
number of systems that they need to

416
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,190
touch on a daily basis just to get their

417
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,990
work done they're also not necessarily

418
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,090
the most technical technologically savvy

419
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,310
individuals nor should they necessarily

420
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,450
need to be but this is probably what's

421
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,420
causing a lot of the error and

422
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,310
carelessness here one thing to note with

423
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,400
an employee employee abuse though is

424
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,229
that around 40 to 50 percent of the

425
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,420
insider threats in healthcare are due to

426
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,220
employee abuse these are things like if

427
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,380
a celebrity was treated at one of your

428
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,240
health care institutions employees are

429
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,640
very likely going to go in and try and

430
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,050
find information not necessarily to

431
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,790
monetize it but just purely out of

432
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,209
interest thought that was relatively

433
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,400
interesting Chervin in terms of external

434
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,070
threats ransomware is huge in health

435
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,240
care I don't know if you heard but

436
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,430
Atlanta the city of Atlanta and Georgia

437
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,790
and New York or Georgia in the United

438
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:33,459
States suffered from a huge ransom or

439
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,189
attack it mostly focused on government

440
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,530
institutions such as health care police

441
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,090
critical infrastructure so you know

442
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,860
locking up patient records that it

443
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:46,900
comfort so that an organization can

444
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:49,510
treat patients is a huge concern public

445
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,449
administration so this is where apt

446
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:55,120
matters in public administration public

447
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,760
sector over 40% of the breaches were

448
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,280
caused by advanced persistent threat

449
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,560
actors relatively nation-state actors

450
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,050
and so whether it's critical

451
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,690
infrastructure such as voting industrial

452
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:11,139
control more and more in the future

453
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:12,730
we're looking at connected cities spies

454
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,310
are definitely inside of our

455
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,440
infrastructure in America we often focus

456
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,919
on the Russians but I would firmly hold

457
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,950
the American intelligence apparatus are

458
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,550
firmly in a lot of other foreign nations

459
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,660
infrastructure so it goes both ways and

460
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,399
it's something that we definitely need

461
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,830
to keep an eye on if you're in any

462
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,450
industry but Public Administration

463
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,610
advanced persistent threats again not a

464
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,300
big concern this is where you do need to

465
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,300
pay attention to them

466
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,189
so the financial industry I'm very proud

467
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,370
and that I have a lot of customers that

468
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,840
are financial enterprises and they are

469
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,459
doing quite well these days they're the

470
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,340
only organization over the past three

471
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,049
years to show a reduction in incidence

472
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,139
and in fact it's a pretty dramatic

473
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:59,940
reduction the current threats these days

474
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,620
are mainly physical whether it's ATM

475
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,179
card skimming you hear that a lot about

476
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:08,850
at gas stations or Bakke bank ATMs or

477
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:11,010
ATM jackpot Eng Barnaby jacked the

478
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:15,559
famous ATM jack potting at blackhat in

479
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,559
2010 still incredibly current today

480
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,510
education education is a interesting

481
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,980
industry when it comes to this report

482
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:25,440
because over ten percent of the attacks

483
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,840
in education listed fun as the primary

484
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,460
motive that kind of gave me like a warm

485
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,750
and fuzzy feeling inside because when I

486
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,880
was a student I was definitely doing

487
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,740
things I shouldn't be not a malice at

488
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,929
all but purely out of interest and

489
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,880
curiosity and so we still see that that

490
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:44,730
is ripe and alive in education these

491
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:47,159
days this is also a great graph because

492
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,740
it means absolutely nothing to me

493
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,650
if anyone in this in this audience can

494
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,440
determine a you know sensical trend out

495
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,179
of this I would love to hear it the one

496
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,980
nugget of gold that I kind of get from

497
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,809
this is you can make a lot of trends in

498
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,850
our industry as I'll talk about in the

499
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,649
defensive techniques section reports

500
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,510
such as these can be invaluable to your

501
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,850
organization but they're also certain

502
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,400
things that you can't make transitive so

503
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,320
if you're a defender in education you're

504
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,390
not gonna try and you know focus on

505
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,280
cyber espionage as your main attack

506
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,720
vector that you're protecting because

507
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,730
while that may matter one year it

508
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,980
clearly won't matter the next so you

509
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,960
need to take a very robust defensive

510
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,960
posture when you're in a field like this

511
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:34,200
so now going on to defensive techniques

512
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,360
visibility is one of the biggest things

513
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,330
that I wish I had more of when I was an

514
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,770
analyst in organizations when I talk

515
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,629
about visibility I'm not just talking

516
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,360
about logs I'm talking about network and

517
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,090
endpoint data as well logs are great for

518
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,110
getting that kind of knock at the door

519
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,629
kind of a little bit of information

520
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,740
about what's going on but it's really

521
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,679
the network and packet day

522
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,020
that our network and endpoint data that

523
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,200
I use in my investigations to do the

524
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,270
deep forensic look into what's going on

525
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,700
it's impossible to really get the entire

526
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:11,940
scope of the attack campaign surely from

527
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:13,440
logs so this is a great graph that

528
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,360
Verizon puts out in the data breach

529
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,059
investigation report if there's anything

530
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,469
that you see in the report if there's

531
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,960
only one thing you see I recommend you

532
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,910
take a look at this it's probably very

533
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,470
hard to see from here and so let's just

534
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,690
take a little look at a subset of that

535
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,679
so these are incidents of those four

536
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,800
industries that I talked about

537
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,210
previously and this just is going to say

538
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,490
that you really need to tailor your

539
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,950
defenses not only to your industry but

540
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:41,040
your specific environment so looking at

541
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,750
industry specific determine what threats

542
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,389
are most prevalent in your industry you

543
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,460
can do this using Verizon you can look

544
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,230
at you can take these kind of

545
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,640
overarching patterns and layer them on

546
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,650
top of something like miters attack

547
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,610
framework I'm a huge fan of that I

548
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,920
understand they're giving a training

549
00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:00,090
upstairs I'm pretty jealous that I'm not

550
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,980
in that but it's incredibly valuable to

551
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,970
do this type of intelligence whether you

552
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,550
have a dedicated threat intelligence

553
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,929
team in your organization or if you're

554
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:12,210
just layering it on top of some of your

555
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:13,800
hunting X exercises so for example if

556
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,210
you're in public administration you're

557
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,678
not gonna try and defend point-of-sale

558
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,900
systems that's just not where the

559
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,570
attackers are looking right now they

560
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,940
mean this in the future you know things

561
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:26,059
like DMV point-of-sale or Department of

562
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,200
Motor Vehicle and other sort of

563
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,270
institutions that have point-of-sale

564
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,280
systems but currently that's not what

565
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,510
they're going after

566
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,030
far more interested again in that cyber

567
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,379
espionage and that I didn't want to say

568
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:43,200
it that will be my one cyber for the

569
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:44,910
talk I promise you that so you also need

570
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,370
to maintain a security posture relevant

571
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,480
to your own organization and the the

572
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,399
kind of capabilities of your

573
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,140
organization manual had a great talk

574
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,720
earlier today in the top of the morning

575
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,059
talked a lot about process people and

576
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,340
technologies it's very much true for

577
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,530
this as well if you're a junior

578
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,209
organization and you have one intern on

579
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,790
your security team you're not going to

580
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,310
ask them to hunt all day so

581
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:11,010
if you don't have a sim you shouldn't

582
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:13,169
invest in AI machine learning deep

583
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:19,410
dreaming technologies that aren't really

584
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:21,210
gonna do much for you the last point is

585
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,890
I also highly recommend that

586
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,810
organizations create a report like this

587
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,760
for themselves doesn't need to be

588
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,679
anything external not nearly as robust

589
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,360
as Verizon does but there are two main

590
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,920
things that you can do here the first

591
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,540
and probably the most important is

592
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,640
baselining the attacks that you see in

593
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,159
your environment this will help you

594
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,780
fine-tune graphs like this and you can

595
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,390
layer your own data on top of someone

596
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,770
like Verizon's additionally it will give

597
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,690
you some ammunition to go to your board

598
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,070
of directors your executive team and

599
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,830
show what you've done

600
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,419
oftentimes in security I think we're you

601
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,360
know often ignored if we're not heard

602
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,530
and so being heard from normally means

603
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,699
knocking on someone's door that you

604
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,830
don't want to and having an awkward

605
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,450
conversation about a breach this is a

606
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,159
great way to kind of get ahead of those

607
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,080
conversations and show what you're doing

608
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,850
and the value that you're bringing to

609
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,510
the organization without necessarily

610
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:13,919
need to do that in incident

611
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:17,310
investigation scenario so multi-factor

612
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,710
authentication I had to do a little RSA

613
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:22,730
throw up here but what we're really

614
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:26,430
talking about today is Hardware tokens

615
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,380
Google had an amazing report where Krebs

616
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,520
had an amazing report on Google that

617
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,260
found that since they rolled out

618
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,690
Hardware tokens and they do actually use

619
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,640
GB keys there they haven't had this was

620
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,530
an early 2017 they rolled them out and

621
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,150
since then about a couple months ago

622
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,180
they haven't had a single incidence of

623
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,980
phishing amongst their 85,000 plus

624
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,840
employees so that's incredibly

625
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,520
impressive and rolling out something

626
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,429
like multi multi factor authentication

627
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,510
is relatively low overhead and so if you

628
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,400
can do that one thing in your

629
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:56,480
organization it's a great way to get out

630
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,480
ahead of the threats that we're seeing

631
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:03,959
finally just going back to basics

632
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,390
talking about like sysadmin 101 you

633
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,670
don't need to have you know the battle

634
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,980
starship from day one you can just start

635
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,170
patching and backing up we talked about

636
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,020
patching a lot and I know it's not often

637
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:19,020
as easy as it is said patch where you

638
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,850
can try to have some political pressure

639
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,879
bring awareness to why patching matters

640
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,439
and backup is very very easy I've never

641
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,670
seen an organization that has much

642
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,280
friction when they try and roll out a

643
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,020
robust backup plan that's gonna help you

644
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,180
very much so with those ransomware

645
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,250
campaigns instead of being to you know

646
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,810
hoard Bitcoin and have a special bank

647
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,720
account where your company has Bitcoin

648
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:42,830
on reserve just backup every night and

649
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,430
if you get hit go back to a clean copy

650
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:50,000
next thing is kind of CISSP 101

651
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:52,770
permissions so privileged suite

652
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,660
permissions of least privilege only give

653
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,940
people what they need access to to do on

654
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,950
a daily basis review those privileges on

655
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,800
a quarterly or at least yearly basis and

656
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,850
make sure that people are still

657
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,090
accessing the assets that they have

658
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,000
access to Netflix has a great program I

659
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:11,280
believe it's freely available on github

660
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,410
forget the name of it right now but it

661
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,620
will automatically roll way permissions

662
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:18,990
I'm kind of a roving random basis so if

663
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,000
someone complains very easily scripts it

664
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,230
and turns the permission back on but if

665
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,790
no one notices that they lost their

666
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,170
permission they probably shouldn't have

667
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:30,750
had it in the first place so that is the

668
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:35,730
entirety of my presentation any

669
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:39,510
questions at all I do have some

670
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:41,520
discussion topics just spur debate and

671
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,780
comments everyone is so opinionated in

672
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:55,530
our industry I can't believe no one has

673
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:57,240
a question or so you are correctly

674
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,649
pointing out the importance of patching

675
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,060
and allowing for a patch where you can

676
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:07,050
strategy if you if you can't patch

677
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:09,240
everything you know you should patch the

678
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:14,909
Delta there turns out to be really

679
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,650
important so energy spent auditing your

680
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,160
patching strategies so that you know

681
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:24,110
what isn't patched is actually got a

682
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,110
bigger payoff than patching what you can

683
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,000
thank you I think

684
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:31,080
incredibly salient point once you do

685
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,270
know what's not patched in your

686
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,679
environment by increasing the visibility

687
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,020
that you have there and increasing the

688
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,790
monitoring that can be almost as good as

689
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,110
patching something in the first place so

690
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,670
if you have a high valued asset in your

691
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,500
environment that you can't patch whether

692
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,440
it's critical infrastructure or legacy

693
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,720
system at least monitor the heck out of

694
00:26:46,440 --> 00:27:01,650
it because that's gonna give you a very

695
00:26:48,720 --> 00:27:04,170
high fidelity or return since she's not

696
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,850
here to mention it himself Michi occult

697
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,340
sec in Slovenia has a very interesting

698
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,189
protic called Oh patch I don't know if

699
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,470
you've seen it it's basically a micro

700
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,840
patch where he patches one single

701
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,880
machine instruction where the

702
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,980
vulnerability is so install an agent on

703
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,280
a server or workstation he pushes out

704
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:26,040
and a micro patch and the vulnerability

705
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,920
is gone until the actual patch can be

706
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:35,100
released or for unpassable things this

707
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:37,020
one is harmless interesting that the

708
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,429
project is called a patch and I'll

709
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,850
definitely need to look into that thank

710
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:43,110
you it will soon be available also for

711
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,730
enterprises with a subscription where

712
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,159
you can say for these types of devices

713
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,960
and applications I want to be sure that

714
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,610
there will be opiates available for this

715
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,170
and this and that

716
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:55,290
no that's great I can see a whole bunch

717
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:58,610
of practical application yeah thank you

718
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:01,980
for that anything else

719
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:04,110
did what Verizon saw and reported on

720
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,550
does that make sense so there's the the

721
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,820
top threats that you guys are seeing in

722
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:13,080
your enterprises you just give like a

723
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:17,429
yea or nay i I just have a question ho

724
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,199
do you use this report and actually do

725
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:23,580
you use the information that you find

726
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,250
here in New Delhi job yep I absolutely

727
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,189
do use this report I've been using the

728
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:33,390
report since around the fifth version I

729
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:36,330
think in late 2000s when I was a soccer

730
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:39,390
analyst and so I would absolutely look

731
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,470
at my industry look at the compromises

732
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,630
that are prep

733
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,730
and relate that back to the security

734
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,770
posture that I was defining so it's a

735
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,260
great way to kind of find holes that you

736
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,420
potentially have oftentimes we need to

737
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,950
be so reactionary in our jobs that it's

738
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,480
very difficult to stand back and take a

739
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,280
look at the real landscape what we're

740
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,010
essentially facing and so this was a

741
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,870
great kind of level setter for me you

742
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,370
know it's pretty beefy report but it

743
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,620
only takes a you know weekend to turn

744
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,780
through maybe once or twice and really

745
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,300
get some actionable intelligence from so

746
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,010
that was the goal today was just to kind

747
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,399
of distill a bit of that to you guys

748
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:22,170
hopefully you can take this back to your

749
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:25,290
enterprise yeah so so I just fell in so

750
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:27,450
I hope this question was not erased what

751
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,460
I was thinking and I would like to have

752
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,340
your opinion because I was just like

753
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,230
wondering would it make sense and I

754
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,409
don't know if any of you ever did that

755
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,900
since the horizon data Beach report is

756
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,910
now a de facto thing and you've every

757
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,920
time it comes out people just jump on it

758
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:47,070
and claim that they read it but usually

759
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,450
didn't at least they looked at the fancy

760
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,000
charts and whatnot

761
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:53,490
have you for example I don't know maybe

762
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,790
you Walter but maybe someone in the in

763
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:59,940
the participants have you guys ever used

764
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:02,159
the things that they list out there all

765
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,250
the metrics to measure it in your

766
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,530
environment and then compare it what you

767
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,360
have as an average there and would this

768
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,129
make sense since we're looking at so it

769
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,129
did are probably not the best metrics

770
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,760
but at least we have historical

771
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,310
representation of I think the most

772
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,870
common one is the time to detect thing

773
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,360
that usually that's the most like

774
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:23,459
referred one have you guys measuring

775
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,949
that because still in a lot of cases in

776
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,570
IR teams they're not really looking in

777
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:32,070
that one but they do something stupid

778
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:35,370
like the number of tickets so what would

779
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,780
this make sense what do you think yet

780
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,270
that that was actually something that I

781
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,030
mentioned that was that was kind of a

782
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,650
little golden nugget is is I encourage

783
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,180
you know all the companies that I work

784
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,560
with all my friends that work at

785
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,170
companies to develop these reports

786
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,740
internally again don't need to be

787
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,840
external at all but I don't know

788
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,150
a single company that has taken me up on

789
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,559
this that does publish it and they don't

790
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,559
certainly need to be as robust it for

791
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,540
aizen's but it's a great way to again

792
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,428
layer your own data on top of horizons

793
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,050
to kind of make it sense a little bit

794
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,760
more for you and to baseline your own

795
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,950
environment and so compared to what you

796
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,620
have in and as an average like are they

797
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,120
blow under like what is your experience

798
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,129
that they're doing better than the

799
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,959
average worse than the average are they

800
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,080
even honest

801
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,630
doing yeah so to speak to the honesty

802
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,309
real quick a friend of mine a couple

803
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,480
years ago took a job with Verizon

804
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:28,220
enterprise security and that was my

805
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,170
first question I was like are they

806
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,059
actually listening to you guys or is it

807
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,550
like a marketing like a Gartner type of

808
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:36,200
thing where they figure out what they

809
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,330
want to say and then put some statistics

810
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,250
behind it and he said that no the the

811
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,360
report writers are heavily embedded with

812
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,640
the enterprise security division of

813
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,229
Verizon and all of this data comes

814
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,540
straight from the investigations that

815
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:52,850
they do so I was very glad to hear that

816
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:55,928
the first part of the question in terms

817
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:59,149
of really making this your own I

818
00:31:55,929 --> 00:32:01,370
generally see a little bit of deviation

819
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,550
in some of the attack techniques that

820
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,169
are most used but the trends in terms of

821
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,550
the you know the top three or five

822
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,590
things that certain industries are

823
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,830
facing are generally dead-on you know

824
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:15,379
little standard deviation but I've been

825
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,530
pretty impressed not only with kind of

826
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:21,380
this year's report but historically how

827
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:22,730
well lay chart some of some of the kind

828
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,500
of trends in the industry and there's a

829
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,000
really good companion site to the

830
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,679
Verizon data breach investigation report

831
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,830
that Verizon puts out that has all sorts

832
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,440
of visualizations that you can interact

833
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:35,899
with and modify to kind of even make it

834
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,080
more your own I'm still waiting for them

835
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:41,000
I've been trying to work with them to

836
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,710
open-source some of the engines that

837
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,020
they used to create the report so that

838
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,570
it's easier for organizations to take it

839
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:50,600
at their own data and have a a private

840
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,909
version they of course want that to feed

841
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,740
back into their cloud repository but I

842
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,510
don't think they'd get much traction you

843
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,880
know if that was the case so I'd love to

844
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,559
see them have kind of a you know offline

845
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,090
version of this that you can modify for

846
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,350
your own

847
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:11,149
I have a command again if I may um on

848
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:15,590
the kpi's and of like say the most cited

849
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:18,320
breach statistic a date there's a new

850
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,840
book out that I is on my Christmas wish

851
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,010
is that I really hope it's called that

852
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:27,439
works I win

853
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:30,140
top old book which is called time-based

854
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,090
security which according to him and

855
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,100
several Rob several of the people who

856
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:37,879
recommend the book online and in an in

857
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:41,178
the book itself is a new security

858
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,299
strategy that risk-based security by

859
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:46,429
mots be aware but I'm looking forward to

860
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:49,610
reading about it yeah that's really

861
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:51,770
funny I was a dinner with when a couple

862
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,840
of months ago and I hadn't heard of his

863
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:57,200
new project and he was talking about it

864
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,240
and it sounds amazing it sounds like it

865
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,630
could be you know we have a few cannons

866
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,710
in our industry type of go-to resources

867
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,809
but a lot of them are relatively

868
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,480
outdated at this point and so I'm very

869
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:10,969
excited to see it I was kind of probing

870
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,730
him to get a sneak peek and he shared

871
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:17,868
some things but I think I'll need to

872
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:21,379
wait until I get my own copy but I

873
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:22,730
believe it's out now right yeah yeah I

874
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:25,009
think it was released about a month or

875
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:28,909
two ago and so um yeah I should have

876
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,980
read it um so I'm still just jumping

877
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:33,589
back a bit what you say so you said that

878
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:37,790
some of your friends and you as well

879
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:40,009
started generating these numbers and

880
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:43,190
seeing how well you're doing compared to

881
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,960
the average how long they've been doing

882
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,668
it or how long you've been doing it and

883
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,109
how do you improve you managed to

884
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:52,699
improve on those numbers or any and also

885
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:54,168
is it more something that you show to

886
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,319
management so something more that you

887
00:34:54,168 --> 00:35:02,330
feed in as a more strategic thing or use

888
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:04,099
it more for your like tactical needs and

889
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:07,130
say that okay we're not doing well let's

890
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:09,670
improve on our processes and and try to

891
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,680
figure out better ways to detect

892
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,140
compromise yeah I think both are very

893
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,500
important I think from a tactical

894
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,960
perspective

895
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,820
of creating a report like this for your

896
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,380
own organization it's a great way again

897
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,020
to baseline you know you don't need a

898
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,090
machine learning algorithm to baseline

899
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,560
some of these simple statistics you can

900
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,700
just put them in an Excel spreadsheet

901
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,880
and see how it goes

902
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,319
year by year at the most simple basis

903
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,030
again it's also incredibly useful to

904
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,640
show to your management I spoke a little

905
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:39,170
bit previously about how security only

906
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,870
interfaces with the executive branch

907
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,730
during a breach oftentimes basically

908
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:45,080
when things go wrong so this is a great

909
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,550
way to get out ahead of that and show

910
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,100
the productiveness of your division

911
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,800
within an enterprise without needing to

912
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:54,470
kind of have a black eye in the process

913
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,000
in terms of the longevity and how long

914
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,669
I've seen people creating their own

915
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,060
versions I work with one customer who

916
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:04,030
didn't even need my recommendation

917
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:07,850
during an engagement I present my report

918
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:10,400
they gave me historical report believe I

919
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,750
went back around five years so they've

920
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,490
been doing this for for quite a long

921
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,470
time and what they've done now is

922
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,569
they've integrated it with their soar

923
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,370
platform their security orchestration

924
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,110
and automation response platform to

925
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:23,390
automate a lot of the collection of

926
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:26,300
these these statistics so things like

927
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:28,549
meantimes resolution they have a little

928
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,730
bash lit in the top corner of their sock

929
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:34,010
manager dashboard so they can always see

930
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,750
where they are in their SLA is the

931
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,120
analysts don't necessarily love that

932
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,460
because it's very easy to profile them

933
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:44,270
and see who's doing work and who's not

934
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:47,510
but it's it's a great way to help

935
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,450
improve even within a sock perspective

936
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:52,100
you know if analyst X deals with certain

937
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,720
incidents much better and analyst Y

938
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,130
deals with other incidents much better

939
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,310
it's a great way to kind of optimize

940
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:01,490
workflows so that's from a more tactical

941
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:03,049
soft perspective I do have organizations

942
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,660
I've started writing my Incident

943
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:09,380
Response reports in more of a framework

944
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:11,839
like this talking about trends TTP's and

945
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,460
then vertical specific intelligence that

946
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,170
I kind of layer on top of what I've seen

947
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,510
in their environment and then I

948
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,730
encourage them I leave portions blank

949
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,950
kind of a template for them things that

950
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,240
I didn't have the purview on but I

951
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,299
encourage them to fill out and then

952
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,939
maintain that year after year I think

953
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,920
proactive hunting has become a big thing

954
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,750
whether specific to an environment or if

955
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,329
you bring in a third party to do it was

956
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,550
kind of an incident response discovery I

957
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:39,950
would highly encourage folks to do that

958
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,359
I've been a part of a number of those

959
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,339
where companies have been going through

960
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,380
mergers and acquisitions before they

961
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:47,210
flip that switch and let the newly

962
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:51,050
acquired company into their network they

963
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:52,970
do not necessarily a pen test and not

964
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,530
really a vulnerability scan kind of a

965
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,049
mixture of the two or they do a

966
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:59,510
proactive defensive exercise to see

967
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:01,550
exactly what's going on in that that

968
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:08,089
property before they bring it into the

969
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:09,710
into the castle that answer yeah well

970
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:11,630
this is getting back in in terms of

971
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,099
improvement are they able to I'm not

972
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,349
saying that they should you know strive

973
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:17,630
for just moving the needle but they're

974
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:21,020
really able to because once you see

975
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,349
these data then you realize that your

976
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:27,020
might not doing as well as you thought

977
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:30,319
are they have in their program once they

978
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,750
started measuring these a point where

979
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,700
they try to improve on that and if they

980
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,980
were able to do that so for example in

981
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:40,460
one case like the the mean time to

982
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,560
detect dropped in the past few years a

983
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,230
lot of people tie that to the fact that

984
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,020
now ransomware was was a thing

985
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:51,290
so they take into teasing into account

986
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:54,020
as well but it so how did it improve on

987
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:56,420
it that would be interesting for me yeah

988
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,650
I've definitely seen improvement I think

989
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,200
the biggest way that I've seen

990
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,240
improvement is budgetary if you have a

991
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,890
report like this explaining exactly what

992
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,319
the trends are your environment you can

993
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:08,000
take that to leadership and say you know

994
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:10,009
this is the justification for this

995
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,930
technology yeah giving giving them

996
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,280
actual numbers yeah instead of just

997
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,618
saying that we need more money yeah

998
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,089
exactly but I have seen it improve with

999
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,190
training as well so if you're an

1000
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:21,500
organization that's facing you know four

1001
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,990
different threats and you see one of

1002
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,190
them is affecting you a lot more that's

1003
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,319
a good indication that your knowledge

1004
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,390
base is lacking in that one area from a

1005
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:30,950
defensive standpoint so whether you

1006
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,990
bring someone in who's an expert in that

1007
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:35,720
field or if you pollinate your own

1008
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:38,180
existing analysts with training I've

1009
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,589
seen that that work as well in one

1010
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,649
particular example someone was getting

1011
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:43,359
nailed with web application stuff

1012
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,369
they had no idea was coming in through

1013
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,589
that vector they thought it was a much

1014
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:49,480
different type of attack and so they

1015
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:53,170
schooled up one of their analysts

1016
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,180
actually through sans training and that

1017
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:58,119
didn't make a market decrease in that

1018
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:01,299
attack vector it was also a very limited

1019
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,460
actor so I think just recognizing it in

1020
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:05,259
the first place was a big step forward

1021
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,470
for them but then to have those

1022
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,730
technical chops on your team prevents

1023
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,910
those types of things from happening in

1024
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,910
the future

1025
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:26,319
so no other questions yeah sure it's a

1026
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:30,029
good topic so a few years ago they

1027
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:35,079
changed the way that they presented the

1028
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:38,859
top vulnerabilities used to compromise

1029
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,900
companies and the data that went into

1030
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:42,848
the report was totally wrong every

1031
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,529
single vulnerability in there was wrong

1032
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:46,210
they messed it up somehow

1033
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:49,299
I think they republished with the

1034
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:51,630
correct vulnerabilities but then in the

1035
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:54,670
last one they took this out entirely

1036
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:57,279
which data which I found interesting and

1037
00:40:54,670 --> 00:41:01,510
relevant because I can also tie it to

1038
00:40:57,279 --> 00:41:03,339
the OS 10 which someone just analyzed in

1039
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,480
the respect of which vulnerabilities

1040
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:06,279
were actually used to compromise

1041
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,740
companies again similar to what we rise

1042
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:10,510
and wanted to do and stop doing what do

1043
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,520
you think of Verizon taking out data

1044
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:16,029
from this report that some of us

1045
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,990
consider valuable yeah that to be

1046
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:20,289
completely honest that was very

1047
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:22,509
disappointing for me as well it is in

1048
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:24,970
the report here and there and some of

1049
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,470
the appendices the online companion tool

1050
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,149
actually does the best way of kind of

1051
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,410
getting to the granularity of the actual

1052
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:35,770
tactics and techniques that are being

1053
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:38,109
used I think so my perspective on that

1054
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:41,109
and correct me if you have a different

1055
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:43,450
one what I saw happening was a lot of

1056
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:46,180
attribution being surrounded by those

1057
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:50,770
certain tactics and techniques so if you

1058
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:53,348
saw a certain you know rootkit let's say

1059
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:54,890
being used there was such a media focus

1060
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:58,040
now in our industry that

1061
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:59,470
they'd initially oughta automatically

1062
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,790
pretty much assign a specific

1063
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:04,700
attribution to that you know this was

1064
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,870
North Korea and I think you know we can

1065
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,029
probably all agree that's incredibly

1066
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,670
dangerous attribution is not a game that

1067
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:14,060
I ever want to play due to a number of

1068
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:16,250
factors but that's kind of where I

1069
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,990
sensed it going in terms of Verizon no

1070
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:21,440
longer wanted to put their name behind

1071
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:23,479
this as this technique equals this

1072
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,220
person they certainly weren't making

1073
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,840
that jump in the report but I think a

1074
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,580
lot of the media attention started going

1075
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,340
there where they're saying Verizon

1076
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,290
saying that you know fancy bear is using

1077
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,330
this against these industries that's not

1078
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,860
what they were doing but it was easier

1079
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,830
and easier as more of these techniques

1080
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,330
we're getting associated with actors to

1081
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,509
make those leaps in popular media at

1082
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,259
least that I do wish there was a good

1083
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,830
resource for that

1084
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:51,110
I think mitre has really kind of filled

1085
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:55,190
that gap the attack framework does have

1086
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:57,560
pretty good granularity sometimes too

1087
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,240
much granularity when I show it to some

1088
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,799
of my you know customers they're like

1089
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,689
wow this is like a hundred and twenty

1090
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,250
eight boxes like can we get like four

1091
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:09,020
there's definitely value immense value I

1092
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,320
think in the granularity that they they

1093
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:14,420
take it but some middle ground at least

1094
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,300
for you know director manager levels

1095
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,830
would be appreciated

1096
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,240
yeah I think that was the ohi's featured

1097
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,520
that in the executive summary so not

1098
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,589
only was it in the full report but even

1099
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,320
if you had you know somewhat of a lay

1100
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,580
person without really who doesn't live

1101
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,630
and breathe security like we do they

1102
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:42,160
could still easily digest those TTP's

1103
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:42,160
yeah and you know question clouds no

1104
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:53,870
yeah we still have fifteen minutes so

1105
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:55,250
who are not vents on the break okay so

1106
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,560
thank you Walter

1107
00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:02,380
thank you guys

1108
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,380
[Applause]
