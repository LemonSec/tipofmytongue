1
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:12,259
good afternoon I hope I'm not gonna talk

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,890
in a way that gets annoying because of

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,860
this sound I'm glad to see so many of

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,980
you back after the lunch I hope you guys

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,980
can stay awake otherwise I will throw

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,350
some stuff into the audience first of

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,440
all a really short question because I'm

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,599
used to speak to audiences who are quite

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,879
familiar with a zippe already but I have

10
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:37,699
the feeling that not everybody knows as

11
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:41,318
ap maybe can I see some hands who knows

12
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:45,159
as ap as a as a vendor

13
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:49,940
okay that's already quite comforting any

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:52,429
of those people are they are you working

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,809
with sa P also in your company can I see

16
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:57,699
some hands of the people who work with

17
00:00:53,809 --> 00:01:01,458
as you P in our company that's already

18
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:03,108
less alright I want to make this as

19
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:05,659
interactive as possible so guys if you

20
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:10,180
have any questions just feel free to

21
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,180
shout or scream or whatever

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:18,800
yeah well I'm yours a short introduction

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,650
I work with a zippe for quite some time

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,500
already I did an implementation for the

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,940
Ministry of Defense like 11 years ago

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:31,100
and by then I started doing more into

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:34,550
security specifically related to s AP

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:38,149
and I also do SP security related

29
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,460
research and found like 70 over 70

30
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,560
filner abilities in SP software that

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,380
sounds like a lot and it is if you know

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,070
how simple they are to find you would be

33
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,810
amazed yeah

34
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:56,300
first of all the head off to the

35
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:59,659
Luxembourg hackers they already captured

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,250
our national flag like I don't know two

37
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,050
hundred years ago so that's some

38
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,420
next-level that capture the flag

39
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,000
well done guys

40
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:11,470
okay a short introduction about a zippy

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,720
it's one of those monolithic big

42
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,900
enterprise applications that in general

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,350
people don't want to touch because if it

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,290
breaks it might break your company quite

45
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,109
often it stores all your business

46
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,299
critical data it's used for automating

47
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,209
those processes that are really in the

48
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:36,040
core of your enterprise like logistics

49
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:39,170
like seals like production like whatever

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,200
their range of functionality is really

51
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:46,579
broad they have over three hundred

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:53,660
thousand customers worldwide and they

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:56,570
say that of every yeah 74 percent of the

54
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,480
world's financial transactions touching

55
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:02,600
as ap system somewhere so this stuff is

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,320
huge it's not that visible always within

57
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,090
companies but the bottom line is it's an

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,690
interesting target because it stores

59
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,540
everything about everyone about every

60
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:22,730
thing the company does in one database

61
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:29,269
often a short history introduction on sa

62
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:33,109
P they have a lot of background in the

63
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,989
financial world and in big corporate

64
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:40,370
environments they are therefore already

65
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:43,400
like four years and big parts of the

66
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,709
code base that they use nowadays where

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,980
the current systems is already being

68
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,930
developed back in the 80s and the 90s in

69
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:56,209
a time where security was not that

70
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:58,280
relevant or important yet they did

71
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,769
something about that so over the past

72
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,780
couple of ten years they really really

73
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:07,640
improve purity for customers that do you

74
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,350
installations of sa P but all the

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,458
customers that are already running on as

76
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:15,709
a B for like 10 20 30 years they tend to

77
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,840
have all these old legacy and backlog in

78
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:22,730
their systems that they just can't

79
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:24,320
rid of quite simple the thing is like I

80
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:29,180
mentioned as we did a lot to improve

81
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:32,630
security but quite late that's because

82
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:35,270
they they missed the boat so to say in

83
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,050
the whole internet connected world like

84
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:41,030
you know the big companies like Google

85
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,669
already picked up quite early and and

86
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,859
they also worked a lot on security like

87
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:48,919
Microsoft and Google there are years

88
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:55,400
ahead of sa p as we try to catch up but

89
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:57,590
they are quite late we do a lot of ESPE

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,630
security related research we also

91
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,580
present about it there are some other

92
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,219
specialized companies in the world to do

93
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,289
that if you search for security

94
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,800
conferences where as u P topics are

95
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,840
discussed that's quite a lot these are

96
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,150
just some examples maybe some people

97
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,750
here have been to troopers before in

98
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:20,359
Germany Klaus knows that it's a security

99
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:24,380
conference with a dedicated SP security

100
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,590
track which is quite unique this was my

101
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:32,060
presentation lot here at HEC a lure also

102
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,400
about sa B so there are researchers

103
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,740
working on it and SP itself is also

104
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,090
doing a lot of code scanning and stop on

105
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:44,510
their code to improve things this

106
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:49,280
resulted in so-called recipe security

107
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:52,159
notes and as ap security notes are let's

108
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,090
say the same as your Microsoft security

109
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,900
updates these are small bug fixes small

110
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:06,909
patches to solve a small specific as it

111
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:10,609
be vulnerability there's over 4,000 ah

112
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:14,060
better and this number is increasing

113
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,750
each month as ap releases like 20 to 30

114
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,389
s AP security related notes on the same

115
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,330
Patch Tuesday as micro school as

116
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:25,280
Microsoft does

117
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,430
Microsoft and as it be as SP has aligned

118
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:33,169
to patch Tuesday to the Microsoft

119
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:36,560
release date something about the current

120
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:39,380
state many s AP customers are now aware

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,310
they should do something but that

122
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,080
awareness does not always lead to action

123
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,080
many SP running companies are still

124
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,620
really really lazy and slow in applying

125
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,419
patches because this SP system is often

126
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,710
so critical for them that they are quite

127
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,870
reluctant and afraid to touch it the

128
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,419
companies that do work on their SP

129
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,420
security are often a really big fortune

130
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:10,280
2,000 ones that do have a lot of money

131
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,600
and people and knowledge to do so yeah

132
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,640
and I want to mention that shortly

133
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,280
because the GD P R was already mentioned

134
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,840
by Elena before I think also for

135
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,900
hospitals that will have quite some

136
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,210
impact the same goes for these SE p

137
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:29,570
running companies because they often

138
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:33,859
process privacy specific data as well so

139
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:41,150
a lot will be needed to do to work on in

140
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:43,790
that area this is a list of 12 of the

141
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,060
most common vulnerabilities that we

142
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:50,270
found over the years we did as ap

143
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,000
security related assessments already I

144
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:56,690
think we already do that for six or

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,730
seven years and there's quite some high

146
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:05,230
risk stuff that we keep seeing keep

147
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,150
keeps see coming back all the time I

148
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:11,030
will not go through it in detail because

149
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,849
not everybody is aware of it but a lot

150
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:17,450
of these are really specific to sa P so

151
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:20,210
you can see this as you can compare it a

152
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:25,010
bit with let's say the wasp top 10 but

153
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:27,530
then specifically for sa P and I guess a

154
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,780
lot of those things will not say too

155
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,229
much to people from outside the SI p

156
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,839
world

157
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,000
but but what's the most important one

158
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,160
which come keeps coming back on number

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,559
one is missing

160
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,199
ASAP security notes some missing patches

161
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:49,770
and that's what I want that's the thing

162
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:52,050
I want to zoom in on today yeah this is

163
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,150
it this is related to a question I get a

164
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,040
lot because people say yeah well we

165
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,050
don't hear too often that sa P running

166
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,390
companies are in the news because they

167
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,270
got hacked well there are there are

168
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,430
definitely examples the thing is I think

169
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,689
in in in real life the number is much

170
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:11,099
higher because by default as a PE

171
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,590
running customers have all the logging

172
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,130
switched off so most customers wouldn't

173
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:20,100
even know if they got hacked and this is

174
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,280
a this is an example from maybe two

175
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,790
years ago where you sis which is a

176
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,560
private background investigative company

177
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,949
in the u.s. they do background checks

178
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,069
for the American government and they

179
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:38,400
were hacked as the story goes by the

180
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,420
Chinese it's not confirmed by the way

181
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,530
but yeah you know how those things go

182
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:48,780
they got hacked anyway and a lot of

183
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,810
important data about employees working

184
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,810
for the American government those

185
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:58,050
records were stolen which ultimately led

186
00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,000
to the United States government to to

187
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,520
stop the contract with this company with

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,420
this particular company which ended up

189
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:10,890
in this company going bankrupt and they

190
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:13,680
had like a three billion dollar contract

191
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,470
with the government so you can imagine

192
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,469
that this was killing for them and it

193
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,150
got them out of business so this is

194
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,390
quite a good example of things that can

195
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,390
go wrong

196
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:34,120
yeah well in general I we see this more

197
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,490
is that in general typically patches

198
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,180
that are provided by fenders are not

199
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:43,420
always applied soon enough a good

200
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,030
example is to Equifax heck of a couple

201
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:50,979
of months ago which could easily be

202
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:56,680
prevented by just applying patches the

203
00:10:50,980 --> 00:11:00,660
same goes for sa P systems they don't

204
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,680
apply patches for several reasons very

205
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,780
important one is that they don't apply

206
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,370
patches because that those systems are

207
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,040
so business critical that they need to

208
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,620
touch it test it thoroughly and if it

209
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,790
breaks anything it might really bring

210
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:19,600
your your complete business to a stop so

211
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:23,920
what we see typically is that they just

212
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:27,160
do a large upgrade every maybe year or

213
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,699
every two years and in between they do

214
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,620
nothing nothing at all so it's like it's

215
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,750
like your Windows operating system for

216
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:38,530
example it's it's similar if you would

217
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:40,750
say well I have Windows 8 let's wait

218
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,520
until Windows 10 is out then I'll do an

219
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,810
upgrade and in between I'm not going to

220
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,319
install any security patches that's not

221
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,030
good

222
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,900
but it happens a lot we see that

223
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:55,150
typically and another important thing to

224
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,250
mention is that as if you releases those

225
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,130
security patches on a regular basis on

226
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,910
the patch Tuesday the code is quite

227
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:07,270
easily reversed can be engineer a

228
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,800
reverse engineer the code is open it's

229
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,600
it's on there marketplace you can

230
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,689
download the patches and from there you

231
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,770
can easily reverse engineer what the

232
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:20,670
vulnerability is so that makes it extra

233
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:25,329
important to make sure that you patch

234
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:29,729
well those were the problems I want to

235
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:32,970
go and look quickly to some solutions

236
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,970
what we

237
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:38,930
what we hear a lot from customers why

238
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,019
they don't apply patches also is because

239
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:48,430
it needs to be done manually those

240
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:50,930
patches need to be one-by-one selected

241
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,969
you need to click on them you need to

242
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,160
approve them you need to activate it

243
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,870
it's a manual process that takes you a

244
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,899
couple of minutes per batch per note the

245
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,480
thing is if a zippe releases like twenty

246
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:08,629
to thirty of those notes per month and

247
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,350
you have like twenty systems which is

248
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:14,329
quite common then you talk about 400

249
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:19,209
batches that you have to apply manually

250
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:19,209
this is really be a big pain for people

251
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:25,670
so what would really really help here is

252
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:31,129
if that process could be automated to a

253
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:35,810
certain level it's also good to mention

254
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:39,740
that those as ap security notes are they

255
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,300
have a rating like a sieve ESS score so

256
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,699
you don't always have to apply them all

257
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:51,410
you can also only pick the ones that

258
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:52,790
have a really high risk yeah as an

259
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,649
example that's what I want to show

260
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,750
because what we typically see is that

261
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:00,379
customers have like hundreds of those

262
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,899
notes missing even one one of those

263
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:04,939
notes already one of those notes could

264
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:09,709
look do a full compromise of your system

265
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:13,490
I do have a short demo of in this case a

266
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:17,719
privilege escalation via such an SCP

267
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:21,459
security note what we will see in the

268
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,399
demo is that you can get ASAP all rights

269
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:30,500
which is the equivalent of of route

270
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:32,680
online acts and we will do so via sequel

271
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,680
injection

272
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:52,969
hmm it's running yeah what we see here

273
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:56,149
typically is an irregular user which

274
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,910
only has specific rights to test

275
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,399
function modules like API is in SI p

276
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:07,279
system and what we will do here is

277
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:10,790
inject sequel sequel code and this will

278
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,390
give us a reference to the dduk user the

279
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:19,610
Didache user is like the root user in

280
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:23,120
and this can be easily achieved by and

281
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,240
doing an update in the u.s. our user a

282
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,180
first table and by then afterwards you

283
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,180
will see that our user is connected to

284
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,399
the dduk user which means that we take

285
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,800
over the rights from this dduk user

286
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,680
which means we have full control over

287
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,569
the SE p system and by then you can do

288
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,910
anything you can download all the tables

289
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,880
you can create your own users you can do

290
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:50,360
whatever you want and this is this can

291
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,330
be achieved easily by just one missing

292
00:15:50,360 --> 00:16:00,080
su P security nodes where most customers

293
00:15:53,330 --> 00:16:01,720
have tens or hundreds of them missing as

294
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,400
mentioned this is a lot of manual work

295
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,760
this is also stated by the official

296
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,529
documentation of se P itself where they

297
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,170
state well you have to implement every

298
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:15,189
security node manually in every death

299
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:20,180
test and production transport landscape

300
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:26,180
and if you have many deaf systems you

301
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:31,849
need to do it in every def system what

302
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:34,040
we did for a specific customer is we we

303
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:39,200
were asked if there wasn't an easier way

304
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:42,199
to do so as ap itself does not provide

305
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:47,360
an easy way to do so so what we figured

306
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:51,340
out is that we could automate 50 to 75%

307
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,230
of the implementation of these nodes

308
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,260
there are several varieties of those

309
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,870
notes you have really simple notes and

310
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,580
you have also notes that have a

311
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,500
dependency of other notes all the ones

312
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,260
with dependencies we cannot implement

313
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,660
automatically with the single notes we

314
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:13,819
can and because it's a quite

315
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:16,160
straightforward easy process what we did

316
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:19,629
because as if he does not provide any

317
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,240
api's or any function modules or any

318
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:25,699
tools to help you with that so we had to

319
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,450
fall back to a really old mechanism in

320
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:31,730
SP systems to basically do some sort of

321
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,280
macro recording where we record

322
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,770
transactions and then replay them over

323
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,280
and over again with the specific notes

324
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,910
that you want to implement I do have a

325
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,910
demo of that

326
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,100
so to automate that we created an above

327
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,790
program which is the programming

328
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,709
language of si P it's hard to say but it

329
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,230
will probably not not say too much to

330
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,990
you anyway the thing is these are the

331
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,990
screen recordings we captured by first

332
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,760
applying a note recording all the steps

333
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,570
that we did and then replay it

334
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,670
afterwards again for each and every

335
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:14,780
single security note that you want to

336
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:17,900
apply so when we execute that program

337
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:20,389
all you need to provide is a transport

338
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,130
number which is a mechanism of a GP to

339
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,620
move changes throughout your landscape

340
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,050
so all the notes that you apply will be

341
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,659
put in a transport and you need to

342
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,960
provide the list of notes in this case

343
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,090
just nine but we did tests with hundreds

344
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,840
of notes as well and it works it works

345
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,750
really well

346
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,550
it will only run for quite some time but

347
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:45,860
the thing is you can do other work while

348
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:48,500
this process runs in this particular

349
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,889
case it's hard to see with there's out

350
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,850
of the nine I think six are implemented

351
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:57,350
automatically which is 2/3 of the work

352
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,300
that you don't have to do manually and

353
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,980
in this case it's just six nodes which

354
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,960
you can imagine if it's like a couple of

355
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,070
hundreds and you have a lot of systems

356
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,540
that will definitely

357
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:10,550
and this will definitely save you a lot

358
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:12,470
of work yeah the business benefits yeah

359
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,889
it's obvious it saves you a lot of

360
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:20,090
manual and very boring work and how

361
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:22,070
buddy wants to do this believe me yeah

362
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,560
and also what we saw discussed at this

363
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,659
customer is that they raised the

364
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,000
frequency where they applied patches

365
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,580
because it was it was not so so much

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,470
work anymore they could quite easily say

367
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,639
okay instead of once every three months

368
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:39,350
we will do it every month it saves you

369
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,680
time and it's good for compliance here

370
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,679
as well

371
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:48,740
yeah concluding well especially with and

372
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,750
that's also what we see a lot is more

373
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,340
and more customers tend to connect RSVP

374
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:56,420
systems to the internet because they

375
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:59,149
want to you know communicate with a GP

376
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:02,410
using partners vendors they have

377
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:04,640
interfaces to the government for example

378
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,290
employees need to access those systems

379
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,720
from home so they are being internet

380
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:13,430
connected way more than in the past so

381
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,890
risk is getting higher GDP is coming so

382
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,750
it's really up to customers now to start

383
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:22,630
working on the security of the receipe

384
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,630
systems and tooling like this might help

385
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,350
yeah and I said even one single missing

386
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,150
node can lead to a fully compromised

387
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:33,800
system so they really need to step up

388
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:39,470
and yeah the good thing is a lot of this

389
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:41,840
work can be automated that's the that's

390
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,920
the the biggest part of the presentation

391
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,530
I hope it was quite clear although maybe

392
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,370
the tooling itself wasn't that clear yet

393
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:53,480
it's good to mention the tooling itself

394
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,350
it's not

395
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,690
we cannot publish it like open source

396
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:02,870
tooling because it's as ap specific

397
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:06,050
coding however if there are people

398
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:08,959
interested in using the tooling I can

399
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:11,030
quite easily help you setting up

400
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,520
something similar so if there's interest

401
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,930
for the tooling please let me know

402
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,570
afterwards and I'll send you some

403
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,710
documentation that

404
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,960
the thing is we cannot publish

405
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,620
everything online because as a piece not

406
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:27,639
always too happy about it and to make it

407
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:30,459
work you need to do some it's not it's

408
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:32,620
not like SP has its own propriety

409
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,620
protocols and stuff so it can be quite a

410
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,820
pain to set up but if there's people

411
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,370
interested in this stuff I'd be happy to

412
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:44,408
tell you more about it and give you some

413
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:48,070
good pointers and parts of the code yeah

414
00:21:44,409 --> 00:22:00,370
if there's any questions please do let

415
00:21:48,070 --> 00:22:02,918
me know I'm gonna grab the mic thank you

416
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,229
very much have you been in touch with

417
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,879
the ASAP to fix the remaining patches

418
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,879
that are not installed automatically

419
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:21,909
yeah thanks yeah I'm in touch with a GP

420
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,529
all the time about a lot of things I'm

421
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:25,299
not sure if I understand your question

422
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:26,769
specifically because you are talking

423
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:44,980
about patches that are not installed

424
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:49,179
automatically yes yes the the thing is

425
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:52,840
that we can apply the ones that are

426
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:54,070
quite simple the security patches there

427
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,009
are security patches that have

428
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,649
dependencies with other patches and then

429
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:01,990
you can have a whole chain of patches

430
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:03,908
that you need to apply it can start with

431
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,500
one single patch it has a dependency

432
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:08,649
with one that has a dependency with

433
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,500
three others and then it can end up like

434
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:14,199
having to implement 20 or 25 notes

435
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,110
starting with this one single note so

436
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,559
for us at the moment it's not yet

437
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,709
possible to automate that because the

438
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,570
things we can automate are predictable

439
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:28,240
but if you have all these dependencies

440
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,070
for us it's it's hard to predict how

441
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,110
many notes will come out of that so

442
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,500
it's it's just not possible yet the

443
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:38,530
thing is we were hoping that sa P would

444
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,010
come up with dueling as a vendor itself

445
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:44,230
to make this process more easy they

446
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,780
don't they won't I don't know for what

447
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:50,320
reason I guess it has to do with legal

448
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:53,440
stuff because what I see P says is you

449
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,409
have to read thoroughly each and every

450
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,580
single note and if you apply it you have

451
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:03,850
to really click a button where you say

452
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,320
yes I have read this note and it's like

453
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,480
a legal disclaimer that you have read a

454
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,899
note and don't hold a zit be liable

455
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,030
whatever blah blah blah if you automate

456
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,820
that stuff then you're not seeing that

457
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:18,280
anymore so I guess it's a legal thing as

458
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,500
you P itself does not provide any

459
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,050
tooling that they leave customers out

460
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,940
there struggling with this because every

461
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,770
customer I speak with they have the same

462
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:31,330
issue they're not applying these patches

463
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:33,129
because it's just too much work and for

464
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,960
now it's just the simple ones maybe in

465
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:39,100
the future we can also automate the more

466
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,230
complex ones but that's a challenge we

467
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:53,709
have for the future to find a way to do

468
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:55,810
that in that case I think that they say

469
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:59,320
P might be easier to serve is something

470
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:01,330
like an XML schema that they will have

471
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,100
drawn up all the dependencies and they

472
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,470
can update once they add new patches I

473
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:09,010
think that's something even even micro

474
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:12,430
systems as a vendor has so s AP being

475
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:14,620
around for for long enough it's soon it

476
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:17,320
won't come it won't compromise on

477
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,239
anything on their sides giving a map of

478
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,129
dependencies but that's of course big

479
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,580
bold words but just throwing some ideas

480
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,580
there

481
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:36,310
can be mapped but that's a lot of work

482
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:40,630
and and yeah you say well even Microsoft

483
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:43,450
has that yes but you cannot compare

484
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,490
those two all always it's quite hard and

485
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,470
si P does a lot of efforts I must admit

486
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,050
that they do a lot of efforts to improve

487
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,700
things but the hard thing for damage

488
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:56,070
that they have to do it is this

489
00:25:51,700 --> 00:26:00,040
backwards compatibility which goes back

490
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:02,740
20 30 40 years and that's quite hard for

491
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,720
them so but yeah that shouldn't be an

492
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,200
excuse to not do anything that's the

493
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,290
point

494
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,580
and yes dependencies can be met we are

495
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,310
working on something like that

496
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,159
but that's that's still under

497
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:17,280
investigation but thanks for the

498
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,280
feedback

499
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:25,030
anyone else with question I think you

500
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:27,850
are faster than your second need to need

501
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:31,330
to make order thank you for the

502
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:34,449
presentation when you are talking about

503
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:37,210
your customers about the risk but they

504
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,970
are answering you because typically

505
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:43,660
those SP systems the open fully open on

506
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:45,880
the lan to be able to connect so we can

507
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:49,890
imagine and even with one infected pc

508
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:53,980
this could lead to big issue including

509
00:26:49,890 --> 00:27:01,150
trademarks that are sometimes protected

510
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:03,630
in acp systems thanks SP systems they

511
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:07,330
store so many business critical data and

512
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:13,300
it ranges from intellectual property to

513
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:16,060
HR data to vendor data prices or stock

514
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:21,690
relevant information stuff like that

515
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:25,000
it's all energy P systems and yes even

516
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:28,510
ok let me put it differently as a P

517
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,240
systems used to be connected only

518
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,660
internally in the lung for employees

519
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,740
that was the

520
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:40,620
that was the case in the past and what

521
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,890
we also see typically is that the ports

522
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:46,169
to connect to SP systems for example

523
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:48,020
with an SP GUI which is like a big fat

524
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:52,500
client connecting through the server

525
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:56,100
those ports are almost always open from

526
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:59,850
the user Leung to the server on so

527
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:02,129
there's not too much defence there the

528
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:05,159
thing is and I mentioned that earlier to

529
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,900
some other people here as well many big

530
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,420
companies they do have security teams

531
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,010
general security teams with what we see

532
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:14,070
in real life is they look at everything

533
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:16,940
except as ap because SP has their own

534
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:20,189
propriety protocols like the SP GUI

535
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,830
protocol and RFC protocols to

536
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,650
communicate between each other so your

537
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,169
regular pen test team most probably will

538
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,440
not touch an NCP system most of the

539
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,840
times and it's like a separated world

540
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,420
and it's really strange because SP

541
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,959
systems are really business critical but

542
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,550
nobody's watching at it so yeah there's

543
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,430
a lot of work to do and you're right

544
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:48,210
yes often they are really exposed in the

545
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:50,270
network sometimes also from the internet

546
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,790
but a lot of times also from the local

547
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,650
law and if you have a big company where

548
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,960
tens of thousands of people are working

549
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,300
worldwide yet they can often quite

550
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:09,480
easily get access to an SP system in an

551
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:12,870
intended ways yes thank you I was

552
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,240
curious your experience even once you've

553
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,790
put in the patch you go from development

554
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,040
test testing and for production

555
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:22,230
environments or oil and gas specifically

556
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,260
that would from my experience we would

557
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:28,050
do that for a long time before you been

558
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,430
moving to production what is the average

559
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:35,639
lag time you see before they actually

560
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:39,350
implement it on the production side you

561
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,350
have things that's a good question yeah

562
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:49,539
the customers that do patching yeah yeah

563
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:51,369
what's the window of exposure because

564
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:55,379
before something is patched in

565
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:57,789
production it's typically quite long

566
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:59,498
let's make a distinction between I mean

567
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:01,719
there's a lot of customers then don't

568
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:05,139
even apply those patches regularly so

569
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:07,899
they can be vulnerable for months or

570
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:11,319
years the customers that do apply

571
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:14,079
patches what we see there what is quite

572
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:16,029
normal is that as soon as the patches

573
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,519
are released on Patch Tuesday they

574
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:21,309
analyze them the ones with high

575
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,769
vulnerability they apply they put them

576
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:26,859
in a transport they move them to a test

577
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:29,769
environment and what we see often is

578
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:32,559
that it's not really tested explicitly

579
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:34,269
but more tested implicitly so they just

580
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,639
leave it there for let's say two weeks

581
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:38,679
if it doesn't break anything in the test

582
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:41,139
environment they just move it to

583
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:43,509
production so it could take several

584
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:49,689
weeks in that case before it is in

585
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:54,249
production you know anybody else

586
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,619
question so related to that one how

587
00:30:54,249 --> 00:31:00,399
often is that you apply a patch and it

588
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:03,668
breaks something Plus how is it how easy

589
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,589
it is to roll back from that state when

590
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:07,989
you just broke something and okay you

591
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:12,879
quickly need to roll back because it's a

592
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:14,339
critical system there yes another great

593
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:17,649
question

594
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:20,139
and very relevant because you don't want

595
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:25,658
to break stuff in my experience it

596
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:27,849
doesn't happen too often maybe just to

597
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:30,759
give a number maybe one patch out of a

598
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:34,629
thousand will break something so it's

599
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:36,819
really uncommon for that to happen in

600
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:39,428
case it happens and you send it to

601
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:41,019
production and it breaks something what

602
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:43,419
you're not gonna do is restore your

603
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:45,009
whole as ap system because then you go

604
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:47,709
back in time and you lose business

605
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:48,399
transactions and money and that's never

606
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,859
gonna happen

607
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,679
so what you can do in that case is go

608
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:56,679
back to your development system

609
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:59,110
d implement the note there so roll it

610
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,870
back only this specific change in the

611
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,610
code for that specific patch put it in a

612
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,040
transport and move it throughout your

613
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,169
landscape in that case you will fix it

614
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,300
in production you will go back to the

615
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,920
old let's say vulnerable state but at

616
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,520
least your system is working again and

617
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:18,130
then you can find other ways to fix it

618
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:21,100
yeah well what we won last edition what

619
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:23,260
we also sometimes see although it's very

620
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,280
rare but people fixing it directly in

621
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:30,390
production with all kind of crazy code

622
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:34,660
don't do that because that's a no-go

623
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:36,610
putting some oil on the fire so ok if

624
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,210
you're prepared then it's fairly easy to

625
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:42,270
well restore a state where your system

626
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:46,060
still gonna be working properly

627
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:48,610
ok so in that case based on what you

628
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:51,360
said and if you roll out automated just

629
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,679
it's really just like this legal fear or

630
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,429
you don't really have any information on

631
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,140
by sa P is really shying away from doing

632
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,760
this more automated ok apart from

633
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,310
dependencies but the ones that you can

634
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,379
just deploy and it doesn't occur because

635
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,300
even now with with Windows patches okay

636
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,530
we have sometimes problems with it blue

637
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,169
screen of that is really not that

638
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:15,190
company anymore so it's hard to hide

639
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:17,980
behind the plots if something is if

640
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,570
something is broken that how fast it

641
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,070
turns out that it's broken you don't

642
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,530
need to wait for a week so what you

643
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:27,010
explained with the test system that they

644
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:30,850
wait for a week for nothing or two weeks

645
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:32,440
for nothing does it even make sense so

646
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,480
do you need to wait that long because

647
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,520
they are like if you have a business

648
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,380
process that is only tried touching

649
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,530
certain transactions you need to wait

650
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,990
long for for figure out that that one is

651
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:46,060
broken so this does this because in in

652
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,740
most Windows environment they do the

653
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,050
same thing they wait for two weeks or

654
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,810
three weeks and it doesn't make any

655
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:55,590
sense because yeah if it should turn out

656
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:59,740
pretty fast that you have issues there

657
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:03,040
yeah to answer to that there are other

658
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,780
strategies as ap did release on tooling

659
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,739
that you can use

660
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:12,279
to analyze what functionality is hit by

661
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:15,040
a specific security patch if you do use

662
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,350
that you could implement the notes test

663
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,710
those specific functionalities only

664
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:22,750
those and move on to production the

665
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,639
thing is to set something up like that

666
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,530
I'm not sure what the exact name is for

667
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,389
that functionality but they do have

668
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,120
tooling that can see where what

669
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:33,609
functionality is impacted setting that

670
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,139
up also takes a lot of time so I don't

671
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:41,700
see that too much being used in the

672
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:41,699
world ok time for one last question I

673
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,650
think a lot of these security problems

674
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,139
around sapa are connected to the

675
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:52,450
complexity of the total system there's

676
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,759
so many different platforms on s AP

677
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:57,040
applications and so on front end middle

678
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,850
end and back end servers and web facing

679
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,890
services I read a lot of blogs about ACP

680
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,200
security a published by the company ERP

681
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:08,200
scan and they also do a lot like you

682
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,819
like work in in finding s AP

683
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,970
vulnerabilities and writing about them

684
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,610
and honestly it seems to me that every

685
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,770
company that has s AP just need to get

686
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:21,640
fished once and their total totally

687
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:26,560
hacked they are literally wide open for

688
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:28,900
that for a movement and resistance so if

689
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,120
they were Oracle they would claim that

690
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,520
they find and remove most of the

691
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,400
vulnerabilities themselves and that it's

692
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,750
not really a risk to their customers but

693
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,330
they're not Oracle so they have not

694
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:46,780
really claimed this but but how can that

695
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:48,759
just the customers justify the risk of

696
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,740
course they can't live without sa P so

697
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,280
it's a business critical mission mission

698
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:58,169
critical application but shouldn't it be

699
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,170
a way to do that more securely

700
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,010
what what we see is that the companies

701
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:15,400
that do work on patching their systems

702
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:17,560
hardening their SP platform on on you

703
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,900
know mitigating stuff that's that's

704
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,660
really a small group that's not common

705
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,120
but it's it's the group of most big as

706
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:27,970
you be using customers that have money

707
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,250
that have resources but don't forget

708
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,439
there's I mean I don't know the exact

709
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:34,870
numbers but let's say it's maybe 20 80

710
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,140
percent there's another 80 percent of

711
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:40,420
customers that don't really do that

712
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:43,270
stuff those are the ones that are

713
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,020
vulnerable and and yes it is like you

714
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:48,970
described

715
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:52,800
um as a people not say and will not make

716
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:57,819
a statement like like you mentioned and

717
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:00,850
and honestly they do a lot but it's

718
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:03,010
really a shared responsibility the

719
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,230
customers also need to work on this and

720
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,510
as long as they don't pick it up I mean

721
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,190
SP can create patches as you P can make

722
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,140
white papers as if he can do everything

723
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,090
they want if that's not being

724
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:18,129
implemented by customers it's not gonna

725
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:22,660
happen so I think we will see in coming

726
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:25,240
years more as you be related blogs and

727
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:29,259
stuff like this and hopefully not too

728
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:33,220
many public hacks but yeah it's already

729
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:36,180
happening and I think it will need to

730
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:45,160
get worse before it needs to get better

731
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:47,020
yeah yeah yeah well there's not sure I

732
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,700
discussed this before I did some

733
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,280
investigation on the Internet where I

734
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,520
used masks and to just scan the whole

735
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,350
ipv4 range worldwide to see what a zippe

736
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,820
systems are connected and what ports are

737
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:01,779
they're open and what versions are they

738
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:04,570
using and yeah there are so many that

739
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:08,050
like literally thousands of azp systems

740
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:10,390
I mean I didn't even try out the default

741
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:13,300
credentials because it's really really

742
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,650
Annette achill I guess but I think if

743
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,360
you would do something like that and

744
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,540
it's easily

745
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:22,400
crippled you you could you could hack a

746
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:24,600
lot of lot of companies

747
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,640
fortunately we ran out of time

748
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,960
thank you yours for your presentation

749
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,949
give him some clap

750
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,949
[Applause]
