1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:12,949
welcome to the show actually this is not

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,580
a show so the curtains are closing again

3
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:21,290
because I as I see it this talk that

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,209
I've built is about the truth facing

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:27,509
almost every company in existence today

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,990
and the reason it's almost every company

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,969
is because almost every company is a

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,620
small to medium business the big

9
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,250
companies that some of you may work for

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,809
are rare globally seen but we'll get to

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,399
that

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,430
so for SMBs for small to medium

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,520
businesses the realities that they face

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,809
when it comes to security is something

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,149
I've been working with my whole life

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,239
I've been working only for small to

17
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,239
medium companies in the whole career and

18
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,930
they have unique and identical issues

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,190
across all of these small companies and

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:06,299
I believe these issues are very very

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,209
important due to the overweight of SMB

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,299
sloppily and due to the fact that when

23
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,100
you go to conferences or when you read

24
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:17,399
security blogs or you read on Twitter on

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,509
peer list almost nobody cares about this

26
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:22,649
and bees in fact this very talk about

27
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,529
securing SMBs

28
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:27,569
up to a minimum viable level was

29
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:29,369
rejected at ten conferences before it

30
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:32,849
was accepted a few weeks ago at virus

31
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,289
bulletin so few people care about SMB

32
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:39,229
security so I'm very glad to see you're

33
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:39,229
here listening to what it's all about

34
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:44,849
you just already introduced me you can

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,039
find me on pls you can find me on

36
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:49,799
Twitter you can find me active with the

37
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:52,409
cavalry which is a group of volunteers

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,630
working to secure the internet of

39
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,969
connected things in areas that have the

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,469
potential to impact human life so we

41
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,309
work at the intersection between safety

42
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,798
and security

43
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,799
I'm also an intersect librarian which

44
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,359
means basically it's it's another way to

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,000
say that I have no skills at all in

46
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,370
security I can't do anything of what you

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,400
guys can probably do I spend all my time

48
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,670
trying to understand

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,409
a little bit about everything and then

50
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,298
catalog the uses of what other people do

51
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:27,679
put it on the shelf so I know where to

52
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:29,030
find it that's my role in security

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,420
trying to understand what everybody else

54
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,950
is doing

55
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:36,828
and what they have done previously and

56
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:39,439
how it all fits together so Aneesa is

57
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:42,769
one of the few entities globally that

58
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,170
cares about SMB ease recently also NIST

59
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:46,970
and others have put out guidance to us

60
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,970
and B's guidance that I consider

61
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:53,420
horribly lacking in sophistication and

62
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:55,549
comprehensiveness but at least they are

63
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,290
starting to slowly care Anisa has been

64
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:59,480
caring for many many years and has been

65
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,519
putting our guidance for small to medium

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,138
companies to secure themselves for a

67
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,540
long time but as you see from the graph

68
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:12,049
these are the large companies the small

69
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,929
ones are much more prescient actually

70
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,329
this graph is a joke because that's not

71
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,569
how it is at all this is a

72
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:24,379
representation of the distribution of

73
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:28,760
company sizes in the US and all these

74
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:30,948
three added together are SMBs and large

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,379
companies only the tiny tiny fraction

76
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:35,659
down here you have to stack these on top

77
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,638
of each other and compared to that that

78
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,879
is why isn't be security matters that is

79
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,129
why isn't bees need better security than

80
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,429
they have today because today what do

81
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:51,379
they have well I don't have any money

82
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:55,849
for security nothing they don't have any

83
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:59,228
budget but its assigned to security they

84
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:01,638
also don't have the time to do security

85
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:04,699
we're talking about a company of maybe

86
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:07,790
30 maybe 50 maybe 100 maybe 200 people

87
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:11,170
I've seen as a piece of 150 people who

88
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:16,279
had one IT employee

89
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:18,409
horribly horribly busy IT employee how

90
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,459
on earth is someone like that supposed

91
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,960
to do security that's a hard question

92
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,169
that's a really hard question because

93
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,870
the bosses screen might break down the

94
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,030
battery in his mouse might run out and

95
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:39,800
the IT person is the one doing all of

96
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:43,489
these 450 people alone so this is a

97
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:47,630
basic fact of what security is like is

98
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:50,570
in an SMB they also don't have any

99
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,700
skills the few IT employees that they do

100
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,490
have they don't know anything about

101
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,900
security how on earth should they

102
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,200
they're busy

103
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,820
changing batteries in mice updating

104
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,940
maybe if we're lucky that patching

105
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,390
servers maybe they're patching windows

106
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,190
maybe they're patching them Macs

107
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,789
but how'd they know supposed to know how

108
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:18,310
security works it's not reasonable to

109
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,310
expect them to know a lot about security

110
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:27,530
so they'd also don't know much about the

111
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,940
threats that we know exist they may by

112
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,059
now have heard of wanna cry and

113
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:35,270
ransomware they may know that malware

114
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,900
exists as a general topic and that

115
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,010
hackers criminals out there they don't

116
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,130
know that hackers are the good guys

117
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,140
which I hope all of us know they

118
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,840
consider hackers like the media use the

119
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,500
term as a bad thing what you should

120
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,179
never do a plig Ettore reminder hackers

121
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,640
are the immune system of the internet

122
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,740
trying to keep us all safe and the other

123
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,780
guys we call them cyber criminals such

124
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,930
as criminals right so they don't know

125
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,308
that the threats are out there

126
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,309
[Music]

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:17,020
they don't know that firewall rules need

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:21,009
to be deny any any and then allow what

129
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,830
you need they don't know that a switch

130
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:27,520
can have ACLs maybe they do maybe they

131
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:30,639
have some knowledge of switches they

132
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,549
don't know that on a firewall if it's a

133
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,780
next-generation firewall you can turn on

134
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,710
different things to improve they just

135
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:42,520
don't know all the things you have spend

136
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,710
your time reading about turning on the

137
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,389
Windows Firewall so that you don't you

138
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,849
can't connect from workstation to

139
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,740
workstation for lateral movement things

140
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:52,900
to prevent ransomware from working they

141
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,250
have no idea about anything nothing of

142
00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:01,659
this they don't they just don't know as

143
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:05,050
well they have someone who founded the

144
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:06,938
company or has been running the company

145
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,289
or has just been hired to run the

146
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:14,949
company who come from no matter where it

147
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:17,259
could be anything it can be a former

148
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,270
librarian who starts her own company and

149
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:22,089
she doesn't know about security

150
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:25,210
management in SMPS are not like these

151
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:27,279
big MBA people who lead the big

152
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,150
companies they come from any background

153
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,909
they have no knowledge about security no

154
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,089
formal education from a big school that

155
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:40,270
at least includes basics of IT and

156
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:43,529
security so how are they supposed to

157
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:46,419
know that they should be allocating

158
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:49,120
funding for security hiring at least

159
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,549
maybe one person to start doing

160
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,330
something they can't it's impossible

161
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,330
they just don't know

162
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,380
should they following not picture become

163
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:04,609
interested in doing something about

164
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:07,520
security they can't find what they

165
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,560
should be doing they may find reading

166
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,490
and tech target or dark reading about

167
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,190
seven common threats that face SM B's

168
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:20,120
but it's it's not actionable

169
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:24,080
it's not precisely targeted at what they

170
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,760
can be doing and should be doing with

171
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,450
the skills the people the time and the

172
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:34,370
money that they don't have it's really

173
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:39,380
hard for them to find out what to do if

174
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:44,660
they even care about searching for it so

175
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:47,330
we in a situation overall where SMBs may

176
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,040
now and then careful about security for

177
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,710
a few weeks when the mainstream media

178
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,640
cover something like not Pecha and then

179
00:08:51,710 --> 00:09:00,590
it just dies out again and that is

180
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:02,510
reality working in SMB oh and feel free

181
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,960
to jump in if you have questions if you

182
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:09,500
have comments or anything because I'll

183
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,750
just keep rambling on if you don't so

184
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:18,350
just summarizing what we went through so

185
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:21,530
far this is the reality for maybe 99% of

186
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:24,230
all companies out there I do consulting

187
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,880
for some of these companies to try to

188
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:30,470
help them get started on the road of

189
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:33,110
security and it's it's so rewarding to

190
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,870
see what happens if you just sit down

191
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,100
with the IT people and some I may be a

192
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,610
manager for an SMB

193
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,440
for four hours and just talk it's so

194
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,440
rewarding to see what happens in half a

195
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:50,990
year after that if you make them aware

196
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:53,620
of the threats the easy good ways you

197
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:58,420
can start countering and building a

198
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,420
hardened better infrastructure

199
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:11,020
so they may have an anti-virus in an SMB

200
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,589
that's the only thing that you can be

201
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:17,410
reasonably sure that they might have

202
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:20,350
which is why last night at this biggest

203
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,520
their house having or yesterday it had

204
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,500
Lewis having discussion with people

205
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:29,650
about antivirus I don't know how many of

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:33,400
you know this but antivirus s a concept

207
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:36,490
is fundamentally broken it cannot secure

208
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,209
anything plus it increases your attack

209
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,820
surface you can actually be hacked by

210
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,650
advanced actors just by having antivirus

211
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,900
because most of them are very easily

212
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,750
hacked and they all have a shim into

213
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,270
your files so when you receive a file if

214
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,460
it has an expert for your AV your hacked

215
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,699
it's kind of that easy once you know

216
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:03,160
what you're doing that's an attacker but

217
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:05,890
still even if they cannot catch malware

218
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,939
even if you can be hacked by having it I

219
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:14,110
still believe in having AV because it's

220
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,840
the only thing that SMB is having and we

221
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:25,240
need AV to be more efficient and secure

222
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:27,220
all right so so far it's looking a

223
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,980
little bit bleak as amis don't have a

224
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,920
lot going for them right but it's not

225
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,410
hopeless because I've I've been in the

226
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,380
situation my previous job I was working

227
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:42,939
as CIO for a bank and in charge of the

228
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:45,900
security also has C so and it's it is

229
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,900
hopeless but

230
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:56,890
it's also not and the reason it's not is

231
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,230
exactly the thing I've experienced in my

232
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,330
previous job and in my consulting in

233
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,959
Luxembourg for smaller companies you

234
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:07,899
need to just reach one one person and

235
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,849
make them care and know a little bit

236
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:12,610
about the threats and what you can start

237
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,300
doing and they can really really start

238
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:23,140
making substantial changes over time

239
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:28,620
following that so to secure some B's we

240
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,620
need not to fix the time the money

241
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,220
the people we just need that one

242
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,620
individual to become aware of the

243
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,160
threats and of ways to start countering

244
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:44,540
them and that is the challenge getting

245
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:47,930
one person in every SMB to do this to

246
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:53,959
reach them to make them aware that is

247
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:55,579
also a very hard question so in the

248
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:01,339
years that I worked in my previous job

249
00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:03,258
for the bank we did a lot of work on

250
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:08,720
security because when I started in my

251
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:11,899
job the end it is a real bank actually

252
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,379
but it had no security it had nothing

253
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:17,029
this is like seven eight years ago it

254
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:20,269
had nothing when I started the firewall

255
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:23,029
was allow any any a few ACLs on a switch

256
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:24,199
behind that the last server had been

257
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:26,379
patched three and a half years

258
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:30,620
previously workstations mostly the same

259
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:35,290
everything was shut to pieces everything

260
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:39,170
was just horrible and we had no way of

261
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:45,019
knowing if the whole thing was hacked

262
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:48,969
beyond any chance of ever recovering the

263
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:54,889
hardware so the first thing I did was I

264
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:57,999
hired a team of IT to people rather

265
00:13:54,889 --> 00:14:03,649
quickly and laid on a few more and then

266
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:07,129
we started working and in the time I was

267
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:10,339
there I got budget once for something

268
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:12,649
and that was to replace all the hardware

269
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,029
every single piece of hardware in the

270
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,679
whole Bank was replaced because the

271
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:17,899
servers were eight years old they were

272
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,529
we had another server die like every two

273
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:23,029
weeks the workstations also in the

274
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:25,279
morning just wouldn't turn on because

275
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,439
power supplies were dead or memory or

276
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,230
that everything was dying everything was

277
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:31,998
the company had inherited it from its

278
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,980
mother company in Sweden and the

279
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:36,139
hardware was so old and it was just it

280
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,050
just couldn't do any more so I got

281
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,720
budget once

282
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,099
in my whole time there and that was to

283
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,579
replace every single piece of hardware

284
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:52,509
which we did over a period of one year

285
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:56,049
while building hotend OSS and putting in

286
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:57,910
place a new hardware in succession in

287
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:59,499
the hopes that then we start with a

288
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,600
clean infrastructure that we can

289
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:05,769
reasonably assume it's not totally

290
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:10,059
hacked so that's what we did and that

291
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:13,749
was only the beginning over the course

292
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:17,670
of three four five years we implemented

293
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:21,179
a lot of security mitigations and

294
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:26,889
basically none of them required budgets

295
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:32,290
skills time they were all something you

296
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:35,339
can do on an SMP six IT staff skill

297
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:41,110
level reasonably quick

298
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:45,249
they were doable realistic for some B's

299
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:49,779
to do so it took everything that we did

300
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:51,309
and I I put it into a framework I called

301
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:54,149
Minimum Viable security which I

302
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:56,740
published online it has every single

303
00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:00,399
control that we did we implemented over

304
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,319
those years and I know I know that SMBs

305
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,889
can do these because I've done them with

306
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:07,779
my team and together we knew maybe

307
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:10,389
something about IT but very little about

308
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,069
security at least initially and that of

309
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:14,949
course grows while you're working with

310
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:17,559
it while you're implementing but this is

311
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:20,109
doable everything in NBS is something

312
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:23,199
that an SMP can do if only one person in

313
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,600
the company cares about starting so what

314
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,279
I need you to do is if you know anyone

315
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,779
working in SMB so if you work in s and

316
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,389
B's give you the medicine

317
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:33,639
give them VM the minimum viable security

318
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,470
framework give it to them because if you

319
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,569
only you give it to them and you tell

320
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,579
them why they should care and that they

321
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:42,349
can do this it could make a big

322
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:45,149
difference for their company

323
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,040
you can find it there the slides will

324
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:50,010
also I hope beyond the b-side lockberg

325
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:58,920
website if not you can find this on that

326
00:16:50,010 --> 00:17:02,459
link on P list so this is the basics of

327
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,889
the talk that I did and I met a person

328
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:07,079
in in Las Vegas this summer for hacker

329
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:11,280
summer camp at business San Francisco

330
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:13,980
area name is Russell he's and co-author

331
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,379
of a new paper that took the work I did

332
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:23,099
with NBS and they built upon it they

333
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:26,130
made it more they in the paper they say

334
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:28,860
some very good and true things that as

335
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:33,350
soon as you have an SMB that starts to

336
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:37,439
build skills and security and to care

337
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:40,770
then you can really actually do very

338
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,640
very good security not just Minimum

339
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:47,940
Viable you can do actual security that

340
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,990
gives you a very good chance of not

341
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:55,380
getting bridged ever the reasons you can

342
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:57,300
do that all that for an SMB all the

343
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,250
things that slow the big companies down

344
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,059
that make them unable to patch unable to

345
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,610
make decisions

346
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:05,220
unable to be flexible all these reasons

347
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,800
do not exist for an SMB in an SMB you

348
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,450
can very easily complete your entire

349
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,149
asset management database and keep it up

350
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,340
to date you can make decisions very

351
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:18,650
quickly

352
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:21,990
you can adapt you know your environment

353
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,910
you know your networks you know what you

354
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,440
have where you can baseline your

355
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,750
infrastructure you can baseline your

356
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,630
network devices you can baseline your

357
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,690
operating systems you can baseline your

358
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,950
web server logs your database logs

359
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:38,570
everything is doable because it's so

360
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,909
small and this is a both

361
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:43,580
it's both a strategic and a tactical

362
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:48,799
advantage for SMBs as compared to others

363
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:50,299
an SMB let's say hunt people with two

364
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,759
people working in security and maybe

365
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:55,610
another two or three and IT can do

366
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:58,730
better security then the largest bank

367
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,990
you've ever heard of or Deloitte I hope

368
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,340
not here no one here is from Deloitte

369
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:07,669
but apparently anyone can do better

370
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:11,539
security than them so this is the

371
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:14,000
important thing for us in bees we have

372
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:17,120
them all at a point where they have

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,820
nothing but we can get them up to a

374
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,549
minimum level a minimum viable level of

375
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:26,360
security and once it's there they can

376
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:30,940
actually progress to as good as it

377
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:34,070
almost gets in security and all it takes

378
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,279
is reaching one person in that company

379
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:41,720
and convincing them to care and giving

380
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:43,490
them the framework mvs and letting them

381
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,389
know that you can do this everything

382
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:50,330
here can be done and I believe that can

383
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:53,979
make a difference if only somehow we can

384
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:57,340
give them and make them aware of this

385
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,340
all right

386
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,430
that's every single word I have to say I

387
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:19,540
think that might have been even close to

388
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:20,890
the 20 minutes questions please all

389
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,010
right thank you

390
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,840
1 Maurice you have noticed around us in

391
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,500
bees because they used my first toe back

392
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,750
said it was one he's not whatever chose

393
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,450
to go for either open the source or

394
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:37,270
closed platform they will always have to

395
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,940
pay for it so open the source because

396
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,070
that was commented before handsome

397
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,290
becomes misconception that it's T or

398
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,200
free no it's not because you need to

399
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,550
specialize people to deal with this and

400
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,790
again someone will have to be on the

401
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,889
road I do maintain it now if you get a

402
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,659
closer solution I can you have to pay a

403
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,400
lot of money and possibly also run

404
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,850
around maintenance after a few years

405
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,940
anyways because you have as much support

406
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,379
when you first buy the product so after

407
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,990
awareness I believe that's the next

408
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,570
problem because they usually go for free

409
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:13,900
solutions and that they tried to

410
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:17,230
integrate together with slopey patchwork

411
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,640
and it doesn't quite work and so at the

412
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,030
end they have bigger problem than they

413
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,970
originally started to solve again

414
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,530
talking on the with a background of a

415
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,720
company that was running on five people

416
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,129
one being the CEO and the other one the

417
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,460
secretary you can imagine how that was

418
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,460
running

419
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:40,369
you have to make choices and your

420
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:43,309
choices will stick with you and

421
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:46,789
sometimes haunt you but even if you

422
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:49,039
choose an open-source framework you can

423
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:51,559
still leverage advantages from it yes

424
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,319
there will be work maintaining it but

425
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,918
for an SMB it's it's doable it's not

426
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,099
that bad

427
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,159
you can also whatever tool it is that

428
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:04,369
you're looking into if you need software

429
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,649
you can usually get commercial tools

430
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:08,178
rather cheap when you're an SMB because

431
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:10,518
you can negotiate with most of the tool

432
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:13,069
vendors and for every tool they

433
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:15,259
sometimes have a free tier which is

434
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:18,259
often sufficient for your needs like

435
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:21,859
Splunk you may not have more logs than

436
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:23,809
you need to stay within the free tier or

437
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:27,319
you can just go with grey log the open

438
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:29,779
source alternative there well the Alex

439
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,119
stack but you have to make choices and

440
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:33,379
you will suffer the consequences of your

441
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,369
choices because no choice is ever

442
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:36,369
perfect that's true

443
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,520
so thanks because it's I think it's a

444
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,950
really important problem was discussing

445
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,570
with some friends also about this and

446
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,530
one of the issue I think is also the

447
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,570
especially for the small medium

448
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,100
companies is the retention of the people

449
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,530
because there is already okay we hear

450
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,480
about the lack of talent and the thing

451
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,910
is that we are less than I mean the

452
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,160
demand is very high and we're fewer so

453
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,410
it's for a small smaller companies more

454
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,090
difficult to keep with people because

455
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,010
like okay if you are like two people

456
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,810
show how do you keep those people do you

457
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,100
have like any advice especially given

458
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,370
your experience with like small

459
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,830
companies who will do advice to keep how

460
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,629
to do retention for people in the

461
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:33,360
smaller like small environment like

462
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:39,060
those in all the smbs that I have worked

463
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:41,129
with or for the employee retention has

464
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:44,399
always been very high because the people

465
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:47,280
in charge have been very responsible and

466
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,670
relatively sane people I've seen of

467
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,670
course people in SMPS where people you

468
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:55,560
they leave a lot but I think for an SMB

469
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,390
with a good mission a good product and

470
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,129
rather good management employee

471
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:02,220
retention usually tends to be very very

472
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,740
high I mean in places I work people

473
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:10,800
stayed there for 15 years

474
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:14,670
easy Oh some pieces often don't have

475
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:17,600
security people so first you need to

476
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:20,970
actually hire someone to do security

477
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,149
well how to keep them pay them well

478
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,430
because they will have to be medicines

479
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,800
of every tray jack-of-all-trades

480
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,360
so you need to pay them well if you pay

481
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,960
your security person less and you pay

482
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,820
your IT admins they're gonna leave and

483
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,410
this is what we see right now that ITR

484
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,689
the kings of the castle and get higher

485
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,920
salaries and security people and it's

486
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,450
just not gonna last

487
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,450
yeah you have to pay them all

488
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,660
so if you have to pay them more then

489
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,090
that money has to come from somewhere

490
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,640
and you have to convince them that this

491
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,000
is actually a good idea that's gonna be

492
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,570
hard

493
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,820
the other hand maybe not but on the

494
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,939
other hand one of the problems that I

495
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:13,570
still think that we are in is that

496
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,940
security is too hard and we need to make

497
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,760
this we make me we need to make this

498
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,290
easier you you briefly mentioned one of

499
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,270
your remarks during the presentation was

500
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:26,710
need to set you a firewall to deny

501
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:29,200
everything that that comes with a lot of

502
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,540
work because then yes it does because

503
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,910
then all of a sudden all of your

504
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,430
customers all of your employees need to

505
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:39,310
come to you and ask you for to put in

506
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:42,520
new rules in the firewall you need to

507
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:46,629
manage the firewall and then that comes

508
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,400
with a lot of management cost on the

509
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,340
specific example of the firewall for an

510
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,770
SMP analyzing the rules in the segments

511
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:59,679
you have and putting it in place in less

512
00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:01,210
than a week's work yeah and then you

513
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,330
don't need to basically ever change it

514
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,330
again

515
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:31,039
if our roles are not going to be an

516
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:35,600
obstacle both are valid points now

517
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:37,580
that's why I go in between usually and I

518
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,870
come from a nice oh by the way for the

519
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,710
runners I don't know me

520
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:44,539
usually we advise larger enterprises and

521
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,990
why I will make that remark now you'll

522
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:51,970
understand we advise them to separate IT

523
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:55,039
from IT security but in the case of SMEs

524
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:57,740
for start the minimum measure they

525
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:01,158
should do is to at least make the

526
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,620
security lifecycle part of ID if they

527
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:07,220
don't have money so then they satisfy

528
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:11,209
both positions if you can afford to have

529
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:13,010
it separate even the better I mean I was

530
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,889
working for a large enterprise and for

531
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,100
the first six months of my 3-year

532
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:21,500
employment I was doing firewall

533
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:25,309
configuration management with which is

534
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,929
security but it was more like change

535
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:29,110
that rule change that rule that was

536
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:34,039
feeling more like ID that was not

537
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:43,809
instant response or something that's my

538
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:43,809
opinion anyways they never change

539
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,220
they nearly never ever change so a week

540
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:53,440
of analyzing what traffic needs to go

541
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,950
where from where and you fine you're

542
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,289
fine

543
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,359
it's work that's doable it can it can be

544
00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:00,129
done it can be completed and you'll be

545
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:01,779
very much better off after having done

546
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:04,238
it and it's the same for so many other

547
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:07,989
areas everything I put into MBS is

548
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:10,470
doable and it's not an obstruction to

549
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:10,470
the company

550
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,180
you have to put too many obstacles

551
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,010
because then the business starts to

552
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,820
complain and invade this okay now what

553
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,890
the hell security is that we should

554
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,990
start also to talk more with the

555
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,270
business we should understand I mean if

556
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,850
what you are protective because of

557
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,770
course we we all like want to do top

558
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,010
security we want to lock everything

559
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,780
everything has to be super secured but

560
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,760
sometimes what all those measures are

561
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,830
more than what you're protecting

562
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,660
sometimes if you lock too much the

563
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,790
business I mean we all we need to

564
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,410
understand more the trade off we need to

565
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,590
undercut more to a business understand

566
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:58,410
their needs and some risk has to be

567
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:01,110
taken something cannot be fully secured

568
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,910
or fully like locked because then it's

569
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,050
blocking the business so we need to make

570
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,880
compromises and we need to understand

571
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,980
this morning and this is an issue I

572
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,870
started to understand this in the last

573
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,850
years I have to admit that right until

574
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,159
few years ago was right now this is to

575
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,629
be super secure super locked and it just

576
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,880
doesn't work then they don't listen to

577
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,400
us and they say you know what security

578
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,550
is not enabling the business is blocking

579
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,070
it so we I think we also on our side

580
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:28,290
need to to understand this and talk to

581
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:30,419
the business and really make like the

582
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,970
requirements like what are your top

583
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,500
requirements from a city from like

584
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:38,040
usability from like availability point

585
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,110
of view and then we we run our security

586
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,270
program and our secure according to this

587
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:45,500
because this is something we really I

588
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,500
think we are still failing

589
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:59,440
yeah so I totally agree with the one

590
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:03,249
person analogy the the local hero is

591
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,659
entirely true what thing if you could

592
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:07,489
recommendation to put into the system

593
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:09,489
for lack of a better word would be

594
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:13,070
actual specific recommendations as to

595
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:15,379
the tools for vulnerability assessment

596
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,820
these are good options for patch

597
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:18,259
management these are good options

598
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,168
because a lot of times they don't have

599
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:23,330
time to research or understand which

600
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:25,279
tools I know we sometimes are reluctant

601
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,168
to name specific vendors or if things

602
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,509
may change in the future but without

603
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:33,099
giving them a place to go or an example

604
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:33,099
it often leads to newer

605
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,750
perfect

606
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:50,200
in or Western European countries where

607
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:53,460
we know that the economy is mainly done

608
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,150
by SMB what are you thinking about

609
00:30:53,460 --> 00:31:00,280
responsibility of or government

610
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:02,890
shouldn't the initiative to help SMB get

611
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:06,250
access to those high skilled security

612
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:13,000
people and help them initiating this

613
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:14,170
security initiative inside SMB that

614
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,960
would be a really really good thing if

615
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,840
governments would provide assistance

616
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,400
with qualified consultants to just go

617
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,959
out and sit down with them for a few

618
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,970
hours and explain to them what to do and

619
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,550
give them a framework like this that

620
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:30,490
would be hugely impactful or if Anissa

621
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:33,520
did it if he needs I actually proposed

622
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,960
to them a few years ago that they they

623
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,120
start an initiative where they visit

624
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,860
every single SMB but of course it's

625
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,030
beyond the resources but I just don't

626
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,030
believe it's a really good idea

627
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:50,589
so the recommendation of the tools

628
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:52,119
reminded me of the initiatives that

629
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:54,489
they've done in the Netherlands on

630
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,129
privacy because in privacy they usually

631
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:58,749
say these tools of shits you shouldn't

632
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:01,449
use Facebook that you shouldn't use

633
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:03,639
what's happened whatever so instead of

634
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,649
doing that they said these are the tools

635
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:07,839
that you can use and they respect your

636
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:11,439
privacy and they do this and it is and

637
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,879
these are the advantages itself and the

638
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,829
whole idea of that is that there is a

639
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:16,329
community behind this and it maintains

640
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:19,178
it so are you going to build the

641
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:21,379
community around these recommendations

642
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:23,440
so you can update them

643
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,440
you

644
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:51,250
just to few remarks about the problem to

645
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:52,900
keep the security inside the SMB has

646
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,630
seen the problem is earlier they don't

647
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,880
have the high D to our as you said they

648
00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:00,340
don't have to hide the ID to have a

649
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,910
security company in 30 girls inside the

650
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,490
company

651
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:07,210
I remember I was investigating runs on

652
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:09,610
one case and I take Mecca complain the

653
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,740
French law enforcement I'm a member of

654
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,469
the French law enforcement and I was

655
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:17,500
investing a run for my case in an SMB

656
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:19,900
and they like to complain in a small

657
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,940
local police and the case arrived in my

658
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,700
unit and we call the company in low to

659
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,280
have the server or encourage the server

660
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,100
as they refused to give the server is

661
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,389
that because it is secret information

662
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,120
it's because the server which is

663
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:37,150
encrypted is seduced by the company

664
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,520
since two months why because some server

665
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,920
it's working it's useful for them to get

666
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,500
into to go into the internet even it's

667
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,530
encrypted it's not all our cryptid as I

668
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:51,040
just keep it because they want to work

669
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:53,680
so they don't have IT guy inside the

670
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,050
company they just the guy we just

671
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,670
installed a server at the beginning of

672
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,730
the company they don't trust him anymore

673
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,950
and the server was encrypted and say

674
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:05,020
just now we don't want to give you the

675
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,630
server because we need to do the daily

676
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,449
business this is a level of awareness we

677
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,919
are in reconvene at the other hand the

678
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,439
visit because you talk about government

679
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:17,969
in France since many year we have an

680
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,440
agency's an FCC which is dedicated to

681
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:22,659
improve security in critical

682
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:28,750
infrastructure because as you say big

683
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:31,178
company are very well a combined in the

684
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,010
security but yes it was a problem for

685
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:35,620
the SMB so the French government

686
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:38,850
launched a new initiative its website a

687
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:41,980
dedicated against cyber malevolence so

688
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:45,069
small company individual catchers report

689
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,620
that's the other problem and the website

690
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:49,929
links them to computer specialists in

691
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,120
order to try to solve the problem and

692
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,429
the deal with the computer specialist

693
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,880
they need to follow rules guidance in

694
00:34:54,429 --> 00:35:01,200
order to report to this

695
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:06,870
entities the problem the company have so

696
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:13,799
into start use of observe is not a cause

697
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:15,930
but easy to private companies yeah at

698
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,130
the end because the company the privates

699
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:22,100
assume computer specialist on a train

700
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,870
but it's a way to put a link between

701
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,310
because honestly if you remember what I

702
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,319
just told about the company will just

703
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:31,410
keep to server encrypted and work with

704
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:39,060
with the flow in it it's yeah we need to

705
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:41,279
do something instead what I think we can

706
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,259
teach if we can if we could just somehow

707
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,930
get the message to every SMB what we can

708
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,650
teach them to do is to compare a hash or

709
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:51,690
file itself with virustotal

710
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:56,360
we can teach them to send it to malware

711
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,360
comm that's doable it's free

712
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:15,110
both what point of view are valid but

713
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,609
the problem I'm French as well and if

714
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,730
you look at what the French government

715
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:23,740
did is to pass a law called the military

716
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:25,940
program law it was in 2014 I guess and

717
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,189
several other countries about the world

718
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,490
are doing the same I don't have the list

719
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:35,030
out of my top of my head but basically

720
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:40,549
they defined vital importance operators

721
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:43,040
and this this movement is towards the

722
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,110
major infrastructure providers in six or

723
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,750
seven major domains infrastructure

724
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:53,330
energy transport finance and so on and

725
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:56,390
in many countries and the French NSA

726
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,180
site that's the same it's mostly ironed

727
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:01,640
towards big businesses not assemblies

728
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:05,060
and this initiative is good but the

729
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,700
program is that how do you communicate

730
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,860
to the businesses to the assemblies the

731
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,919
existence of such initiative and how do

732
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:17,300
you accompany them from for example a

733
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,400
month ago there was a report that the

734
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,900
small business with eight employees it's

735
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,600
somewhere in South of France

736
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:27,200
they simply shut down because they got

737
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:33,799
attacked by ransomware and the backups

738
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:36,830
got screwed as well so the CEO he is 60

739
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:41,840
years old he is retiring but leaving

740
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:44,750
eight employees on the ground and if he

741
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:47,810
thought he had some appropriate metal

742
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:50,380
protection level basic one but lack of

743
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:53,950
information lack of knowledge lack of

744
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:57,400
support so

745
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:58,990
I like what the NSSE does I support it I

746
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,720
work for big business at the moment and

747
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:08,109
I'm not satisfied about how it works but

748
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:11,319
the problem with putting the bring the

749
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:15,390
awareness to the assemblies this is a

750
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,390
major issue in my opinion

751
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,009
you

752
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,200
you

753
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:39,400
you

754
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,710
I came from Germany from the Stuttgart

755
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,560
area and apart from the big car makers

756
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:52,460
there are also many many highly

757
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:56,960
innovative SMBs doing machinery and

758
00:38:52,460 --> 00:39:00,820
stuff and family owned 5060 hundred

759
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:05,230
people and they don't care a bit about

760
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:10,370
security not not least not least bit

761
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:16,640
last year there was a action made by the

762
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:18,950
I HKD Hughart it's the Assembly of all

763
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,379
companies of all small media and medium

764
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:29,569
business medium-sized companies and they

765
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:32,690
made a HTTP or tls/ssl check on all

766
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:38,630
Member websites and mail servers and

767
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:43,370
stuff and I saw when what what they did

768
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:46,550
what IH k was offering and many

769
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:48,319
companies did opt out they said we don't

770
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:52,760
need as we are we know we are good

771
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:57,110
already and much more companies that

772
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:59,570
ignored is completely and if you if you

773
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:03,350
search for it you can find the results

774
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:05,390
on the i h ke website it's a Germany

775
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:11,600
unfortunately the results were

776
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:14,270
devastating and I bet if you make the

777
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,540
same test nowadays it would be exactly

778
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,540
the same

779
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:29,499
yeah editor maybe if I may have so on

780
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,959
the topic of the government trying to do

781
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:34,178
their best weld SMB so I just created my

782
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:36,698
own company working as freelance one

783
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:39,579
year ago and the issue is today we have

784
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:41,949
plenty of a site where we can go when

785
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:43,959
there is an issue so if we have a

786
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:46,719
problem yeah we can find information but

787
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:48,939
when you create your company no one is

788
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,799
telling you anything for me it's good

789
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:53,469
because ok I'm working in the field I

790
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:55,689
know what to do but ok let's say you

791
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:57,670
create your SMV you have toward to go to

792
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:59,379
the notary to do all this

793
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,449
dang stuff for that you have plenty of

794
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,239
information you go to registry of

795
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:06,549
Commerce yeah you get the full stuff all

796
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,769
the details what you need to do get a

797
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:11,199
bank account to do the invoicing the VAT

798
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:13,959
very important the VAT but nothing about

799
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:16,689
security and that's that's the issue

800
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:19,149
because if you do not do this at the

801
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:20,618
start then obviously the problem will

802
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,539
come and then you can use your website

803
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:26,259
saying this is what you should do and

804
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:28,539
you have an issue sulit and in few cases

805
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:31,900
yeah that's really too late because then

806
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:34,630
the company must shut down so my point

807
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:39,489
is we should have initiative a lot

808
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:41,469
earlier and the states should get budget

809
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:46,390
to create team professionals that are

810
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:48,519
well paid that can advise the SMB which

811
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:51,328
is not the case for the moment so this

812
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:51,328
will go on and on

813
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,880
you

814
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,549
exactly security by design and privacy

815
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,649
by default by design should be both of

816
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:21,569
them may be both taught already in

817
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:22,979
primary school in universities at Camp

818
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:24,569
of Commerce when you start your company

819
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:26,999
you should receive information about

820
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:28,739
this it should be all over you should be

821
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:30,779
bombarded with why you should do this

822
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,209
and the consequences of not doing it

823
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:34,709
because as we just heard and there's a

824
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:36,808
bee can go out of business in just one

825
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:38,999
ransomware attack and this is not the

826
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:41,219
only example of this yes'm bees really

827
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:43,948
really do get impacted very hard when

828
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:53,549
they get breached or attacked oh thanks

829
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:57,869
man it hurts because of that we have to

830
00:42:53,549 --> 00:43:00,150
go for coffee break alright

831
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:06,659
we started by the wrong assumption that

832
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:09,419
the same bees have ID it might be as it

833
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:11,549
was mentioned that the majority of cases

834
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:14,538
actually might be that they just bought

835
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:17,880
three computers they have the default

836
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:20,729
administrative privileges they bought a

837
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,799
server space and a namespace and that's

838
00:43:20,729 --> 00:43:25,979
it

839
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:28,409
so what we said before might be wholly

840
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:31,078
invalid oh yeah hire an IT security

841
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:34,679
person why do I need any security if I

842
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:38,059
don't even have IIT that will take a lot

843
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:40,949
of convincing it's more than awareness

844
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:45,119
it needs to be shaped from the ground at

845
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:50,309
state level maybe we have to promote I

846
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:52,409
believe cyber hygiene the same way they

847
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:55,589
do hygiene in their offices or wherever

848
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:56,969
they're based you clean your kitchen and

849
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:59,509
your toilet where you don't clean your

850
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,509
computer

851
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:10,210
either a security champion or out stow

852
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:13,270
out source like lately I have seen many

853
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:14,800
companies sell services recurring

854
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,990
services once every six months to

855
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,780
smaller companies and they go into visit

856
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:21,040
and they do cease alike service and

857
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,320
advisory for breaches and all that

858
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,150
something like that but these will be

859
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,980
promoted by state level I believe as a

860
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,730
service because simply there are not

861
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:32,079
enough people to serve the community

862
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:34,589
awareness can do as much but we need

863
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,589
hands on

864
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,779
you

865
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,720
I tend to disagree with what you said

866
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:23,230
about IG now there is every company

867
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:26,620
every business has got IT it may not be

868
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:28,450
a complicated a complex one even if if

869
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,700
these cloud services or closed

870
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:34,930
cloud-based services like Google Apps

871
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:40,839
and and so on it is IT today you have no

872
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:47,470
no business without a single computer ok

873
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:49,330
my button ok so I see that this is a

874
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,149
very interesting topic unfortunately we

875
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:53,650
have now to wrap up so because it's time

876
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,080
for coffee right can we must go on with

877
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,140
the day so thank you very much closed

878
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:03,689
