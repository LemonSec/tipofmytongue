1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,200
hello so hello yeah

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,860
so today we're talking about Oh mature

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:18,090
is your HTTP implementation most of you

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:22,380
have probably heard about HTTP are using

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:27,780
it but maybe you don't know all the the

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:34,379
tips you can so first questions why to

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:37,860
use HTTP and wait to use this HTTP is

8
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:42,410
ever allowing you to improve the

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,410
security and privacy your website's

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:57,059
quite strange problem with the micro but

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:59,700
will continue if you are using Firefox

12
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,430
you could see that in the last versions

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,890
the implement new a pop-up that will

14
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,499
display you a warning message if you

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,179
enter your credentials on an HTTP web

16
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:14,958
sites if you're doing some business and

17
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:18,420
you want to have good ranking in Google

18
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:21,929
HTTP will help you also to improve your

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,560
ranking and moreover it will be part of

20
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:29,840
a community that will make the the

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,840
Internet's safe words by using HTTPS

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:38,369
what are the main risk to use HTTP only

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,369
problems of confidentiality people some

24
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:45,240
bad guy called sniff your login and

25
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:48,869
password shows but also the data that

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,499
are transported over the network program

27
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:56,539
about Tegrity manipulations about the

28
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:56,539
data transfers about the network

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,970
we plan some game so there's some

30
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,840
interactive slide with the questions and

31
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:08,090
the first person that will answer will

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,630
give the good answers we bring some

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:20,960
gifts deciding questions are pins so if

34
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:25,010
you see the pins pay attention so talk

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,950
about the HTTP threads the typical one

36
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,829
passive spoofing if it's roping on with

37
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,829
the rogue access points passes poofing

38
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:38,030
on networking telecom equipments expand

39
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:41,000
sport man-in-the-middle attack our

40
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:47,650
people zoning we have equivalent for

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,950
ipv6 something quite innovative this

42
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,380
small device was a Raspberry Pi zero

43
00:02:50,950 --> 00:03:02,600
with poison tab software's you plug it

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:07,340
on your computer victims and USB it will

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:10,910
emulate an Internet device over USB it's

46
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,820
running a DHCP and DNS traffic and you

47
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:17,000
will first do these websites to connect

48
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:21,820
over HTTP and they will try to hijack

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,820
your login passwords and session cookies

50
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,370
what kind of badly I do

51
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,970
inject him some contents in your web

52
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,850
page redirect you are your users to a

53
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,609
phishing websites stealing your logging

54
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,670
and passports stealing your cookies of

55
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,200
your existing sessions and replacing the

56
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:46,790
files you are downloading with some

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:50,950
markers now let's see the different

58
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,780
HTTPS implementations in the years 90s

59
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,149
typically we were seeing a lot of

60
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:00,680
websites doing the implementation of

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,510
HTTPS only for the login page so for the

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,329
login page your authentication you are

63
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,269
putting your credentials over HTTPS but

64
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:10,790
after we were redirected in HTTP and the

65
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,480
rest of your website

66
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:19,608
was in pure HTTP do you think it's a

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:24,349
secure architecture okay I think I think

68
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:28,219
you were the first one we will bring you

69
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:31,419
some gift after the talk so indeed it's

70
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:35,210
insufficient and security textures and

71
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:39,919
it's a possible indeed to sniff your

72
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:42,049
cookie and maybe get your login and

73
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:47,389
password but we can still hijacked your

74
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:50,180
current session unless of the full HTTP

75
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:52,280
implementations so you do are you are

76
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,990
doing the authentication in HTTPS and

77
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,440
the rest of the website is protected

78
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,750
also by gtps it will mitigate the past

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:09,860
spoofing but will it mitigates all the

80
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:11,240
cases indeed you have some gift it will

81
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,330
not always mitigate all the

82
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,599
man-in-the-middle attack the there is

83
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:26,599
still don't with possible in some cases

84
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:33,020
so we will see a demo so here we have a

85
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:35,690
specific website that has been so kind

86
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,549
of a wiki specially done for the end of

87
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:44,960
today and we can see it's running in

88
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:49,449
HTTP we ever saw a virtual machine a

89
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,448
Windows 7 it's on a LAN

90
00:05:54,379 --> 00:06:02,909
and we have a Kali Linux on the same

91
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:09,059
land on the tele Linux will do some

92
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:12,270
poisoning we are running some tool to do

93
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:15,899
it very easy and then the users will

94
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:19,589
connect to the web sites but it will not

95
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:22,199
enter the full URL you will only put the

96
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:25,259
name of the website without the prefix

97
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:30,449
in HTTP of course because everybody is

98
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:33,479
doing like this as you can see we have

99
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:38,669
some already some hit now the user will

100
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:42,389
put is logging and upwards very testing

101
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:47,008
P it's in HTTP but there is some block

102
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:56,819
worm is the favicon - they look like an

103
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:58,769
HTTP web sites he wrote on it but on the

104
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:10,789
other side we got your login and

105
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:10,789
password yes

106
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:21,550
no indeed mister

107
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:29,800
demo for this event but there's nothing

108
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:32,530
to do with the day even okay so start

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,190
the possible mitigations it's just yes

110
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:39,179
it's a header transport security your

111
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:44,789
browser is doing a query in HTTP and

112
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,789
your web server will answer with a Dora

113
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,969
thanks to this header the browser will

114
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:57,099
know who is forced ways to connect to

115
00:07:51,970 --> 00:08:00,430
the website in HTTPS you can use this in

116
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:03,580
combination with HTTP redirects HTTP to

117
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,970
HTTPS and all the future connections

118
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:13,150
will always done in HTTPS until the

119
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:14,889
expiration of the value if the

120
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,669
connection is not possible like it's

121
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:20,289
blocked by a firewall or by an attacker

122
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:23,940
they will know don't read too HTTP

123
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:26,889
possible another feature interesting

124
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,020
there is no possibility to bypass to

125
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:32,349
Odin exceptions is a certificate is

126
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:36,159
invalid like not matching the name of

127
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:40,810
the URL or it's expired you will not be

128
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:45,160
able to an exception in your browser as

129
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:46,869
you can see no exceptions button so this

130
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,939
will mitigate the passage scuffing it

131
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,480
will mitigate an attacks like we saw

132
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,829
with the Raspberry Pi in the post on top

133
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,339
and we together so some man in the

134
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:59,290
middle attacks so let's see know if you

135
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,800
want to implement this I will recommend

136
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,990
it what you can do first you can choose

137
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,240
you do it for specific domains or

138
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,820
subdomains or you do it for all your

139
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,589
domains if you do it's only for one

140
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,920
specific domain I will always recommend

141
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:19,600
you to do it for your domain calm but

142
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:22,149
also with the triple W before let's talk

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,020
about the difference optionals

144
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:28,950
options that you can implement the first

145
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,230
ones the include subdomains

146
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,930
this will give you the possibility to

147
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,880
automatically implement HSTs for all

148
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:41,579
your subdomains for interesting features

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:44,339
you need to have all CTP all your

150
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:47,849
websites in HTTPS of a domain if you

151
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:52,139
have some websites on in HTTP they will

152
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:54,060
not be accessible anymore moreover you

153
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,959
have the possibility to add your

154
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,790
websites on a pillared list and this

155
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,670
list is supported by most of the Power

156
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:08,339
Cell it will mitigate the first attack

157
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:12,839
to 4 because it's already are coded in

158
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:14,579
your browser this parameter is

159
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,760
considered a highest benefit by the

160
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:20,209
Mozilla security sheet which is a very

161
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,069
good website I recommend you to look

162
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:29,489
give you many tips to secure your

163
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:31,139
websites so some questions always is

164
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,170
still possible to do a man-in-the-middle

165
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:41,570
attack on a website not part of the

166
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:54,199
pillar list somebody have an ID indeed

167
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:56,699
another ID the expiration yeah indeed

168
00:10:54,199 --> 00:11:00,949
NTP attack time-based and the first

169
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,949
collections you get some gift

170
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,370
another limitations is the question

171
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:10,880
about the privacy it's possible for a

172
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:14,940
webmaster to implement some specific

173
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,410
links and with subdomains that could be

174
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,649
leads to a finger pointing of the

175
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,649
browser

176
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,139
we had a look about what's the

177
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:26,899
difference implementation in HSTs in the

178
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:29,509
normal mode and incognito mode the

179
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,730
private modes so you know it's when you

180
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:33,980
want to serve some some website and you

181
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:37,609
don't really want that's a it's part of

182
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,819
your history yeah it could be some

183
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:43,459
websites you don't want your wife she

184
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:45,919
has a look about it then there is a

185
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:48,738
specific private mode of Nita mode in

186
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,819
the browser and we had to look yeah if

187
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:54,709
you connect with the normal mode

188
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:58,429
standard mode and then you connect in

189
00:11:54,709 --> 00:12:02,179
incognito mode do they share the same

190
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:05,569
cache of HSTs or do they have a separate

191
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:10,220
cache depending on the browser's we can

192
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:13,189
see that it's a different approach we've

193
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,470
talked about the different incognito

194
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:18,199
mode so you have a first win window you

195
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:24,109
can eat to modern you open a new one to

196
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:29,059
the share the same cache another

197
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:32,059
features very OCSP so what is a CSP in

198
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:34,699
it in HTTP the clients needs to validate

199
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:39,108
that the server certificate is not

200
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:42,069
revoked so the typical way of doing it

201
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:45,259
it's a CL certification revocation list

202
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:48,049
but the problem it's the list which is

203
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:52,129
growing and called introduced some in

204
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:55,239
Latin see OCSP online certificate status

205
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:59,749
protocol it's more rights but request

206
00:12:55,239 --> 00:13:02,299
another query to the OCSP responder

207
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:04,549
so let's look about it's working you

208
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:06,350
have your browser's doing a query DNS

209
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:09,649
query to get the IP address to

210
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,569
connecting to the websites then in the

211
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,119
website they will don't know certificate

212
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:17,660
the certificates contain the rest of the

213
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:20,299
OCSP responders those ESP responders

214
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:23,419
she needs a DNS query to get the IP

215
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:26,529
address and finally you can do your

216
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,529
checked and access the website

217
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,829
so what are the limitations there is a

218
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,439
privacy issue because the certification

219
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:37,258
authority with those GSP responders can

220
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:41,699
potentially track the website you are

221
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:45,360
visiting and what's happening if the SIS

222
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:48,689
responders is not answering to

223
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,850
possibility either you stop and there is

224
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,579
a potential problem of availability in

225
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:58,279
our service or you continue and then you

226
00:13:53,579 --> 00:14:01,069
could connect to some websites where the

227
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:04,970
certificate is potentially compromised

228
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:07,860
what does Firefox today the implements a

229
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:13,259
way to continue where you can easily

230
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:18,870
change it in your browsers OCSP stapling

231
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:20,579
it's another way it's not the browsers

232
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,550
that will initiate the connection is the

233
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:26,969
servers and the advantage is that in one

234
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,609
query you will get your web page the

235
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,220
content of the website you are visiting

236
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:36,110
but also the confirmation that the

237
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,110
certificate is not Revolt

238
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:47,699
hpk P still an under HTTP header this it

239
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:51,269
will find the certification Authority so

240
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:54,540
in place of visiting our web sites and

241
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:57,350
any certification authority that have

242
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,800
trusted in your browsers a valid only

243
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:06,959
specific specific certificate will will

244
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:10,920
be allowed to connect we will be very

245
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:14,930
did by the browser there are some

246
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,930
different case of yes the question

247
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:41,670
yes this correct yes yes indeed we will

248
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:44,010
see it in few slides do and yeah so

249
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,569
there are some foreign certificates we

250
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:49,260
can see different gains of both the past

251
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:55,440
years in foreign countries but indeed

252
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:58,050
it's so this is the way you need to

253
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,130
implement it you need to use different

254
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:06,810
keys it's quite complex to implement

255
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:11,300
there is a way of reporting incidents

256
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:14,010
you can put a URL and the browser's will

257
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,490
post some informations unfortunately

258
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,750
it's nuts

259
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:22,560
or is not really supported you can pin a

260
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:26,970
root or intermediate CA and there is

261
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:30,650
also list of billeted certificate it

262
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,650
will not interfere with SSL decryption

263
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,970
but indeed they are different limitation

264
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,640
is not widely supported first connection

265
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:47,400
is removed not protected you have a

266
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:53,910
problem of hostel pinning that could be

267
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:56,040
leads of hacker that will install some

268
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,650
private key on your website which is

269
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,040
hacked the customers they will connect

270
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,589
to the websites and then the hacker

271
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,089
could deletes the keys and force you to

272
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:11,669
pay a ransom to giving you the keys

273
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:15,109
otherwise all your visitors will not be

274
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,110
able to visit the website anymore

275
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:27,319
yes you could if you have like PayPal or

276
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:31,580
e-commerce websites it could be

277
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:34,940
extremely dangerous so

278
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,659
masya recommends to only implement it

279
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:43,549
for maximum risk science that recommends

280
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:45,650
for most of the sites no other

281
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,918
interesting features will not go to

282
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,809
other particles but BFS perfect for

283
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:55,429
secrecy

284
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:58,340
its features that allows you to protect

285
00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:00,710
the traffic against the future

286
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,139
possibility of the crispness of the

287
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,140
current starts transactions

288
00:18:35,340 --> 00:19:10,139
you seems to have a good knowledge body

289
00:18:37,990 --> 00:19:10,140
so I propose you explain it yes yes

290
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:19,900
thank you for your remark so we have

291
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,500
another certification transparency

292
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,690
it's a frameworks that will allow you to

293
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:31,920
monitors and look at the certification

294
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:37,900
generations the NACA it's a DNS entry

295
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:43,180
quite interesting that we'll only on the

296
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:45,880
few entries - only so you know of some

297
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,970
certification authority to generate a

298
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,960
certificate for you domain so you do a

299
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,010
sort of right listing of the

300
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,830
certification authority that are allowed

301
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:59,920
to generate a certificate for you it's

302
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:04,449
not mandatory but unfortunately it has

303
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:07,180
only be recently added to Amazon with 53

304
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,870
and still not supported by all the DNS

305
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:13,440
providers so let's see an example or to

306
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,439
implement it

307
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:22,140
so we did some research about what's

308
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,260
what's the different options and all

309
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,040
they are implemented in Luxembourg to do

310
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:32,100
it we take the country

311
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:35,070
Luxembourg on alexa.com but we only took

312
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:40,439
the TLD da tell you and we look about

313
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:44,700
the different parameters of features and

314
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:50,850
order implemented so for the top 60 of

315
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:57,120
the TLD dot Lu we have 51 website in

316
00:20:50,850 --> 00:21:01,469
HTTP sums are HTTP and HTTPS and 9

317
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,830
website in HTTP only to have an idea

318
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:13,820
about how many websites are using it's

319
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:20,100
STS the row no it's more lets port in %

320
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:27,059
15 so 15 up sides have implement it's

321
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:30,659
STS fat the person's quite good

322
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:34,200
apparently compared to what's net craft

323
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:42,179
wrote about its last year HP kept in

324
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:48,559
your body it's extremely not use OCSP

325
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:58,860
stapling to websites the NSE to websites

326
00:21:48,559 --> 00:22:01,350
BFS 43 different algorithms some are

327
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,809
using good implementations some are

328
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:10,379
still using like SSL version to version

329
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:13,500
3 thank you so no this cattle bit about

330
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:17,910
it how many people in these rooms are

331
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:24,940
webmasters or managing a web site

332
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:33,190
quite a lot do you have a HTTP web sites

333
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:36,130
only or HTTP did you implement it's just

334
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:47,050
yes not yet

335
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:55,780
okay good point to some would you have a

336
00:22:47,050 --> 00:23:05,350
question yes we will go back to the

337
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:09,870
slide so the DNA CA we have the

338
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:13,090
possibility to configure DNS records and

339
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,580
you will do the list of the

340
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:21,459
certification authority that are allow

341
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:23,649
to generate certification for you when

342
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:28,540
somebody will request the certification

343
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:30,550
authority to generate a certificate the

344
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,040
certificate authority to the authority

345
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,659
will do the NS query and they will they

346
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,000
will see if they're in the the world

347
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,340
list or not if you didn't implement it

348
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,150
they will consider it's okay if you

349
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:46,689
implement it even though this whitelist

350
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:48,670
then they will generate a certificate if

351
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,660
they are not in the whitelist they will

352
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:54,760
not enter certificates and you have the

353
00:23:51,660 --> 00:24:00,610
positive to add an email address and

354
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:04,650
they will send an incident with to the

355
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,649
imagery dimensions you

356
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,570
by in supported yes maybe nonetheless

357
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,130
the the old version but the last

358
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:21,500
versions are supporting it

359
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:25,970
you can also mention which certificate

360
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,909
says which domain you want to use

361
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:31,250
subdomains are supported and you can

362
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:57,890
also give a specific entry for the vault

363
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:59,990
or certificate let's say you're not

364
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,120
exchanging any critical data whatsoever

365
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:13,370
would I still be use case would use

366
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:16,070
regular HTTP or not I will recommend to

367
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,750
always use HTTPS and to implement the

368
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,928
subdomain

369
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:22,760
but of course this depending about what

370
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:28,490
you want to do your data classification

371
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:31,700
and but it's today extremely easy to

372
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:34,480
enable HTTPS so I will recommend to do

373
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,480
it for your subdomains

374
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:45,110
yeah we've let's encrypt you can even

375
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:49,209
get free certificates so the the custard

376
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,209
will be an argument anymore

377
00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:02,040
I was not running exactly but I think

378
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:05,120
you went through the slides right so

379
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:09,870
yeah any other questions that you have

380
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:14,540
not already so here for me

381
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:16,949
we heard the mm-hmm sorry the the

382
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,290
presentation about checking the email

383
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:22,170
security and email crypto so some of

384
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:28,170
these newer features I don't think that

385
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:32,520
does does tools like SSL labs check for

386
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:35,100
these kind of settings for example what

387
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:38,940
kind of great do you get with SSL labs

388
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,830
if you have h k PK enabled for example

389
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,400
is it going to be a positive thing

390
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:46,590
negative thing so all those features

391
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,070
they are available in SSL lab including

392
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:54,689
the NACA including HP KP excluding all

393
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:57,600
the rest if you want to have a priest

394
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:02,450
today you need to implement HSTs with a

395
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:06,899
long period for the rest they will not

396
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:10,050
give you an extra ranking but only a

397
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:14,840
banner with like if you see other stuff

398
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,840
this will be mentioned as extra banner

399
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:24,060
concerning HP kept in there is a no new

400
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:28,379
header that has been published quite

401
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,850
recently and you will not block the

402
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,920
connection anymore but only doing a

403
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,919
reporting Facebook is using it like this

404
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:40,050
so basically way it will go as they

405
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,360
we're not gonna phase it out we just

406
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,100
gonna make sure that we won't be able to

407
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,040
like if you make a mistake that is

408
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:51,270
called the cage key now PK

409
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,830
suicide or someone else you ransom so

410
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,780
you think that that's the direction

411
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,510
where this because this is really a

412
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,370
debated feature like I think just a

413
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,530
month ago in risky business there was a

414
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,510
full interview just on this feature so

415
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,520
there's this quite a debate going on

416
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,990
with this you think that that's the

417
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
direction where it will go or we will

418
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,980
like

419
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,960
doubt and just back up like saying okay

420
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,660
maybe this was not the best idea so what

421
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,350
do you think it's what we'll have as

422
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,540
future for this personally I think the

423
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:28,790
reporting tag is extremely interesting

424
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:32,090
to use and only has only advantage yeah

425
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:34,280
I will definitely recommend to implement

426
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,610
modes of features to assist be stopping

427
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,800
this is not giving you extremely high

428
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:43,310
security it's not just a different way

429
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:52,909
of to implement it but it is certainly

430
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:55,220
something to implement anybody else okay

431
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,320
real a little bit earlier but I think I

432
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,020
don't know is the break is already

433
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,179
already there or it's already done yeah

434
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,470
okay so coffee coffee at least is there

435
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:08,090
probably on snacks or things yeah oh

436
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:13,820
yeah gift gift yeah let's let's give out

437
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:21,590
the gifts before we go for a break looks

438
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:25,370
like booze I should have I should have

439
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:32,860
paid more attention maybe nobody told me

440
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:36,560
that that's the present yeah okay so if

441
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:39,500
nothing else to add then let's go for

442
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:44,600
the break and yeah what do you want with

443
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:47,630
that battle oh nice oh very good very

444

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,030

447
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,240
big we're gonna do the summary

448
