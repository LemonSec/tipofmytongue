1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:09,889
good morning my name is Martin and I

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,670
want to talk to you about email server

3
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:15,910
testing and let me start with a simple

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,920
example so what is the first thing

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,900
basically everyone does when they put a

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,320
web server online these days

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,560
well many times what you do after it is

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,490
deployed and online you check the score

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,729
on SSL labs which is a fine thing

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,829
because we can save the claim that SSL

11
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:40,489
Epps has made the internet a safer place

12
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:42,050
because it's bad for your reputation if

13
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,029
you have a bad score there so people

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,349
will tell you about it and you will fix

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:51,979
it until you have an A or your otherwise

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,350
satisfied with the result and so this is

17
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:57,620
good in the end because it keeps the web

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:02,559
safer it keeps bad configurations out of

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:05,960
the picture the drawback is

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,470
mess-ups only works with HTTPS websites

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,940
now the question is what would you do

22
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,310
when you put a different server online

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:18,830
that uses TLS somehow what you do if you

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,670
put a web email server online for

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,490
example SMTP IMAP pop whatever and the

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:30,260
answer is there's no good right now that

27
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:34,869
would do a comprehensive report for you

28
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,940
like SSS does and that's a pity because

29
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:42,140
it's not so different as you can imagine

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,880
TLS stays TLS wherever it is used and so

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,390
the question is why don't we have a tool

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,610
like that wouldn't it be great to have a

33
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,730
tool that not only allows you to test

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:56,780
web servers but also allows you to test

35
00:01:52,730 --> 00:02:01,460
smtp I might pop or other protocol to

36
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:03,530
claim that uses TLS and yeah it would be

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,929
great and that's why I'm here today

38
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,490
because the answer is we are working on

39
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,679
something like this we want to give you

40
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:13,909
a tool that allows you to do all of

41
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,310
these things we haven't came up with a

42
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:18,469
good yet so that's all work in progress

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,709
or sometimes we just call it the project

44
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:24,530
and that is to be discussed that's a bit

45
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:28,450
lengthy here but I guess more important

46
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:32,540
for you is what does this thing do and

47
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,638
it's pretty simple well it's very

48
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,540
similar to what you do with SSL apps you

49
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:43,279
have a HTML interface there's a form

50
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,769
where you put your email host in there

51
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:48,799
you hit OK and what you get back is a

52
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,680
report it's not just about TLS but it's

53
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:56,480
also about DNS records because it's also

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,579
important for email and yeah that's

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,790
pretty much it and how can you use that

56
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:04,029
while we see too typical use cases well

57
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,888
first of all there are private persons

58
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:09,560
so for them it might be interesting to

59
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:11,120
see if their email provider well if

60
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,249
they're let's say you have an account

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,639
with Gmail or something then you want to

62
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:19,279
see if they do things the right way but

63
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:23,359
I think a more important use case would

64
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:26,599
be similar to how SSL Apps is also used

65
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:28,639
these days you use this as a tool to

66
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,409
validate your setup let's say you put an

67
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,319
email server online then you can

68
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:37,849
immediately check if things are going ok

69
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:40,700
for you and we believe this is a good

70
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:43,369
idea because email security is important

71
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,409
because it's still is one of the major

72
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,040
places that an attacker looks for these

73
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:53,689
days but note that we just care about

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,749
email servers we do not have a focus on

75
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:59,719
things like PGP or other client-side

76
00:03:56,749 --> 00:04:01,999
technologies which of course we welcome

77
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:03,940
and endorse but that's not the focus of

78
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:06,040
our tool

79
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,460
let's talk about the history of the

80
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,730
project bit how this all came to be and

81
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:16,690
like any good project first of all there

82
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:19,000
was a proof of concept and this was

83
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,370
sponsored by the Ministry of Economy and

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,400
security made in Luxembourg thanks to

85
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,470
them and the goal was as always for

86
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,609
proof of concept get it running as

87
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,050
quickly as possible

88
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,310
and that we did what were the features

89
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:38,140
of the proof-of-concept

90
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:40,300
we tried to show a lot for what was

91
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,719
possible in a short time while we did

92
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:47,550
the DNS records so it fetched DNS

93
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,980
records like TLS a CA d mark and SPF and

94
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,740
we also did a basic TLS analysis and

95
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:57,580
because that's the meat of the checks

96
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:00,760
and validations to implement we took an

97
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,400
existing tool called SSL decoder in

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,670
order to bootstrap the process so this

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,030
gave us a lot of the tests that we could

100
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:12,790
also display to users and it already

101
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,270
offered a JSON interface so it was easy

102
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:20,890
for us to use this in our own DNS record

103
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,960
checks and this was the architecture of

104
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:27,460
the proof-of-concept still pretty simple

105
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:31,870
the main important thing is there in

106
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:35,530
this gap here where we forward the TLS

107
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:38,350
analysis to SSL decoder we do DNS record

108
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,330
analysis in our own application and then

109
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,419
we combine the two and show them to the

110
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:47,289
user so the user fills in a form hit

111
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:50,229
center rails app does DNS record lookup

112
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:53,700
forwards TLS analysis deal ssl dakota

113
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:56,290
combines initials so pretty simple and

114
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,400
here are some images of what it was able

115
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:04,870
to do so here you can see the DNS record

116
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,479
displayed for Gmail here's another

117
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,820
example of the class features so that's

118
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,370
very similar to what you know from

119
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,340
something like SSL apps it shows the

120
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,440
protocols cipher Suites certain features

121
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,710
if it's vulnerable against

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,290
things are not and finally the service

123
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,299
certificate so any service sends a

124
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,610
certificate chain and then the chain is

125
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,700
listed each certificate is analyzed with

126
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:34,390
its details but as you can already see

127
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:36,610
all the values are in black so we didn't

128
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,490
do any assessment in the proof of

129
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:46,200
concept we just listed the details but

130
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:46,200
didn't do any evaluation we ran into

131
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:54,760
interesting problem since we wanted to

132
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,859
focus on email security and we wanted to

133
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,380
cover all the DNS records that are

134
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,590
important for email security of course

135
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,170
we also wanted to include dekum but the

136
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,719
problem is you cannot analyze dekum

137
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,210
without having an actual email and let's

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,640
look at a reason for this if you look up

139
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:20,200
the DNS record in DNS for dekum then the

140
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:22,900
string you need to look up is composed

141
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,969
of two fixed parts in the middle you

142
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,729
have to fix string underscore domain key

143
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,430
and at the end you have the domain that

144
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,750
you're examining but the problem is this

145
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,380
part here in the front there's a

146
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,600
selector and if you look at the

147
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,450
specification this selector can be

148
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,550
anything basically and it's even advice

149
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:46,090
to rotate this and to keep it

150
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,630
unguessable so that means we in our tool

151
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:53,109
cannot know this value are in advance

152
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,480
and so that means basically we cannot

153
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,530
look up the record so how can we solve

154
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,750
this problem well we need an actual

155
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,539
email sent from that domain that

156
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,310
contains a decom header and once we have

157
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,770
that email we can look in the dica

158
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,140
matter and see what the selector value

159
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,680
actually is once we know the selector

160
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:19,750
value we can look up the dns record

161
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,759
and this drawback let into phase 2 there

162
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,030
was another big feature which I'm going

163
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,039
to talk afterwards but this was really

164
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,719
one of the issues we wanted to solve in

165
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,848
a second phase we wanted to solve this

166
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,830
decommission and how do we get an email

167
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,409
first we thought about solutions for

168
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,659
this and I mean if we need an email from

169
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:43,330
somewhere then let's just send an email

170
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,819
and we pretty quickly came up with the

171
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,670
idea of doing old-school web service

172
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:52,750
style sent an email to a service and get

173
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:54,640
an email back and at first we thought

174
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,230
this was an excuse but if you think

175
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,290
about it we're talking about email

176
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,330
security here so in the end I think it

177
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,579
really feels natural so if you want to

178
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:08,050
talk about email security why not send

179
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:10,600
an actual email and this we thought it

180
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,420
was a good idea and phase 2 was again

181
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,410
sponsored by the same sponsors so we

182
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:21,459
could implement this and it led us to a

183
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,959
new problem if we do send emails do we

184
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:26,349
really want to go through the whole

185
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,619
effort of taking this HTML report that

186
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,810
we had and put this in an email well not

187
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,089
really it would happen

188
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,790
I mean it's doable but it would have

189
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:40,240
taken a lot of time so what we wanted to

190
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,579
have is not sending a report but we

191
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,650
would just send back a reply telling

192
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,550
people ok your report is ready here at

193
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:52,660
this URL go there and view it and then

194
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,579
we would just show them the same report

195
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,719
that they would see if they go to the

196
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,400
HTML web forum the problem with this is

197
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,180
if we want to do it that way if you

198
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,170
think it through

199
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:07,719
it's a synchronous so we have a request

200
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:10,870
we produced a result but the request

201
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,450
comes later so we need to temporarily at

202
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,900
least store the risk on somewhere we

203
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:19,150
can't put it in a database because that

204
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,939
would mean we could collect data and

205
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,770
sell this data or whatever at least we

206
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,420
don't want to collect data about our

207
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,910
customers we just want to give you a

208
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,849
good tool and so that's

209
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,650
not an option to put it in a database

210
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,920
but I mentioned we just need it

211
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:38,980
temporarily and so the solution is we

212
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,020
cache the result for a given time right

213
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,170
now it's an hour and after an hour the

214
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,390
result is gone again and this has also

215
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,640
other benefits we can cache a lot of

216
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,530
things if you think about it a lot of

217
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,600
times you will download the same C or

218
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,550
else the same intermediate certificates

219
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,240
and all of that stuff this could also be

220
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,569
cached in the future and for phase two

221
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,120
we actually had to expand our

222
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,850
architecture a bit mostly because of the

223
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,280
email feature so if you use the web form

224
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,160
everything works as before as you can

225
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,170
see we integrated the SSL decoder parts

226
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,319
into the application as a cell decoders

227
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,810
are no longer in there but we have three

228
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,170
new components so let's walk it through

229
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:26,199
every user decides to send an email it's

230
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,599
received by node.js front end which is

231
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,510
using the note mailer API which is a

232
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,090
perfect tool for our use case because it

233
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,840
can act as an SMTP server parse the

234
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:40,030
email and then just create some JSON to

235
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,170
forward it using a REST API to the

236
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:46,800
application itself so to the user it

237
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,719
will look just like any SMTP server

238
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,060
parses the email sends us the important

239
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,300
features including dekum whatever we

240
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,579
need and now this trick is a background

241
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,790
job in the application background Java

242
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:05,470
produces the result serializes it into

243
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:07,599
JSON stores it in the cache once done an

244
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:12,160
email is generated containing a link

245
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,200
with an unnecessary can inner set peer

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,719
results it's just for you and we sent

247
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,230
this email using postfix soco's fixes

248
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,810
just for outgoing SMTP here now user

249
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,520
receives the email with the link we'll

250
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,589
decide to click on the link open it in a

251
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,410
browser or something and this will

252
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,820
trigger a new request to the app and the

253
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,110
app will fetch the cached result

254
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,110
displayed as usually

255
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:43,169
now besides these synchronous features

256
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:45,358
our other big feature that we wanted to

257
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:47,850
include in the second phase is actually

258
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:50,639
doing some parts of evaluation in the

259
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:55,889
proof-of-concept we just have black text

260
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,479
no judgement but here in Phase two we

261
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,419
also wanted to give you some indication

262
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:05,100
whether something is good or bad or if

263
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:07,439
it's fine just as it is and we added a

264
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,809
new face so in the proof-of-concept we

265
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:13,589
just had these three things so it was a

266
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:16,079
linear process incoming requests from

267
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,089
the request we collect all the data and

268
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,998
then we present that data to the user

269
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:24,419
now in Phase two we added a second step

270
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:26,100
after the data is collected we create an

271
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,350
internal data structure and then this

272
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:33,149
internal data structure is evaluated so

273
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:35,160
it contains all the all the data that is

274
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,229
needed to evaluate it and we produce

275
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,189
another data structure containing the

276
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:44,160
evaluation and a combination of this is

277
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:47,248
then presented to the user and this

278
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,618
helps us to show our different reports

279
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:52,129
I'm gonna just show you some quick

280
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:55,949
examples of what it would look like

281
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:59,480
these are just saved pages that I did on

282
00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:02,969
some test runs so first of all this is a

283
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,889
HTTP test so not actually email which is

284
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:10,169
for our own website to show you that

285
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:14,209
we're doing things mostly fine so many

286
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:18,149
green values no red values that's good

287
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:21,920
and now I want to show you two quick

288
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:25,890
examples for emails

289
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:29,579
for example yes yahoo mail that's

290
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:33,300
interesting Yahoo's website is pretty

291
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:36,540
much top-notch if you look at it on as a

292
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,729
salads for example or with our tool but

293
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,180
if you look at the email you will notice

294
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:48,690
that here and I'm gonna zoom in so you

295
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:51,750
can see that better if you look at their

296
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,580
email setup they still I mean it's

297
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,040
debatable if you still want to support

298
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,960
our c4 with sha-1 because some

299
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,420
old-school clients might need it but our

300
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,000
c4 with md5 should definitely be banned

301
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,250
and this is this is the point that we

302
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,230
want to make with this tool their web

303
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,180
server is top-notch because of tools

304
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:16,050
like SSL apps because there's public

305
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:19,050
public analysis possible and so this

306
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:27,569
would help also to expose glitches like

307
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:30,689
this and the question is now that phase

308
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:33,450
2 is implemented where do we want to go

309
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,480
in the future and we have a lot of ideas

310
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:39,060
first of all telling you whether it's

311
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,380
something is green yellow or red is good

312
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:46,319
it helps you to fix things but it is not

313
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,470
really well to compare like you can't

314
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,050
tell is this site any better than this

315
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:56,940
or are these flaws really that important

316
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:59,099
to do such are to present such a result

317
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,870
we need some form of scoring like SSL

318
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,660
apps has it's grades we need to know

319
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:07,440
score too and so what we want to act in

320
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,079
phase 3 let's call it is another phase

321
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,320
that takes the evaluation and then puts

322
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,480
Waits and scores to that and then

323
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,750
outputs these grades or scores to the

324
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,520
user so that's one thing but if we start

325
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:25,440
doing that at least if we want to be

326
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,050
want to be understandable to people and

327
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,780
then we need to explain ourselves we

328
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,640
need to give a reasoning for why we give

329
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,930
certain

330
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,160
evaluations because it's useless if you

331
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,170
just tell them

332
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,110
this is bad you have to have a reason

333
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,089
for why it's bad but if we need to do

334
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,970
this then it's automatically also means

335
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,580
we need to provide documentation and if

336
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,370
we provide documentation why not make it

337
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,310
useful for everybody we can you also use

338
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,740
this for educational purposes like

339
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,020
having a wiki or something that tells

340
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,300
you about what is important in TLS and

341
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:04,920
what are the mistakes or things to watch

342
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:08,099
out for if you want to use this in a

343
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,990
company context then I could imagine you

344
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:14,219
could use this in automated processes

345
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,140
for example monitoring checking every

346
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,300
week if my email server is still ok

347
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,820
things like that and then it's awkward

348
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,399
to just have an HTML form as your

349
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,399
primary interface so it would be much

350
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,830
better for a company to have a real Web

351
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,860
API so you could directly access the

352
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,629
results you have a JSON response which

353
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,629
is documented and you can evaluate that

354
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,780
response and act upon it so that's

355
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,910
certainly something for the future -

356
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,580
another big thing that I know from

357
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,280
personal experience a lot of companies

358
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,080
are a little bit uneasy about using

359
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,879
something like us to sell apps because

360
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,330
they don't know what they do on their

361
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:59,490
service with the results and that's one

362
00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:01,860
one thing against using it another one

363
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,190
maybe even more important you can only

364
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,979
test once the service online so if it's

365
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,380
bad to set up if it's bad it's already

366
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,450
been published online and that's awkward

367
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,430
you you would much rather want to do

368
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,950
something where you test this stuff

369
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,750
internally in your own network and only

370
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,980
if it's good then you're gonna publish

371
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,570
it and to do such a thing you can't use

372
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,490
a web application because the web

373
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,879
application itself needs to have public

374
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,280
access to that server so we're thinking

375
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,870
about a command-line interface because

376
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,629
you could use this anywhere in your

377
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:39,149
private networks get a report in your

378
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,340
private network and then once you're

379
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:44,070
satisfied with the results only then you

380
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,480
could publish the server and put it

381
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,679
online

382
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,590
and yeah TLS is at the core of every

383
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,410
validation in all of the email protocols

384
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:59,760
also for web servers but there are a lot

385
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:02,220
more TLS based protocols FTP XMPP

386
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,090
whatever you can imagine that uses TLS

387
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,770
it could all be a part of this and of

388
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,870
course there are specific things that

389
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,200
are only important in specific context

390
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:15,419
but a lot of things and validations and

391
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,250
checks are common to all different

392
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,550
protocols so we could use this as a

393
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:23,280
basis if you look at the tool I will

394
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,830
publish the URL right after the talk

395
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,540
here then you will see it's compared to

396
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,280
SSL apps there are a lot of things

397
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,710
missing and of course we want to catch

398
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,440
up and since we are also concentrating

399
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,210
on DNS records we want to also want to

400
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,610
catch up with our good tools in that

401
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,730
sector maybe you've heard of MX toolbox

402
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:46,590
and so we want to be on par with all of

403
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:49,800
them the tool itself is open source and

404
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:52,260
to make it useful our ultimate goal is

405
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,629
to create a community around it because

406
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,170
only then we can evolve it to the point

407
00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:00,270
where we see it in the future but as you

408
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:03,330
know billing community is hard

409
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:06,000
it needs sponsors partnerships we don't

410
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,970
want to be the only ones who decide

411
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,220
about things because we have a domain

412
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,830
knowledge but we can't cover all of the

413
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,020
aspects of all possible protocol so it

414
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,750
would be great if we have outside

415
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,090
experts who could tell us about other

416
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,790
protocols and who can give us their

417
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,709
insights and so all together we can come

418
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:29,310
up with a better tool with more tests

419
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:32,010
with relevant tests and ultimately the

420
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,379
perfect tool and that's really the

421
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,260
vision that we have for it so we can

422
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,450
build a perfect SSL apps for email if

423
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,810
everybody comes together if we share our

424
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:45,450
knowledge and if we can set up the tests

425
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,550
that everybody is ok with and the cool

426
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,370
thing is since this is all about TLS

427
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:53,730
mostly we can not only build a perfect

428
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:55,770
tool for email but we can really built a

429
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,450
perfect tool for TLS as a whole in

430
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:01,350
general

431
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:05,010
and that's the ultimate vision yeah so

432
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:07,530
thank you this is the email if you want

433
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:11,100
to test it it hasn't been battle tested

434
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:13,170
so please forgive us if anything goes

435
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,209
wrong and we would totally appreciate it

436
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:17,160
if you can send us any are things that

437
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,540
you noticed or improvements your

438
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,070
thoughts it's currently secured against

439
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,200
crawlers and robots so we have basic

440
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,320
authentication on there we have a

441
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,190
totally secure combination so username

442
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,139
is email password is secure and we would

443
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,730
really appreciate your feedback if you

444
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,520
want to please send us an email to

445
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:51,390
contact that email mate and Luxemburg

446
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:54,470
thank you questions remarks yes so that

447
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:58,500
was one as well okay so we go in order I

448
00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:00,810
am I think this is great I would really

449
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,430
love to have this I can I am going to

450
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:06,030
spread this in some communities that I

451
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:08,340
know that care about this friend of mine

452
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:15,000
actually made a service that tests Dane

453
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:17,189
records it's on have Dane net and he

454
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,140
actually made he was struggling with the

455
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,480
idea that you did you mentioned in

456
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,910
sending email because he you need to

457
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,620
receive an email he generates email

458
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,560
addresses and that you have to send him

459
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,439
so each sends imaged makes three email

460
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,200
addresses and you send an email to all

461
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,970
three and the website keeps polling and

462
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,610
once they receive all of the email

463
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,800
addresses or not he can generate the

464
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:44,110
results whether you check Dane or not

465
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,629
so that's a that's another way you could

466
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:53,800
do this it's open source as well so if

467
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:59,860
you need any sure yes of course yeah

468
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:01,120
then it's thanks for this I thank you

469
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,760
for your talk

470
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,389
first I can share this picture on

471
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:14,020
Twitter so everyone can see it or not no

472
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:15,850
I mean not that slide okay and second

473
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,040
question because I did share as

474
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:24,010
Something About You I get question on

475
00:23:18,040 --> 00:24:27,190
Twitter did he spoke about de M L say D

476
00:23:24,010 --> 00:24:28,330
mark okay well we're responding to

477
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:35,530
questions on Twitter

478
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:38,379
any questions here yeah did you have any

479
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:41,500
plans to also add something like history

480
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,150
or be able to compare reports I mean

481
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,150
it's a bit against what you said about

482
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,850
privacy as don't want to keep track of

483
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:51,490
information but it would make sense to

484
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:54,090
see when something happens when you

485
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,090
improve for

486
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,999
something changes right that's the

487
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:06,440
intent of it that that's actually a

488
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:09,349
pretty good idea thank you for that so

489
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,149
yeah but it's like you said it's kind of

490
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:14,119
works against the idea of not keeping

491
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:17,689
data maybe I could imagine something

492
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:20,570
like having an account so you can create

493
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:23,899
an account and that means your you want

494
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:26,059
to keep data and then we could keep the

495
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:28,369
data for people who who like to have

496
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:31,220
their data being kept in than accessing

497
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:40,309
history or in the command line version

498
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:41,599
yeah i mean if you store it on your

499
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:43,609
server because it's publicly available

500
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,259
you can either encrypt it with the

501
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:47,269
user's password or accounts password

502
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:50,210
with the sort of course or you can hash

503
00:25:47,269 --> 00:26:00,739
it so even if there is a data Rick only

504
00:25:50,210 --> 00:26:02,899
hashes are out and not the real data you

505
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:05,570
have to think about can I in advance

506
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:07,189
connect create a similar response and

507
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,470
then just check by comparing two hash

508
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,529
values like for example if you if you

509
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:15,799
keep hashes of a social security number

510
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:17,720
then there are not enough values you can

511
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,249
just iterate through the values create

512
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,929
the hashes and then look if one of those

513
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:25,879
is in there then you know that it's the

514
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:29,539
original data there should be enough

515
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:32,359
enough randomness in there yeah but also

516
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:34,039
the encrypting idea that's also good if

517
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:38,439
we have an account we can encrypt the

518
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:42,799
data by using a password derived key

519
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,320
okay yeah I try to keep in mind who's

520
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,639
who's next

521
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,399
so first thing thank you because that's

522
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:52,580
a very good interesting tool so thank

523
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:56,580
you for this and the other thing is

524
00:26:52,580 --> 00:27:00,899
until this tool the way

525
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:03,539
I used to check the security of an email

526
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:05,668
server was to rely on check TLS calm

527
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,010
which is unfortunately not open-source

528
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:10,590
but which which is checking the SSL

529
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,010
setting and the certificate chain of the

530
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,689
makes our so it's but it's not answering

531
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,279
the damask stuff and all the email

532
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,529
security setting so it's partially

533
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,720
answering to the question and there's a

534
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:24,269
very a tricky way to do it is just to

535
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,919
send an email from your mail server to a

536
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:28,980
gmail account and see if you have the

537
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,659
little icon and then you can also be

538
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,850
sure that you have TLS enabled or not on

539
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,980
your on your mail server and then I

540
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,590
getting the ID for the comparison what

541
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,590
you can also do is to to save the result

542
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,389
as a JSON file and then just to provide

543
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,340
an interface to compare to GS and file

544
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:46,320
from a previous test and a new test and

545
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,389
then you can easily compare and you

546
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,908
don't have to save the result on your on

547
00:27:48,389 --> 00:28:01,439
your back-end but that you just need to

548
00:27:50,909 --> 00:28:03,779
save the result we talked about what if

549
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,779
users because we can imagine use cases

550
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:08,850
of this where somebody creates a report

551
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,429
and then prints this to upper management

552
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,100
and they want to have a PDF for example

553
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:16,139
or they don't want to look at websites

554
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,959
so it would be interesting to have also

555
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:21,719
an export feature for PDF or you said

556
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,460
son and then you can create own tool

557
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:30,870
based on that that would be a good idea

558
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:34,710
I think so too Thanks thank you very

559
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:36,268
much fantastic work what I was thinking

560
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,490
now during your presentation is that

561
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:41,750
email servers usually have many

562
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:44,730
supportive services for example

563
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,850
anti-spam engine we know some of them

564
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,830
are bad some are good some are core open

565
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,269
source of our closed source some might

566
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,809
give information about the signature

567
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:57,389
that they're using the same applies for

568
00:28:54,809 --> 00:29:00,389
anti viruses and you already have that

569
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:04,729
information when you receive an email so

570
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:08,449
you could make a careful for example

571
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:10,279
assessment of what kind of spam engine

572
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,979
they're using

573
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:16,129
if they're not using that's an issue I

574
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:18,200
believe if anybody has set up here

575
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,869
Nemo's server knows very well that not

576
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:26,059
using a spam engine is like going out

577
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:30,379
totally naked your your food for the

578
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:32,119
spammers and antivirus there are many

579
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:33,799
UTM solutions that actually go in front

580
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,709
of the email server and put a bunch of

581
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:38,210
signature so take advantage of that by

582
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:42,769
all means but because that's email

583
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:46,549
security as well yeah actually that that

584
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:49,129
was also my thinking that you know with

585
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:50,960
with SSL I mean whoa your SSL sucks okay

586
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:52,699
well that's not really the end of the

587
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,700
world but with email we that's that's a

588
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,779
very good vector in order I mean

589
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,389
sometimes I don't even bother doing

590
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:02,330
anything just fish in the engagement if

591
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:04,968
we do red teaming so you probably want

592
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,639
to respond there and then you're next I

593
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:10,549
love this feedback because that is my

594
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:13,339
background is more crypto and SSL

595
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:16,039
focused so those are the DEA's ideas

596
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:18,830
that we definitely need to make this

597
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:21,529
really all around perfect solution

598
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,749
because I would tend to always focus on

599
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:25,639
the cypher stuff and so on and those are

600
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:27,369
the ideas that I like and that's why

601
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:29,748
it's so important for us to have

602
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:32,119
outsiders who bring us these ideas and

603
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:35,269
who want to get engaged so thank you for

604
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:37,728
the ideas and also does the idea to have

605
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:43,519
this discussion part I think Klaus you

606
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:44,889
were next I may have missed it

607
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,859
but did you also check the server

608
00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:52,839
permission settings I guess if the mail

609
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:52,839
server was open for an open mail relay

610
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:05,179
yeah and I was I was thinking like basic

611
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:07,339
stuff like I have to admit I had to run

612
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:09,320
around but something like verify so when

613
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:11,330
you can you know just enumerate things I

614
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,369
don't know if you do such a check when

615
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,658
you just want to collect but that is

616
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:17,899
easy to check because I mean if you

617
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:20,169
allow those commands them yeah that's

618
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:20,168
bad

619
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:30,540
yeah I know just I have just a few

620
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,680
comments about the presentation as

621
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:37,710
marking told you that the project it is

622
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:41,370
supported by the Ministry of Economy and

623
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:44,400
security made in Lu I will present them

624
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:48,209
home for the moment and I see I'm not a

625
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,190
tech guy so I didn't understand all the

626
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:55,710
questions but I see that there's a

627
00:31:50,190 --> 00:32:01,410
really an interest from you and yes I

628
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:05,100
just like to propose that if you want to

629
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:11,850
support a project we could talk together

630
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:15,389
and see the better way to involve you to

631
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:20,399
make it to improve it and perhaps to

632
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:24,360
help to fund it and yes to Martin show

633
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:28,020
that the the product was working at the

634
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,419
moment and pretty well and but there's

635
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,720
of course possibility to add some

636
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:39,300
features of we had some proposed today

637
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:43,110
and so I'd like to invite you or to talk

638
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:51,659
together or to send an email to the

639
00:32:43,110 --> 00:33:02,090
address of the yeah yeah yeah yeah

640
00:32:51,660 --> 00:33:10,410
indeed okay if you're okay yeah

641
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:14,990
sorry mikemonkey you go hello I've also

642
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:17,550
been using the the check TLS website

643
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:20,730
actually the information there is much

644
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:23,040
less granular that what you showed us so

645
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,090
it's it's very nice on the other end

646
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:30,290
most of the well as Lisa as far as I

647
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:32,929
know and I checked last time most of the

648
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:35,580
SMTP communication on the Internet today

649
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,980
is using opportunity of

650
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,020
mystic encryption so basically when you

651
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,730
have two smtp servers that connect to

652
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,960
each other they are doing a start TLS

653
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:48,750
and up to now people find it more well

654
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:53,010
better to actually receive email even in

655
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:56,520
if the TLS connection is broken so it is

656
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:59,300
nice to have the information that indeed

657
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:03,570
your TLS is working fine and you have

658
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:07,290
nice eyes and whatever but the point is

659
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:09,150
if you do a TLS strip attack and you

660
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,880
just remove the start TLS sequence

661
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:15,389
anyway it will bypass the encryption so

662
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:18,840
I think in the context of SMTP at least

663
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:21,120
today knowing which ciphers you are

664
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:25,230
using is not as important as on the

665
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:29,040
website and what would be really nice is

666
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:32,159
to know which servers SMTP servers are

667
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,900
actually checking that what they were

668
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,170
they was that they enforce the

669
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:39,060
encryption and if that would be doable

670
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,250
that would be nice

671
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,049
that would also maybe push people to

672
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:51,000
decide that maybe security is better

673
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:55,230
than just usability aspects so first of

674
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,620
all if you send us an email we check if

675
00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:02,130
that last hop comes in encrypted and if

676
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:04,049
it does not then we flagged us as a as a

677
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,000
bad thing which is something that Gmail

678
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:09,560
also does but this doesn't cover the

679
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,560
entire chain and that's

680
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:22,750
it's also to him you can just capture

681
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,760
this one point and that's true but and

682
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,309
we're also thinking about how can we

683
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,859
because that's another important issue

684
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:31,450
even if the last hop is encrypted that

685
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:34,150
doesn't mean that the entire Jane was

686
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:36,430
encrypted and if only one link is not

687
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,160
encrypted then the whole thing is moot

688
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,200
and yeah we're trying to imagine ways

689
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:57,819
how we could ensure because that would

690
00:35:41,200 --> 00:36:00,430
be the ultimate nice thing to have yeah

691
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:04,500
I'm it's this is hard to do to give a

692
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:07,899
definite answer to to this but you can

693
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,359
at least we can try to detect some

694
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:15,220
things that might point there another

695
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:17,950
thing is so when they send email if we

696
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:21,549
we can try to connect it to their SMTP

697
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:25,419
server try to not use start TLS and to

698
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:27,519
do it and then that's a check that I've

699
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,000
actually been working on but it's not in

700
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:33,549
integrated yet to connect to them try to

701
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,500
send email unencrypted and see if they

702
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:37,529
accept it because there are some

703
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,960
configurations that would not accept

704
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:43,720
behavior like this and and yeah it's

705
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,319
that's that's the important thing to

706
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,000
take away here I I believe as we saw in

707
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:51,788
the discussion everybody has has good

708
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,009
ideas that I never came up with and so

709
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:55,720
it would be so awesome for us all to

710
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:58,259
work together and at least share our

711
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,259
ideas

712
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,370
all the all the people that have a sin

713
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,190
teepee set up today they still want to

714
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:13,960
be able to receive emails from sources

715
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:16,760
that do not support the LS encryption so

716
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,410
you need to make sure that at the point

717
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,760
where you decide to do that of course

718
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:24,500
you can still receive significant amount

719
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,900
of emails because if you do that today I

720
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,750
think you will block everything and so

721
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,120
yeah the initiatives like this are nice

722
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,530
because of course it pushed people to

723
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,650
have good configuration in the first

724
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:39,650
place and then in the future you can you

725
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:42,500
can in insight indeed decide to turn it

726
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:44,300
on turn it on and that it's no longer

727
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:50,930
opportunistic but it's enforced

728
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:54,230
encryption actually has accomplished

729
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:56,839
more or less for HTTPS because of the

730
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,280
it's I mean it's a lot of people hate it

731
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,390
because it's used for finger-pointing

732
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:05,150
but also true but I think seen as a

733
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,650
whole it helps to raise the bar and like

734
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,930
you said once the bar is raised high

735
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:11,750
enough we can start to disable stuff

736
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:16,790
that's no longer beautiful so yeah it's

737
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:20,690
definitely the goal now maybe for one

738
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:23,300
more question if you have it if not deny

739
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,700
you would like to thank you for the

740
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,270
presentation Martine if you around

741
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,270
applause please

742
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,500
very very cool project
