1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,219
all right so for the last part like I

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,900
said at the beginning if you missed one

3
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:13,030
of the talks but you were really

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,370
interested in it but you went to the

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,110
workshop instead or you just missed it

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,948
because you were doing Holloway Kong

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:23,050
which is probably fine then now that -

8
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:25,240
one last chance that you can ask

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,130
questions from the presenters they will

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,320
summarise what they were talking about

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,948
what were the main questions during the

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,380
during their talk what were the

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,450
discussion focus down mostly I said

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,930
we're gonna go in chronological order as

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:45,430
they were but it's kind of a lot of time

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,379
to do that and also by me who are the

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:53,170
speakers and also some of our speakers

18
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:56,649
had to leave so and afterwards you can

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,809
just come as as you as you wish some of

20
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:01,030
them will have presentations in slide

21
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,910
format some of them will just come up

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:07,990
and do a talk so ya know let's start

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:11,340
with you hello everyone I did make a

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,820
talk about how to build awareness by

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,950
employee

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,259
one of the things that I said that we

27
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,990
need to do it at work because private no

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,930
one's want to look it's also most of the

29
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,060
time to complicate to death so they are

30
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,920
not interesting or they lose interesting

31
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,770
about after two minutes of looking about

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,780
that so if you go to work they need to

33
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,710
know that companies also most of the

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,689
time more better touch touch it and then

35
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,149
sell because of the company or at

36
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:43,210
hospital there are lot of people who

37
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,909
work there there are clients or patients

38
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,850
so that's the reason the criminal will

39
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:52,240
go earlier to the hospital and then look

40
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:57,759
one by one person the training was more

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:01,630
instruction for ICT or IT department or

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,880
security department three steps three

43
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,460
goals in a free in the first two steps

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,359
you make them interesting if I make them

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:13,239
interesting and willing to learn is to

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,540
show them for you in the West Europe we

47
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:20,379
also have outside of our company

48
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,659
the link with my work where all our data

49
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:25,179
when they talk to the colleagues or to

50
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:28,390
some people they were all always like

51
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,390
what they never thought about that and

52
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,849
they were like oh yes yes that is true

53
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,700
so that way you make them really

54
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,970
interesting to hear it then the second

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,159
part of the training you try to explain

56
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,340
the button happened with their data and

57
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:48,670
then how you will make it a lot to the

58
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,680
security department because they know

59
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,839
the audience and every company's a

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,690
little bit different so they can make

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,599
their training based on that and the

62
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,730
third part is a workshop in that part

63
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,510
you can make different groups and work

64
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,250
with the people where y8l that workshop

65
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,959
because you make contact with people

66
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,629
they know who you are

67
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:15,060
they saw you it's not just some name or

68
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:17,620
some imaginary not from the IT

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,750
department so they will know who you are

70
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,410
and they can ask you what they don't

71
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:26,799
understand they can ask you another tip

72
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,750
what I said is that keep simple so don't

73
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,060
go too much there because they don't

74
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,060
understand so you will lose them in two

75
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,010
minutes they are afraid that they need

76
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,650
to know everything what you explained to

77
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,198
them they think I must know that so they

78
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,919
will stop thinking and never say I will

79
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:48,579
never learned that so I quit so keep it

80
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:52,180
simple and if someone wants to know more

81
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:54,910
they will ask you so look your audience

82
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,069
with who you talk and go with that and

83
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,500
if you want to explain something more

84
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:03,698
ask them do you want to know something

85
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:06,250
more okay then you go further so in that

86
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:09,579
time you can go and talk about different

87
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:12,549
topics with them that are important for

88
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:16,810
the company or Hospital where you are

89
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:19,090
and that after my talk we had a nice

90
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,680
discussion and I was really surprised

91
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:25,179
and thank you that you did make it

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:29,250
Dave David because I did hear a lot of

93
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,400
nice ideas somewhere we are more like

94
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,100
talking

95
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,250
the people but somewhere we'll were also

96
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,410
about the rules and also I did say that

97
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,470
the rules when they made people

98
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,130
understand why they need to protect them

99
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:48,490
then then they will accept all the rules

100
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,530
without questioning so much because they

101
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,900
say minik when you come to the hospital

102
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,448
and when you are sick and you don't feel

103
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,210
good you follow orders of the nurse or

104
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:00,759
for the doctor you don't ask why and

105
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,770
explain when you don't feel good you

106
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,260
follow them and then sometimes you ask

107
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,979
how what but most of the time most

108
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,620
people just follow the rules of all of

109
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:14,199
the instruction of the nurse same way

110
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,070
you can instruct another people who are

111
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:23,590
not that tech like you a few idiots that

112
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:30,849
I did like where like someone said then

113
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:33,698
if some people are bad maybe if some

114
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:37,210
people are bad like they did try to be

115
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,940
bad bad bad but guy it was really simple

116
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,400
when they make problems after that you

117
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,800
train them and after you explain them

118
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,380
then you talk one or two times and then

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,630
sorry you get fired because the company

120
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:54,729
if you make your mistake because you

121
00:05:49,630 --> 00:06:00,849
don't care company will pay the how you

122
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:02,740
call it but yes that or you will have a

123
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:05,590
company will self problem because if

124
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,270
someone break the chair or break things

125
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,560
in a company you can do it one time

126
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:14,229
second time you're fired

127
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,780
another idea where like also talking

128
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:18,789
about your family so people who have a

129
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,888
children or family they will like also

130
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,770
to protect themselves so you can mix

131
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:26,500
both of them also some kind of

132
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,320
gamification that you can see and try

133
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,539
people to hack each other but it has one

134
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,669
time is was like go to Google and search

135
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,630
about each other information and see

136
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:38,520
what you can find

137
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,779
and some people are most of the time

138
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,330
surprised what they can find about

139
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,139
another overawed can be find about

140
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:50,490
themselves

141
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:54,340
Internet some of them like in Mid East

142
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,479
Maxim said it was like if you make some

143
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:01,359
mistake okay

144
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:03,340
the your account is locked so okay okay

145
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,129
but that was that was pretty good

146
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,698
summary anyone has a question to you

147
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:11,139
know for the audience okay great so

148
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,379
thank you

149
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:19,560
up next Remi can you please sum up your

150
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:22,509
presentation so hello my talk was about

151
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,419
ending my wave and he was seen with a

152
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,969
chatbot so I start the project by

153
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:31,750
instead in some money put everywhere in

154
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:35,699
Internet and I stopped by a catching my

155
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:41,139
way my thanks my to my own efforts and

156
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:43,150
it was going to follow all the the log

157
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,719
of the report and given Oldham our way

158
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,659
so I wanted to autumn eyes this boring

159
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:52,449
task and for this user

160
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:55,259
haha - so it's a given engineering

161
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:57,849
platform really very powerful

162
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,669
come on details you want to start

163
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:04,750
analyzing somewhere and you can make

164
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:07,359
exploit with that and so yeah it's

165
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,990
really nice and I use a Python script

166
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,330
you can use you can script you can make

167
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:17,159
script with Python with Radha there is a

168
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:21,250
plugin for what it's called x.25 and so

169
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:23,889
the good of this crowd is to reverse the

170
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,839
malware and give you I have the

171
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:28,089
communion control of the malware most of

172
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,149
time to commen control was cryptic

173
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:34,059
encrypted inside them our way and after

174
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:37,149
that launch always the same script can

175
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:40,739
be becomes boring so I choose another

176
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:44,320
way to move to Matthias supports s so

177
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,079
like a little people Muslim last time my

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,990
place to talk with my friend on the chat

179
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:53,560
internet shut and we used telegram so I

180
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:56,000
find the but cool but and it's this bot

181
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,609
is compatible with a lot of

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,490
chat protocol like telegram is eep eep

183
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:06,980
eep hot and slack whatever and we don't

184
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:13,280
create a baton telegram and use this but

185
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:16,190
to control with Adjani but but readers

186
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,880
all the website catch all the malware

187
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,520
confirm the drop site to my honey pot

188
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,360
and aggregate all the log into the

189
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:29,360
website and you can follow the the new

190
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,390
sample or when it's coming into the into

191
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,180
the telegram chat and you can reverse

192
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:38,630
directly the malware from the telegram

193
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,729
shut so yeah it's quite useful and you

194
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:45,980
can make some reversing very powerful

195
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,510
and we quickly and no money to to make a

196
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,660
reverse thing you need a laptop in

197
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,670
circuits not there is not a good one why

198
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,850
is it not only one you can make it a

199
00:09:52,670 --> 00:10:00,229
thing with your phone so that's pretty

200
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:03,860
cool so so yeah I receive a lot of

201
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:07,220
feedback but my but and some people

202
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,610
could find things besides good so I'm

203
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,950
happy to - no - no but yeah it's all for

204
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:26,540
my side so I don't know if you have some

205
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:32,930
questions okay next Klaus for example

206
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:36,980
can come so what about small to medium

207
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:42,229
business security I worked for some

208
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:44,890
years for a small bank trying to build

209
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:49,580
security starting from very little and

210
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:51,530
then slowly over years moving up and I

211
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,089
talked about the reasons doing security

212
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,680
for small companies is hard because they

213
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:58,220
don't have skills at of time they don't

214
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,819
have the people we didn't moved on to a

215
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,150
security framework that I built with

216
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:07,250
more than 200 controls that any small to

217
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,189
medium business can implement if only

218
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,380
they have say one IT

219
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,600
as in which of course some don't but

220
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,600
these controls can't be implemented

221
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,860
without much in the way of budgets much

222
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,230
in the way of skills and much in the way

223
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,710
of time it's efficient it's something

224
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:27,640
that every ISM be can do so I put that

225
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:31,450
out on the internet and the goal then is

226
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,330
for SMBs to find it and for the

227
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,580
community to tell the sambisa about it

228
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,170
because all it takes for one SMB to

229
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,780
start improving their level of security

230
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,920
is one security champion within the

231
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,780
company it doesn't need to be an IT

232
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,729
doesn't need to be in security just one

233
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,810
champion wants to make a change and make

234
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,930
things better and they can start

235
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,420
improving and then we talked about how

236
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,060
once you have started doing security in

237
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,040
SMB you actually have strategic and

238
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,510
tactical advantages over big companies

239
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,719
because you're flexible and adaptable

240
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,220
and you can make quick decisions that

241
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,010
was my talk we also had a lot of

242
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,010
discussion afterwards on different ideas

243
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:18,970
are you gonna put the slides on the

244
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:21,040
website I'll send you the slides right

245
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,780
you can find this nights on the B sides

246
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,730
website you can also find the framework

247
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,800
called Minimum Viable security by

248
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,740
searching online or going to peer list

249
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,109
and searching our peer list is on P list

250
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,600
so there is and I hope you will help

251
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,570
spread the word because as we discussed

252
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,030
in the comments after the talk as some

253
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,550
PS that do get hit either with a breach

254
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,290
or with ransomware they often go out of

255
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,770
business especially if they're really

256
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,569
small

257
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,319
it really hurts them hard to get hacked

258
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,920
qui encrypted so they need this any

259
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,920
questions

260
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:18,350
yes sure one control that I find really

261
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:22,400
really useful is to use either a met or

262
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:25,880
Malwarebytes anti-tech sploit it's

263
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,490
rather simple for Amit you will need to

264
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,820
create various profiles based on what

265
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,770
users do in the jobs because it has

266
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,020
certain crashes here and there but these

267
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:45,230
two tools just block so much attack

268
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:46,720
surface for you email is Amit is not

269
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,800
going to be end-of-life Amit is

270
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,800
incorporated into Windows 10 which no

271
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,810
one has anyway and it still works fine

272
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:11,359
for Windows 7 which people have so don't

273
00:13:53,810 --> 00:14:14,349
worry yeah but you want to pay the small

274
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,820
fee that it is for the administration

275
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:20,140
console so you can manage it centrally

276
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:29,960
it's not expensive

277
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:31,310
that was my talking next up so there was

278
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,840
there was one question wait wait wait

279
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,020
you're running away there was one

280
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,020
question

281
00:14:52,690 --> 00:15:01,070
no license terms I would say then it's

282
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:03,469
BSD no because that's the that's the

283
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,560
most widest I get no if I'm not mistaken

284
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:13,180
that's BSD license

285
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:20,000
okay cool thanks again okay yeah yeah

286
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:20,870
you're ready apostle's okay thank you hi

287
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,820
everyone again

288
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:28,070
so more technically it was about an

289
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:32,060
attack that is common in object-oriented

290
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:35,020
languages either it's Java Python dotnet

291
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,119
it's called deserialization i'm

292
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,520
demonstrated the attack i demonstrated

293
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,430
the popularity of the attack it's used

294
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,660
in many other protocols the

295
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,109
serialization is used in many protocols

296
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,939
it's used by countless of vendors and

297
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,610
every vendor that try to use that

298
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,460
protocol digitalization Predacon failed

299
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:58,610
because there are some secrets of the

300
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,650
serialization process that they were not

301
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,340
aware of they became public very

302
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:06,770
recently like a few years ago two years

303
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,460
ago and suddenly all this way all these

304
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:12,410
vendors were found to be vulnerable and

305
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,510
it's a very reliable attack easy to

306
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,329
exploit and it affects all software

307
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:19,580
layers not just the application layer

308
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,740
frameworks libraries application servers

309
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:27,590
even the Java platform itself the

310
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:30,500
runtime so for example Oracle released

311
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,800
an update for the Java platform two days

312
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,780
ago

313
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,849
it contains four vulnerabilities in

314
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,880
serialization three years three months

315
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,070
ago another four vulnerabilities in the

316
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,660
Java platform it's also in the new OS

317
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:47,270
top ten that will be released tomorrow

318
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,459
absolutely so this is real quick the

319
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,850
process UCLA's an object that lives in

320
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:54,110
memory and you dis realize it back again

321
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,290
to another computer that this

322
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,930
realization process is the problematic

323
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,890
how to solve the problem stop using the

324
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,410
serialization

325
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,129
stop using the technique however it's

326
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,589
not

327
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,390
you do not control all layers or that of

328
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,540
software that ran on your platform or

329
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,320
even legacy you don't control that so

330
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,139
you have to putz

331
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:19,290
however putzing it was obvious that from

332
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,440
many talks here today passing can break

333
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:24,510
your application the Oracle update that

334
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,070
was released two days ago it's not

335
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,290
backwards compatible so you want to

336
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:30,000
solve your problem your vulnerabilities

337
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,550
but it might break your application so

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,700
it's not easy to putz so how do you stop

339
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:38,430
the vulnerability you can use any of

340
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:42,090
these three approaches and what I what I

341
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:44,070
did in my presentation is I highlighted

342
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,189
the limitations of every one of these

343
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,020
approaches the first to actually the

344
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,120
security manager is broken can be

345
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,620
bypassed it has been bypassed is not

346
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:59,520
reliable and then what what's left

347
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:01,350
actually let me show you what's left its

348
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,389
you have to do filtering some kind of

349
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,580
filtering like what is blacklist you

350
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,650
have to allow specific classes to be

351
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,199
visualized or specific class is not to

352
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,570
be digitalized but this is this is not

353
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,540
easy it doesn't scale it's not in the

354
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,439
price scale it's human it requires human

355
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,470
intervention

356
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,050
it's error-prone and it doesn't protect

357
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:26,160
you yeah that's fine

358
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,840
and then I I discussed about the

359
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,390
instrumentation agents which is a very

360
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,810
popular way to perform filtering but

361
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,190
they have a fundamental problem

362
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,139
instrumentation agents live in the same

363
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,690
address space as the application and

364
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:44,600
this means if the application is

365
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:47,670
compromised the agent is compromised so

366
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,379
they're not reliable they shouldn't be

367
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,060
used in my opinion that are

368
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,660
inappropriate for cloud environments

369
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:58,169
every business shifts to the cloud so

370
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,400
they have this problem so there isn't a

371
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,880
different solution I propose a different

372
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,680
solution using virtualization let's

373
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,100
visualize the time--time platform itself

374
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,740
and by doing that we move the security

375
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,050
controls from the application space to

376
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,790
the hypervisor and when the security

377
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,669
control is outside of the application

378
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,530
space no matter what

379
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,960
creation vulnerability exists it cannot

380
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,810
affect the security control anymore so

381
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,150
so your security controls that module is

382
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:30,750
a component that makes you secure is

383
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,210
secure is isolated it's in the

384
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:36,360
privileged space that cannot be touched

385
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:39,470
by the application and then I introduced

386
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,189
this technique the micro

387
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,710
compartmentalization on privilege

388
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,710
escalation that minimizes the privileges

389
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:49,260
during this utilization so it avoids

390
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,340
this privilege escalation and API abuse

391
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,840
that is the effect of the

392
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:57,990
deserialization attack so that was my

393
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,610
talk key takeaways in my opinion you

394
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,360
shouldn't be using intimidation agents

395
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,479
for security

396
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,780
the instrumentation API wasn't designed

397
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,760
for that and you should think about

398
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,970
other alternatives there are the reason

399
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,610
technology right now that these high

400
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,550
high end technology we keep investing

401
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,419
it's called with ASP runtimes

402
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:21,780
self-protection application self

403
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:25,980
protection you should Google about it

404
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:28,860
and learn more about it that was the end

405
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:35,400
of my talk and then we had a few

406
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:40,620
questions one about wops i think from a

407
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:43,290
very clever guy so web application

408
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,370
firewalls web application firewalls can

409
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:50,159
they mitigate this attack well I

410
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,879
wouldn't say so they can mitigate it up

411
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,560
to a point

412
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,150
yeah just thinking that argument web

413
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,129
application firewalls have to do again

414
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,750
filtering blacklist and what listening

415
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,880
and it's even worse because they have to

416
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,040
do it outside of the context of the

417
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,630
application so they see the stream the

418
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,430
input that comes to the application and

419
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,620
they have to make a decision should I

420
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,390
should I allow the requesters not and

421
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,310
it's it's a silly way of doing it they

422
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:17,100
depend on signatures and pattern

423
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,020
matching this is a this is a way for

424
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,469
example to fool a Web Application

425
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,600
Firewall you create a stream as easy as

426
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,550
that and they they think this is an

427
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,770
attack which obviously this is benign

428
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,020
doesn't do any harm but you can fool

429
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,330
them real easy so you have fall

430
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,860
positive seen in public use and

431
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,840
firewalls and you depend on signatures

432
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,820
if the update your signatures again

433
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:53,550
again is not future proof that was my

434
00:21:40,820 --> 00:22:09,540
thank you any questions next is going be

435
00:21:53,550 --> 00:22:12,960
DD hello I'm DJ work for her and visa

436
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:16,290
and we did a workshop on militias of his

437
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,080
documents so why talk I do a workshop

438
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:21,060
about militias office documents well

439
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,379
it's because we're talking about malware

440
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:29,700
and malware is often executables a

441
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,530
Windows executables but the autos

442
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,800
malware autos they want to deliver it

443
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:36,750
and you know delivering executables via

444
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,230
email in a lot of organizations no

445
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,070
longer works a PE file and executable

446
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,230
you cannot mail it

447
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,790
even with Gmail if you try to put it in

448
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,640
a zip file it will recognize it and

449
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:50,220
block it okay so that in most of the

450
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,980
cases that no longer works so what they

451
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,010
are doing now for several years now is

452
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,400
putting the malware into documents like

453
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,740
office documents of PDF files and that's

454
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,560
what we did in workshop and we learned

455
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,620
how to recognize such files and how to

456
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,409
analyze what they do statically so that

457
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,260
was a workshop now why did I talk about

458
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:15,030
that because I make open source tools to

459
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,640
analyze such documents and for example

460
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:20,370
office documents that you don't need

461
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,560
microsoft office to be able to analyze

462
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,080
such documents but for example that you

463
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,030
can just use python on any operating

464
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,669
system that runs Buyten and then you can

465
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:32,000
use my tools to analyze such documents

466
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:37,560
and that is what we in the workshop

467
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,710
there were three types of exercises so I

468
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:43,950
brought about 30 different exercises

469
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,400
that step-by-step will introduce you

470
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,920
into

471
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,620
file format of office and how to analyze

472
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:53,550
such files and extract the malicious

473
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:56,340
code with my tools and many attendees of

474
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,290
the workshop didn't then you had also a

475
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,560
couple of people who had brought the

476
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:04,850
whole malware because that was the topic

477
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,860
of the workshop bring your whole malware

478
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:10,530
example with my tools an attendee was

479
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,620
able to analyze one malicious document

480
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:16,100
that he received recently it was a doc

481
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:19,260
files or a word document which contains

482
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:22,649
Marcos VBA macros and it contains a lot

483
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,960
of levels of indirection because you

484
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:29,060
have the VBA macros there inside you

485
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,340
have something base64 and base64 encoded

486
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:35,580
that turned out to be PowerShell which

487
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,990
was in turn also office kated it was the

488
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,000
obfuscated we had another layer of

489
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,630
PowerShell and that PowerShell was a

490
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,010
download

491
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,910
I would download something from the

492
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:47,700
internet trotty to disk and execute it

493
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:52,950
another sample that was brought somebody

494
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:56,400
was a an RTF file a rich text format

495
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,680
file and we were able to see in detail

496
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,770
it was an RTF file and it contained

497
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,180
JavaScript which looked malicious so

498
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,220
that was already quickly established

499
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:09,930
that we were dealing something with

500
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:12,330
something malicious and then we had to

501
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,910
the office gate to JavaScript but that

502
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,129
was not something we could do by the end

503
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:20,670
of the workshop so that's something that

504
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:23,970
has to be continued and then the third

505
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:26,100
thing that I brought for people who did

506
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,630
not bring the whole malware and who were

507
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,230
not really interested in the simple

508
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:34,500
exercises a bit of a proof of concept

509
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:38,790
maybe if you heard about it about two

510
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:41,970
weeks ago a new type of attack with dde

511
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:44,670
and dynamic data exchange now it's not

512
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,680
new it's an old technology but it has

513
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,890
been used again

514
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:53,040
so a dde dynamic data exchange one of

515
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:56,070
the features of this technology allows

516
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,149
you to execute code without having to

517
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:01,500
use Marcos

518
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:04,350
so and I bought two examples of this if

519
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,520
you want more information you I posted a

520
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:10,070
blog post about it

521
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:13,230
and here is an example of the analysis

522
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:17,250
with the Java file you analyze the

523
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:20,160
document and here you can see what is

524
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,230
launched you see that calculator is

525
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:30,059
launched so you know it's a proof of

526
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:32,610
concept and then also see Cal XE on

527
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:39,270
Windows 10 you actually no longer have

528
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:43,219
calc XE it has become a so that was a

529
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:45,929
workshop work to do some exercises and

530
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:51,570
successfully verse one malware that was

531
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:58,980
brought thank you any questions thank

532
00:26:51,570 --> 00:27:02,928
you thank you to continue with the

533
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,929
summaries George can you come please

534
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:19,020
okay but if you have to mess with your

535
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:24,840
resolution again then you have to just

536
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:29,879
go without the Prezi Mac's notoriously

537
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:45,980
bad with resolution and projectors nice

538
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:49,730
nice he learns okay so my talk was about

539
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:54,270
how you can use a partner to immunize

540
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:56,550
web services to their own unknown and

541
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,429
known vulnerabilities may be inferred

542
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:02,760
parties may be in your application

543
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:06,150
itself by basically defining a profile

544
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,340
for them that means like a set of system

545
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:11,940
calls that they can do

546
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:16,289
and I brought kind of like a case study

547
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,690
let's say off off an incident response

548
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:19,158
sorry I probably should have moved from

549
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:24,720
here

550
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:27,809
so we're basically we were using ffmpeg

551
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,610
to convert some video files and a bug

552
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:31,678
bounty researcher found a vulnerability

553
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:35,479
in that particular version of that fan

554
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:41,340
back and actually the quick solution was

555
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:44,070
for us then to confine ffmpeg with at

556
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:47,070
Parmer instead of immediately patching

557
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:49,379
it of course later when we we patched it

558
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,990
and we came up with with an up-armored

559
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:55,049
profile which basically successfully

560
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:59,340
mitigated the attack which could have

561
00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:02,549
been exploited to read some local files

562
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,070
arbitrary local files on the on the EC

563
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:13,559
tools that were running this service I

564
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:15,960
think one of the it would take tons

565
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,030
of time now because I I already removed

566
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,559
this IP from the security group and

567
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:27,090
stuff - oh yeah but but actually no no

568
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:29,220
sorry but you could just for those who

569
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,889
were in here like I did the demo of the

570
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,679
exploitation itself and it was basically

571
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:37,830
a video converted by a fan pack that

572
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:43,500
contained the contents of the extra

573
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:45,780
password file as a demonstration anyhow

574
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,809
we we came up with this profile and I

575
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:52,020
think there was a really good point made

576
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:56,549
here that the mitigation did not only

577
00:29:52,020 --> 00:30:00,570
depend on on a primer itself but on the

578
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:03,809
facts as well that these files were not

579
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,879
easily guessable so this is why he could

580
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:07,200
not steal with someone else's uploaded

581
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,450
video fine and I think there's a really

582
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,789
good point that a partner doesn't speak

583
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,980
on that level right that's the so early

584
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:17,158
application level who uploaded that

585
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,190
video file to to our system a farmer

586
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,690
only speaks system calls and files and

587
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:25,620
and socket

588
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,970
and stuff like that so I think that was

589
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,110
that was kind of a pretty good point

590
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:33,990
that that we we also got a bit lucky

591
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:40,918
there that we already had that's that

592
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:43,259
part good then I talked a bit about how

593
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,649
this could be taken further not only

594
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:48,629
confining ffmpeg but the entire web

595
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:52,320
service itself since that's already

596
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:54,120
you're a tech interface normally sir

597
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,460
that could be vulnerabilities anywhere

598
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:02,518
else and then I try to show what kind of

599
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,909
tooling we built around monitoring this

600
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:12,539
whole thing and making it more usable

601
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:15,779
more visible and just just easier to use

602
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:20,250
and manage for for us and for the

603
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:25,490
developers as well and I think this was

604
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:28,379
kind of one of the key messages that a

605
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,320
primer is it's a good tool and you can

606
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:34,439
use it to to confine your web services

607
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,600
but it's only as good as your profiles

608
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,159
it's definitely something that you have

609
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,019
to maintain and you have to continuously

610
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:45,149
care about and you need all this kind of

611
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:47,549
tooling around it and of course and this

612
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:50,639
is the question we do not have a good

613
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:54,149
answer for and I would be really happy

614
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:56,399
to talk with anybody if if you have some

615
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:59,189
input on that so the question is how

616
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,739
does it scale I mean we already do this

617
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,809
for for a couple of processes but we

618
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,870
have no idea how even with all this

619
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:09,299
tooling all this monitoring around it

620
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:12,658
how does it scale massively with a lot

621
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:14,399
of a lot of services but we are kind of

622
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,990
already on the path to figure it out but

623
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,129
if anybody has some input on that then

624
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:28,769
that would be awesome

625
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:29,869
so that was my yeah any questions thank

626
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:36,169
you

627
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:40,488
Schama can you come next hi my name is

628
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:44,210
Tamara thea we have a workshop about

629
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:48,739
data forensic and in response the topic

630
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:52,849
was reindeer owned AVT x-files which you

631
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:56,179
know is the Microsoft security event in

632
00:32:52,849 --> 00:33:00,649
which I I presented a tour I wrote some

633
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:04,070
months ago that will let you choose to

634
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:06,468
save a lot of time during the incident

635
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:10,570
response handling and the forensic

636
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:13,669
analysis the tool itself will let you to

637
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:16,609
visualize all the relations between the

638
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:19,839
users computers and domains which user

639
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:23,228
is loading into a given computer at a

640
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:26,719
given date time

641
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:32,809
finally we we have been discussing about

642
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:36,499
another tool focus on how to create some

643
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:41,239
kind of a oxi IOC's or general rules in

644
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:46,399
the same event event files I think we we

645
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:49,159
all enjoyed the workshop I really really

646
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,399
proud to be here and if there is any

647
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:56,179
questions let me know

648
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:58,238
so that's all thank you very much thank

649
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:58,239
you

650
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:09,409
George can come next yes I can I'll just

651
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:11,089
keep it short because one of the last

652
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:16,220
and I mean between the weekend and you

653
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:18,739
guys so we talked about si P and how

654
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:20,388
hard it is to patch a CP systems and how

655
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:23,209
much work it is because it's all needs

656
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:26,299
to be done manually so I introduced like

657
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,569
some tooling that we used and developed

658
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:31,129
with a customer to automate things and

659
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:34,940
apply patches more in a more automated

660
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:38,389
which saves money time and you can raise

661
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:41,119
the the frequency of applying patches

662
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:41,870
and we had a short discussion afterwards

663
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,280
and I got

664
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:48,710
good feedback that's it in short I don't

665
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,270
want to make it any longer if there's

666
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:58,940
any questions feel free to shout

667
00:34:52,270 --> 00:35:01,370
otherwise thank you and last but not

668
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:26,590
least you're gonna have doing slides or

669
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:30,049
okay so I know so my talk was about the

670
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:34,400
HTTP implementations we had to look

671
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:38,810
about the different headers like I will

672
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,760
not explain all of them but it's just

673
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:42,770
yes it's a very interesting header to

674
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,220
force the browser east or west connect

675
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:49,610
to your website in HTTPS we had a look

676
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:53,060
about the risk and threats about HTTP

677
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:56,420
connections and web sites then we other

678
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:59,210
also look about other centers like HP KP

679
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:04,880
which is quite questionable if you want

680
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:08,510
lament or not USD 300s be stopping so

681
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,270
the new browsers needs to connect enter

682
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:14,330
to verify the validity of the server

683
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:18,290
certificates and also OCSP stapling is

684
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:22,370
able to speed the process and another

685
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:26,180
interesting not related to HTTP to DNS

686
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:27,920
the NSCA which is why listing the

687
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:32,330
certification authority that are

688
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:38,710
authorized to generate certificate for

689
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:38,710
your domain any question

690
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,339
okay thank you

691
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,340
we show good weekends
