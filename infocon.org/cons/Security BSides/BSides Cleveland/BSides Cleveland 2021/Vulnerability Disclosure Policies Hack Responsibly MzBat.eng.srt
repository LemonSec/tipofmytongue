00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
with me like if you know what it is

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,119

the same page everyone's good great

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,079
so the first time i fell through the

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,920
roof at a data center

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,600
um i broke one rib and cracked another

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,399
rib

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
um because i thought that the ceiling

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
in the data center would be sturdier

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
than it was uh but it was not okay

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160
next slide um

57
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,599
okay yes

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
yeah yeah that was and also

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,519
they paid my medical expenses um and i

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,400
actually like

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
broke my computer when i fell so i got a

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,599
new computer that was good because it

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,280
was government and mine was already like

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
five years old anyway

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
yeah no it was a it was for sure a work

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,879
injury

67
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
um yeah super fun uh okay so

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,879
next slide um you know who needs a vdp

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,239
so uh one time i cried my way into a

70
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
multi-million dollar data center because

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
i pretended to be a drunk goth girl at

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,959
like three in the morning

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
and that particular

74
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
time yes i was pretending because i need

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,640
to be on my game right because i thought

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,080
i'm gonna have to cry my way into the

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,599
data well i didn't really have a plan

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,360
for how i'd get in there but i thought

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,959
okay let's try this thing i haven't

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,239
tried before which is playing on

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,599
people's sympathies

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,799
um because i just kind of accepted after

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,159
recon i wouldn't be able to break into

84
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,519
the building because it was

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
this special really secure building in

86
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,599

87
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,879
visited before so um

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,000
so i was like crying smeared makeup

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,720
gots boots like half undone and i was

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,480
like oh my god

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,159
my boss is gonna kill me like i was

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,080
drunk at the club i took the cab here

93
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,560
but like one of our you know websites

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
went down

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
and i thought like okay and i'd stash

96
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,159
like pick kits and my

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,640
corset and i had like a car duplicator

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,879
all over but anyway he was so so nice

99
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,280
shout out to my man

100
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,439
at the place we won't talk about who

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
actually let me into the data center and

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
open the cage so i didn't even have to

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,599
use anything

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,280
um i had to just pull out my post-it

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,799
notes that had bats on them and stick

106
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,480
them on every server and like you got

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,959
popped

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,798
that's it i got rude like you're done

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
physical access means

110
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,960
like they're done um great next slide

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
um let's see oh one time

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
i ran burp on a production system

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,560
government uh they're pretty glad i've

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,919
gone to the private sector now

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,960
and uh destroyed about 25

116
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
of the production data on like this

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
particular server because i ran burpees

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,199
admin user

119
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,199
um because i logged out but didn't

120
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
realize that like my admin creds were

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,560
cached and

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,160
uh i thought i was doing good stuff and

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
drinking my coffee and it was awesome

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,360
and the dev ran over it's like oh my god

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
we got hacked like somebody's in the

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
system right now destroying

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,919
our database and i was like oh

128
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,199
damn packers and so

129
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,039
uh don't run burp suite

130
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
in production with an admin user on that

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,800
system

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,639
so there's a lesson for you uh

133
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,199

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,919
um oh i have a dave kennedy story

137
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,199
so the first time i ever went to derby

138
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,400
con

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,639
i'm very socially awkward and i'm really

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,320
shy and you wouldn't know it this just

141
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
comes from

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,680
two white claws and um zany's

143
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,880
so cool everyone um

144
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
so dave kennedy came up to me at derby

145
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
and was like oh my gosh

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
i've never seen you before cause i i

147
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
don't know i guess i

148
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,560
stood out and he was like are you having

149
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880

150
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,080
i i that one no i think i was just

151
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
probably dressed like a

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
handmaiden from handmade till or

153
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
something i was like pretty low-key at

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,080
that one

155
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,639
because i wasn't sure if like this

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,479
community was ready because i can be a

157
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,600
little extra

158
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160

he took me into the lockpick village and

173
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
he bought me a lockpick kit

174
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
and he sat with me while i picked my

175

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,919
some other people

178
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,199

dave kennedy that i'm at all in the

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
infosec community because before that

181
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,360
i was just hanging out at codemash uh

182
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520

183
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,199

this slide um

192
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
so if you have a vdp at your company

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,319
make sure you're asking for

194
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,120
proof of concept so that hackers can

195
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,319
tell you how they did it because they

196
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,000
really like to tell you how they did it

197
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,960
and like

198
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,360
that'll just make the submission better

199
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
all right so

200

202
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,440
bottom of this meme but then i thought

203
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
there were kids here so i didn't but you

204
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,080

205
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
yeah samuel l jackson i know yours don't

206
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,159
care but i was trying to be respectful

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,479
oh okay does anyone have a question

208
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,479

209
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
yes

211
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
okay okay yeah i mean

212
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,400
feel free it's sort of the topic

213
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
oh i totally have a slide about that

214
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,400
so i'm gonna blow you off now and like

215
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
we'll get to that slide and then we can

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,319
talk about it it also has a very cute

217
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,039
meme with it

218
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,719
so um cool let's see what other massive

219
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
failures have i made in my career oh

220
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
well i didn't understand how important

221
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,320
job titles are

222
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,719
um so anyone who tells you that job

223
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,440
titles

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,040
aren't important maybe possibly

225
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
might come from a community of privilege

226
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
where they just

227
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,640
don't know how important they are yes

228
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
questions

229
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,000
um so uh yeah early in my career

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
um i had an opportunity to kind of pick

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,440
my job title i was working at a startup

232
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
and um so i was just in ops

233
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,560
and we decided to pick like a formal

234
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,320
formal job titles for ourselves at this

235
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
startup because that's kind of what you

236
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,320
do to

237
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
get your investors to give you money uh

238
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,160
so i became a qa

239
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,600
engineer um but really what i was doing

240
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
was like sql injections and defacing web

241
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
forms and like

242
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,040
just effing s up

243
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,399
and um it took like i just did that for

244
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,880
years

245
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
and then um our startup got bought by

246
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,120
this company called the economist

247
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
and they brought in a a person who was a

248
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
cto which until that point

249
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,600
we just thought that was like a joke

250
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
title we didn't know it was like a real

251
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
job um and he came in he was like you

252
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,720
know

253
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
basically re-interviewed all of us for

254
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
our jobs and he was like what do you do

255
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,800
and i told him i described it he's like

256
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,000
oh

257
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,959
that's like overzealous pin testing like

258
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,040
you're not supposed to deface your like

259
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,160
production web forms i'm like

260
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
cool and he was like so you're a

261
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,760
security analyst and i was like

262
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,560
oh so that's where the discrepancy in

263
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,440
like when i was

264
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,959
first started doing security and then

265
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
later when i it got labeled

266
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,240
that but i came up when there was no

267
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,480
like degree in it or classes you could

268
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,760
take or

269
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,640
or whatever so um i did not come into

270
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,839
this

271
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,880
profession with certifications or

272
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,399
you know uh validation on my resume that

273
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,519
made any sense

274
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,040
okay next slide um

275
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
speaking of certifications they're

276
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,680
really expensive

277
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,040
um so let me tell you if you

278
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,640
i i don't think certifications

279
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,600
are um if you're a hiring manager in

280
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
here should be a requirement

281
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
because making them a requirement really

282
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
rejects the notion that they're really

283
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
expensive and the folks who tend to be

284
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,399
able to afford those kind of

285
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,839
certifications come from a place of

286
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,200
privilege so folks from

287
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
underrepresented communities in tech

288
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,399
aren't necessarily going to have the

289
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,360
opportunities to get those

290
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
certifications and so if you require

291
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
them or like ridiculous advanced degrees

292
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,360
um then you're gonna

293
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,000
inevitably have a cis white male

294
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,040
dominated

295
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,560
senior technical team and i can tell you

296
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
just my soap boxes i feel like diversity

297
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,079
makes

298
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,120
all of our communities better and so

299
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,120
uh that said i did get the gcih

300
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
and that other one

301
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,320
gisp which was like bootcamp for cissp

302
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
only because the government required it

303
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,519
and i couldn't afford it and the feds

304
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,200
have a low budget so

305
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,519
i look up the all you have to do look up

306
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,560
sans

307
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
has a facilitator program it's basically

308
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,320
a work study program and you get like a

309
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,720
7

310
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
000 training for like 1100 bucks you

311
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,720
just have to like fetch coffee sometimes

312
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,279
so

313
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,639
that's how you get the cert if you need

314
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,399
it while i want to say search aren't

315
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,279
necessary

316
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,600
uh they did open doors for me that

317
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,839
hadn't been previously opened

318
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,079
just by like validating that i knew what

319
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,680
i was doing so

320
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
i don't like on search i'm just

321
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
i'll you know reach out to me on twitter

322
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
i'll tell you like the cheap ways to get

323
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
them

324
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
um oh and all the places to like

325
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,839
download the free

326
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,399
unauthorized content if you want to just

327
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,480
pay the 400 bucks and take the test

328
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,079
um cool and there are ways to get around

329
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,680
the whole proctor thing too

330
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:53,839
i just hit me up yes

331
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,760
the certifications do so the comment is

332
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,040
the certifications

333
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
through sans those trainings even with

334
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
work study the price keeps going up

335
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,240
because i know the first one i did

336
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,079
as as a facilitator i only had to pay

337
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,000
700 bucks for like the training

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
and the cert attempt and then the second

339
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,399
one i did was 1100 so yeah that's been

340
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,079
years ago so maybe what are they like

341
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,719

343
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,959
how you can utilize

344
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,800
only fans to get certifications okay

345
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,519
um okay there's gotta be a better way

346
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,320
than like

347
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200

394
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,600
don't know

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,759
um okay let me think about another

400
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,959
massive failure oh

401
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,800
okay this is a good one so everyone use

402
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,399
raise your hand if you've ever heard of

403
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,560
slack okay who knows that slack has a

404
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,759
google

405
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,600
g-docs like integration feature oh

406
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,519
who knew that when you turn on that

407
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,360
integration it actually imports those

408
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,240
documents

409
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,759
into your slack instance oh one person

410
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,680
two people okay so let me tell you how i

411
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,800
found out i got a call from the

412
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
inspector general

413
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,839
because uh somebody had turned on a

414
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,399
slack

415
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,639
integration for g docs and a whole bunch

416
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,959
of like classified

417
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,759
 that people had posted links to got

418
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,240
like

419
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
put into the slack instance where there

420
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,680
were like

421
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,079
public vendors and shared channels had

422
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,519
access

423
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,040
so uh like we found remediated

424
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,759
pulled the logs like we're able to prove

425
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
like here's who accessed it like we

426
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,720
all that metadata by the way is uh

427
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,680
stored

428
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,759
in in well in g suite um

429
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,920
there's a there's a really cool um

430
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,800
company out there

431
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,880
startup called nera and what they'll do

432
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,639
is pull all the metadata from your g

433
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,880
drive and like make it searchable and

434
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
you can also do access control

435
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,320
see when the last time somebody opened

436
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,240
it if anybody's downloaded it

437
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
it tells you like if they type like

438
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:05,839
given

439
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,679
their personal account access to

440
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,959
that it shouldn't anyway

441
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,280
it's called nera you can look it up uh

442
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,319
they're they're new

443
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,760
um but uh that was horrible

444
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,439
so anyway but the point is it took us

445
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
about six hours to go through

446
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,039
pull all the logs do full remediation

447
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,439
show that no one had accessed these

448
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,319
classified documents that they couldn't

449
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,640
so i thought one and done i think i was

450
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
at b-sides las vegas

451
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,039
when i was doing ir on that one and um

452
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,240
the inspector

453
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,039
general got involved on the monday and

454
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,919
the investigation lasted 18 months

455
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,000
so check your slack settings and

456
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,320
don't let people turn on integrations

457
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
for g docs unless you really

458
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,000
understand what you're doing it warns

459
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you but i don't know

460
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
he just didn't read the eula i don't

461
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,360
know so

462
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,799
don't do that but i got in a lot of

463
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,520
trouble for that uh

464
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,440
because i was the one who advocated for

465
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,559
slack for

466
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,600
our government agency and

467
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,679
so anyway great timeline

468
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,559
there there's the answer that's what the

469
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,480
timeline means

470
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,000
time to fix time to school i'm supposed

471
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,880
to like talk but i just don't care

472
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
uh so you just agree on a timeline right

473
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,679
well i'll just answer your question 30

474
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,280
days 60 days how long are you going to

475
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,039
give the vendor to fix it before you're

476
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,480
allowed to disclose it publicly because

477
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
a lot of us likes to disclose stuff at

478
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,720
defcon

479
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,919
or black hat or wherever but you have to

480
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,320
have

481
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
a good relationship doing coordinated

482
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
disclosure with the vendor

483
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,240
and i'll i've got a slide later that

484
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
just gives you the

485
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
tldr when you disclose a bug at defcon

486
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,160
yeah i literally worked for a

487
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,760
government agency um that we

488
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,440
had a really like p1

489
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,200
actually probably say a po vulnerability

490
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
that was going to be disclosed at black

491
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,679
hat that we fixed about an hour before

492
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,240
the

493
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,320
guy went on stage it took us like three

494
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,600
months to fix it um

495
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,360
that will give you an ulcer uh

496
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,880
cool legal uh the elephant in the room

497
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,160
for disclosure who knows a prize to the

498
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,840
person who knows i don't really have any

499
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,400
prizes

500
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
i'll just be transparent cfa right it's

501
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160


502
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
we know it it's like too vague there are

503
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
some changes recently

504
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,039
cool but nah make sure you have

505
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,400
absolute permission to do what you're

506
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
doing or you're going to go to jail

507
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,799
um yeah if you don't have security at

508
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,720
your org.com or whatever

509
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,120
like go make that don't try to be cute

510
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
with like hot security or

511
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,880
good security just to just stick to the

512
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,080
basics

513
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,840
um or you can do a web form or a

514
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,919
platform web forms you can do like tls

515
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,360
encryption on your web form and then

516
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
the people can stay anonymous which i

517
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
like to stay anonymous usually when i

518
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,320
report bugs

519
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,600
uh i'm not a bounty hunter uh

520
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,840
yes

521
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,840
encrypted chat apps for

522
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,280
i have trust issues so probably i'm not

523
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,000
like the right

524
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,840
person to ask because i would say just

525
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,760
stick to their platform

526
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,120
or do it via encrypted web form

527
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,120
i just yeah right i mean you can tell me

528
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,080
your chat

529
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
app is encrypted but like show me the

530
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,080
pcaps so i know i don't know like i just

531
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,440
i don't trust anybody uh however

532
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
i do have instagram on my phone so

533
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,480
probably i'm not that

534
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,760
elite or whatever um cool so here's what

535
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

536
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,399
looks like great any questions

537
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,679
okay this is like boring government

538
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,600
stuff uh these are in here because i

539
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,559
gave this

540
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,919
i gave a training to the national guard

541
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,919
and i just had some graphics i again i

542
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,039
put this talk together

543
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,240
like two hours ago um cool

544
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,600
so doj has a framework for vdps

545
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
it's there i'm not gonna send you my

546
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,440
slides so it doesn't matter

547
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,559
uh 18f was the

548
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,080
digital services agency that i worked

549
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,200
for

550
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,480
that was housed in gsa and

551
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,919
we were all 30 rock fans so 18f

552
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,799
we named it that because it was at 1800

553
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,720
f street and we are nerds

554
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,799
so that is that uh

555
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,880
dod that was fun did anyone participate

556

598
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,960
like if you don't go back to your boss

budget

601
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
for a vdp you can go out and look for

602
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
like open source vdps

603
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
uh you can host them for free on hacker

604
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
one or bug crowd

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,120
or yourself on your website like there's

606
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
no reason not to have one

607
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,760
um but if you don't clearly have a place

608
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,520
for someone to report a vulnerability or

609
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,640
bug to you

610
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
