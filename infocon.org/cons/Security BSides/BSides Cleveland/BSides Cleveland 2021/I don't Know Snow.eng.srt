all right so my journey in to infosec so

94
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
it all started at def con

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,639
19. now this is the first year i went

96
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,440
when i went i just wanted to go to vegas

97
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,000
i had

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,160
no interest at all in going to a hacking

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,280
conference

100
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,840
um however i had a friend or a group of

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,039
friends that were going

102
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,520
and they got me a ticket and their badge

103
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
and they're like okay you gotta come at

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
least like

105
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720
check it out i was like nah like

106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
no like it's it kind of smells bad like

107
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,039
really bad and so

108
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,680
i sat in a couple talks and it all went

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,319
over my head

110
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,639
completely over my head i fell asleep in

111
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,560
the malware reversing talk

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,120
like it was bad so i got up at one point

113
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,960
i was like okay i have to

114
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
like find something entertaining so i

115
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,479
found the lock picking village and i

116
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,520
absolutely

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,840
loved it i walked in someone was like

118
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,039
hey have you ever picked a lock before

119
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,840
i'm like

120
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
no i've never picked a lock before and

121
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
they taught me everything

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,919
um and i got off handcuffs like it was

123
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,360
it was a blast

124
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,520
so when i left there i still had hours

125
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
to burn before the end of the day

126
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,560
and i found the social engineering

127
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
village and the doors were shut

128
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,240
so i go in there and i sit down and they

129
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
have live calls going on

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
so to kind of back things up i'm going

131
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
to explain how the social engineering

132
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
capture the flag works in case anyone

133
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
here is not familiar

134
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,759
so it's a competition where a group of

135
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,560
contestants

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
are given a target company normally it's

137
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,639
a fortune 500 company

138
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
so before they even get to defcon half

139
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,720
of the competition

140
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,800
is going out and finding flags against

141
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,759
our target company

142
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,280
through open source intelligence or

143
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
ocean gathering

144
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,800
and so they they go out they find the

145
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
flags and then the second part of the

146
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
competition is live

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
at defcon you're in a soundproof booth

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,199
in front of

149
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
a bunch of hackers making live phone

150
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
calls to their targets to try to elicit

151
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,680
these flags so anyways like i show up in

152
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
this room and someone's in the booth

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,599
making phone calls and it took me a

154
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,520
second to realize what was going on

155
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
but once i did i'm like oh man like this

156
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,039
was meant for me like this is

157
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
so cool like they're just talking to

158
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,240
strangers and getting information out of

159
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,720
them

160
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
like i could do this so i learned

161
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,400
everything i could

162
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,080
about social engineering i went home

163
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,240
that year i got all the books i could

164
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,280
find on

165
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,879
influence techniques and rapport

166
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,120
building and everything i could

167
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,840
and then the next year i signed up to

168
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,199
compete and you talk a little bit closer

169
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,520
to the mic

170
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,479
and so i so i went back i learned

171
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,520
everything and then

172
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
when the sign ups came around to do the

173
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
competition i was really excited i

174
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,280
signed up

175
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
then i found out i got accepted then i

176
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,319
did all my ocean

177
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,120
wrote my report then i'm on the plane to

178
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
defcon

179
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
i was terrified i remembered watching

180
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,000
that person

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,799
in that booth making those calls and

182
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,279
like my palms start sweating

183
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,920
like total like pre-panic attack like i

184
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,200
felt it coming on

185
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,440
because i went back and i was thinking i

186
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
have my comfort zone

187
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,360
right like i know what i'm good at but

188
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,680
this

189
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,320
is like way outside of it like

190
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,920
way outside of it

191
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,800
and i did not want to do it like i had

192
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,080
to hype myself

193
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,279
up so bad just to even like show up

194
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
into devcon and so like right before my

195
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
call like i was honestly thinking of

196
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,680
ways to fake my death

197
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,959
like i did not want to do this

198
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,440
and it was it was honestly like

199
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,240
incredibly terrifying for me

200
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,279
so i i do it i totally talk myself into

201
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,399
it and i do it

202
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,480
really really outside my comfort zone

203
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,839
and i did pretty well that year

204
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,839
i learned a lot did not win at all but i

205
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
learned a lot so

206
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,680
went back home realized i needed to

207
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,440
learn a lot more about

208
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,519
ocean right i taught myself a lot about

209
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,640
social engineering

210
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
now i needed to learn about ocean and

211
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
like the security side of things

212
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,240
right because when i was asking people

213
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,680
things like what kind of male client

214
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,720
they were using

215
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,680
i didn't understand the risk behind that

216
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
so i went home

217
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
taught myself about stuff went back the

218
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,399
next year right defcon 20.

219
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,640
or 21. same thing like i'm on the plane

220
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
like nervous as

221
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
but because i've done it before right

222
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,440
like it's

223
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
it's something that wasn't as scary

224
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,959
because i'd been in that position

225
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,839
because i got out of my comfort zone so

226
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,560
i show up

227
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,440
i get in the booth ring ring

228
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
more rings nobody answered any

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,519
of the calls

230
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,440
it was so like i just felt so defeated

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,800
and so when i went back that year i'm

232
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
like all right well you know i

233
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
did all that those two years of teaching

234
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,480
myself everything

235
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,519
um and it really really really sucked

236
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,079
in and so i wasn't going to do it the

237
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,320
next year i was like you know what

238
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
i learned what i could i'm done but i

239
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
saw

240
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,839
that they had the next year at def con

241
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,079
22 they were doing something different

242
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,240
they were doing team events so it would

243
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,200
be um

244
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
two people making the phone calls so i'm

245
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,279
like all right this is my last year i'm

246
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,800
just gonna do it this year and then i'm

247
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
done

248
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,760
and so i'm assigned my teammate and i

249
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
was really excited

250
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,519
to work with someone and you know we do

251
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,200
all of our ocean we write a report turn

252
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,920
it in

253
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
get to vegas and he ghosts

254
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,560
me so hard like would not text me back

255
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,000
so i'm like sitting there frantically

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
texting him like hey our call is

257
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
scheduled in 30 minutes where are you

258
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,560
like

259
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,880
horrified and so five minutes before

260
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,240
we're about to go on

261
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
he texts me like i'm way too hungover i

262
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
can't make it

263
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,680
so i'm like cool cool because you had to

264
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,800
have two people

265
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,720
luckily i found a volunteer and the

266
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
other thing was really good is i over

267
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,079
prepare way too much

268
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
and i created i printed copies of all of

269
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,120
our stuff

270
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
i created call scripts so pretty much

271
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
this person that that stood in

272
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
all they had to do was read from the

273
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,040
script and we kicked ass

274
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,480
like it was really really good and we

275
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,160
won that year so super super exciting

276
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,600
thank you but all because i got out my

277
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
comfort zone that first year right on

278
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
that plane i could have easily backed

279
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,120
out

280
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,040
and if you go to that competition you'll

281
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,959
see a lot of people just won't show up

282
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
just like my partner that year because

283
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
it's terrifying

284
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,440
so i look back at where i am today and

285
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,120
how it started like if i

286
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,160
would have just not done it like i

287
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,320
wouldn't be on the stage today

288
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,880
and so once we had one i had a lot of

289
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,440
people

290
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
like before the end of the conference

291
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
come up to me like wow you know you're

292
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
really good at this

293
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,959
can you come do some social engineering

294
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,639
tests for my company

295
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
and i was like oh like that's right

296
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,320
this is this is an actual career it's

297
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,800
not just a hobby for people

298
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,920
[Laughter]

299
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,680
and so i was really excited i went back

300
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,279
to my house afterwards and i decided to

301
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,639
reach out to two people in the industry

302
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,920
i was really excited to ask them you

303
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,399
know

304
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,959
how do i actually make this a career

305
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,160
right this is something i want to do

306
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,120
full-time

307
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
lying to people like give me money to a

308
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
lot of people yes please

309
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
and so the first person that i talked to

310
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,880
he said no one would ever hire a social

311
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
engineer

312
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,040
he said you have to be a pen tester or

313
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,560
do all these other things but

314
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,399
you will never get a career being a

315
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
social engineer

316
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,200
so it's like cool cool cool so i reached

317
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
out to someone else

318
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,040
and she told me i should become a

319
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,760
project manager

320
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
which again not even close to the same

321
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,480
yeah not even close to the same dodge

322
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,760
so i took a week and just was

323
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,240
i felt so defeated because i had spent

324
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
really three years

325
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,399
self-teaching myself everything that i

326
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,360
could about this

327
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
right i had people asking me to do this

328
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
for them like they wanted to give me

329
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,680
money

330
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,440
and i had two people that i had looked

331
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,880
up to told me

332
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,560
that i couldn't do it

333
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
so i spent a week just really honestly

334
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,320
depressed

335
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
but i'm also a very like vindictual

336
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
petty spiteful

337
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,440
salty as person and so i was like

338
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,240
you know what i'm gonna prove them wrong

339
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
and so what i did is i at that point i

340
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,079
started my own company i did a lot of

341
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,760
freelancing work and i reached out to

342
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,199
all those people at def con who wanted

343
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,800
me to do the work for them

344
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,399
and i started growing and i started

345
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,720
learning a lot a lot of stuff

346
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,440
and completely completely got out of my

347
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
comfort zone

348
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,320
and from there now today i've worked

349
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
i've owned my own business i've worked

350
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,680
at three companies i

351
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,839
freelanced through um and did white

352
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,279
labeling through tons of different

353
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,480
organizations

354
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
but i always think back to that moment

355
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
that i was on the plane heading to

356
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,959
defcon 20

357
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,079
for the first ctf at cctf and

358
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,880
just wanted to chicken out so badly like

359
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,639
it would have just been so easy

360
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,920
to like you know what guys you know i'm

361
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,839
good i'm backing out because a lot of

362
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,800
people do it

363
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,440
because it's terrifying but because i

364
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,279
got out my comfort zone

365
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,279
right that's that's where i am today so

366
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,480
i'm very

367
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
very excited i took those risks it was

368
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,000
extremely hard

369
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
now when it actually comes to testing

370
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,360
there are ways

371
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,600
that are also very terrifying um

372
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,040
especially when it comes to physical

373
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
security assessments

374
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
one of the ones where you could

375
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,079
definitely say i was outside my comfort

376
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,120
zone

377
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
this this one took or this was about

378
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
four years ago

379
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
and it was a client in downtown la

380
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
and the scope is really really simple

381
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,000
they wanted to one see if we could even

382
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
get into their location

383
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,839
right they had rfid they had guards they

384
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,279
had cameras they had they had everything

385
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
so can we even get in

386
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,720
the second thing is they wanted us to

387
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
plant usbs

388
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,079
around inside of their building to see

389
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,000
if employees would open them up

390
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
and then the third thing is they wanted

391
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,440
to see if we could actually

392
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
ask an employee to open it up like how

393
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
they would respond would they actually

394
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,399
do it

395
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,040
so i did all of my oscent um i did my

396
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,240
reconnaissance so

397
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,079
you know the day before i was in the

398
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,440
parking lot we were checking out the

399
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,399
building

400
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,199
we identified the door that most

401
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,000
employees

402
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,079
used to go in the morning right it

403
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,360
wasn't the main entrance it was a side

404
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,639
employee door

405
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,639
so the plan was to show up the next

406
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,560
morning and tailgate in

407
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,279
so we do that so i'm in my car i see a

408
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,399
lot of people heading

409
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,600
in to the building and i

410
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,440
follow behind now there was this lady

411
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,680
in front of me who just like everyone

412
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,279
else they didn't let the door slam

413
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,560
in front of the person behind them right

414
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
they were they were very nice

415
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,560
and she holds the door but she looks

416
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
behind and looks at me

417
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,120
and in those brief like two seconds i

418
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,839
saw in her

419
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,839
eyes that she knew she shouldn't have

420
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
been doing that

421
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,519
and that's something i see all the time

422
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,480
in physical security assessments she

423
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,560
was like oh i should i don't

424
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,000
recognize this person

425
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,880
but she also didn't know what to say

426
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,279
right

427
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,680
people don't want to be confrontational

428
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,120
or maybe she didn't even know how to

429
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,920
report me

430
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,600
she didn't know what to say so she still

431
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
let me in so i go in

432
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,759
and i start doing my usb drops i found a

433
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,759
mail room which is my favorite place to

434
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,279
do them because it actually has

435
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
you know people's names on mail slots so

436
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,040
i take a white envelope

437
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
i'll write the name on it put the usb in

438
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,639
there and put it in a ml slot and

439
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,399
they're so much more likely to be open

440
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,120
that way

441
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
so i'm going around dropping them off

442
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,199
i'm like okay i have to meet my last

443
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,720
objective i have to ask

444
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,919
someone to plug in the usb

445
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
so what i did is i left through the back

446
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,359
employee entrance and went into the

447
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,400
front door

448
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,520
and i was talking to the receptionist

449
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,720
absolutely the best place um to ask

450
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,679
someone to open it is through the

451
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,760
receptionist so i explained to her

452
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
hey i'm interviewing at the company next

453
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,959
door i completely

454
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,400
left my resume on my printer i am so

455
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,559
sorry can you please print it off for me

456
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,000
so as we're sitting there making small

457
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
talk and she's she's totally buying it

458
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,400
thank god

459
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,120
there are some people behind me talking

460
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,559
and so i start listening

461
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,440
and the guy the guy says ma'am can you

462
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,080
describe the intruder i'm like oh

463
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,240
 and so she starts describing me to

464
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,000
a t

465
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
right she's like she's wearing a blue

466
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,120
blazer and a white jacket and she's

467
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,960
short and white and chubby i'm just like

468
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
wow

469
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
okay like do we have to go that far so

470
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
completely describing me and i'm sitting

471
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,120
there i'm like oh man i am like so

472
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,080
burned right now

473
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,480
you know how people like the flight or

474
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,600
fight or flight

475
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,440
no fight or flight there we go yeah i do

476
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
the third option i freeze so i just

477
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,120
stood there like hoping the situation

478
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,880
would like just disappear

479
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,799
um so i'm talking the receptionist and

480
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,320
she's opening the usb

481
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,400
and i'm just like walking as awkwardly

482
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
as i can out of there like so they can't

483
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
like see my face and she doesn't

484
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
recognize me but

485
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,360
completely completely out of my comfort

486
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,160
zone

487
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,880
um lots of assessments especially in the

488
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,000
social engineering

489
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,400
engineering world will put you outside

490
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,520
of that

491
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,400
so progressing into my career i now

492
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,960
actually

493
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,880
am able to lead a team of other social

494
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
engineers which is really really

495
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
exciting for me especially going back to

496
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
that time when someone said

497
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,559
no one would ever hire just a social

498
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,360
engineer

499
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
but one of the things i strongly believe

500
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
in is leading from the front right i

501
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
wouldn't ask my team to do something

502
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
that i didn't feel comfortable doing so

503
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
i have a lot of people who are new to

504
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,160
fishing or voice fishing

505
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,480
social engineering phone calls so what i

506
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
like to do

507
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
is i actually like to place the first

508
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,760
handful of calls while they're listening

509
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,559
too

510
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,039
right and that way they could hear how

511
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
it goes

512
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,120
but one of the things is i know it's

513
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,799
scary for a lot of people especially in

514
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,600
this kind of

515
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,840
this kind of work and they're going

516
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
outside their comfort zone so sometimes

517
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
even if you're not going outside of your

518
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
comfort zone you're you're helping push

519
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,280
people outside of theirs to progress in

520
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
their career

521
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,280
all right so moving on to y'all

522
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
how many people here would classify

523
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
themselves as introverts

524
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,080
show of hands a good amount of people

525
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,000
right and i think that's very very

526
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,240
common in our industry right we have a

527
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,760
lot of introverts and

528
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,480
and one of the things that is really

529
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
hard to get outside of your comfort zone

530
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,440
is meeting new people right networking

531
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,559
with people

532
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,480
and it's extremely difficult and that's

533
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,240
one of the things that really helped me

534
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,280
progress in my career

535
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
is going to conferences meeting people

536
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
every single job that i've had is

537
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
because of a connection that i've made

538
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
through networking

539
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,640
i can't explain like how how much this

540
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,360
helps

541
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,640
now i'm actually going to ask y'all to

542
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
do something right now and some of you

543
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
will probably hate me especially the

544
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,720
people who raise their hands

545
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,799
i want to take five minutes and i want

546
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,080
everyone to get up and

547
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
introduce themselves and meet someone

548
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,919
new now please keep in mind the bands

549
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,360
and social distancing and all that good

550
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,320
stuff

551
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
but just for five minutes go meet

552
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,760
someone new right

553
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,120
help them get out of your comfort zone

554
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,799
you get out of your comfort zone

555
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,400
and now you have a brand new connection

556
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,679
at the beginning of the day and we'll

557
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,720
see how that goes so just

558
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,520
five minutes make a new friend that's

559
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:49,840
all i'm asking

560
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,380
[Applause]

561
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,460
[Applause]

562
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,710
[Music]

563
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,989
[Applause]

564
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,840
[Music]

565
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,460
okay

566
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:25,849
[Music]

567
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,029
[Music]

568
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
oh

569
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,240
[Applause]

570
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,439
[Music]

571
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,960
[Applause]

572
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
uh

573
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
yes

574
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,789
[Applause]

575
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,279
[Music]

576
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,370
[Music]

577
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,530
[Applause]

578
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,600
is

579
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
and i'm going to grab this and move it

580
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
down just because that big orange thing

581
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,860
just attracts everything on the camera

582
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,039
[Applause]

583
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:51,840
it needs to put it down

584
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,010
[Applause]

585
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,160
[Music]

586
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,840
all right if we want to start heading

587
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:18,130
back to our seats

588
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,209
[Applause]

589
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,880
is

590
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,960
all right show of hands how many people

591
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
met someone brand new for the first time

592
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,159
today

593
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,440
yay either y'all are lying or hopefully

594
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,080
you're not

595
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,480
awesome great so sometimes

596
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,400
meeting people new talking to someone

597
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,840
you've never talked to before at a

598
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,120
conference right like

599
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,520
it can be completely intimidating and i

600
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,880
totally get that

601
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,320
so hopefully this was at least a good

602
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,360
little warm up a little exercise to

603
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,279
get you all to do that so some ideas

604
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,799
um to get y'all out of your comfort zone

605
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,360
one of the things too is you want to be

606
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,799
able to do things to give back to your

607
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,400
community right so you're getting back

608
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,600
you're getting out of your comfort zone

609
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,440
you're providing to the community

610
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,720
and you're also probably learning things

611
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
in the process so here's a good handful

612
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,200
of

613
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,039
ideas now i also get a common complaint

614
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,159
from people

615
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,520
when i say something like have you

616
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
thought about starting a blog right

617
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,360
and that's it's already been done before

618
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,200
like why would i blog about

619
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,120
these new tools i'm researching or

620
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,480
instruction guides because someone's

621
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,520
already done it

622
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,760
right have you all thought that yeah i'm

623
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,039
getting lots of nuts

624
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,000
so my thing against that and i think you

625
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,880
should still

626
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,360
proceed is because just because it's

627
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,120
been done before doesn't mean it's one

628
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,559
been done right

629
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,120
uh two been done recently and three it

630
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
hasn't been done in your perspective

631
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,880
right so the other day i was trying to

632
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,720
figure out how to use a new tool and i

633
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,919
found tons of content

634
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,919
tons of blog posts that explained very

635
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,919
detailed how to use it

636
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
but the thing about it was it was all

637
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,640
the previous version of the tool

638
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,840
i couldn't find anything for the brand

639
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
new version that recently came out

640
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,520
and the other thing is i didn't get to

641
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,200
see right

642
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,440
um or sorry so i couldn't find any

643
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
information about this brand new tool so

644
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
again if you create content that is

645
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,159
awesome the other thing i'd love to see

646
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,320
is when people fail right i like to see

647
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,919
steps that people take

648
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,039
to fail because one that shows they're

649
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,039
human but two i'm probably doing those

650
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,400
same steps and i'm failing that's why

651
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,600
i'm trying to get help

652
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,919
so it's really interesting to see other

653
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,600
perspectives and how other people do

654
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,320
things

655
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,400
so again that's just a couple of ideas

656
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,520
that um

657
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,200
i had for how to get out of your comfort

658
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,720
zone i'm gonna give you homework

659
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,919
right i want you to think about

660
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,919
something that you can do either

661
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,720
in your personal life or your work life

662
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
that you've been scared to do

663
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,679
and i want you to commit it to memory

664
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,200
something that's going to put you

665
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,400
outside of your comfort zone now what

666
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,279
you think about it

667
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,720
now once you have that i actually want

668
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
you to think about a plan of how

669
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
to get there right how are you going to

670
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,880
be able to accomplish this goal

671
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,640
maybe it's a new skill set so are you

672
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,159
going to take a half a day on the

673
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,360
weekends to learn it

674
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,960
are you going to block off your calendar

675
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,360
for 30 minutes monday through friday

676
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,039
right it's one thing to come up with

677
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,200
with your idea but actually having a

678
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,960
plan to execute the idea

679
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,720
is half the battle all right so

680
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,320
i am wrapping up before some questions

681
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,880
answer so some cl key takeaways

682
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
um really just get outside your comfort

683
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,080
zone

684
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,880
um i again keep going back to that day

685
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,080
that i was sitting on the plane

686
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,000
and just did not even want to go to

687
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,480
defcon and i'm so glad i did

688
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
and there's so many moments when i look

689
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
back on my life where i'm like i was so

690
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,159
nervous or i did not want to do

691
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:44,640
something

692
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,880
and those moments actually ended up

693
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
being the most

694
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,640
life-changing for me right so many

695
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,600
things come

696
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
once you actually get outside of that

697
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,640
comfort zone

698
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,760
so with that being said question

699
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
time and if you don't have questions and

700
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,039
you can think of some later

701
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,799
for better or worse my dms are open on

702
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,880
twitter um so

703
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,320
i know very brave so far it hasn't been

704
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,799
murdered yes

705
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,240
questions

706
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,559
um so you talked about doing the default

707
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,559
section but you also had a really cool

708
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,720
experience with nola mod

709
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,679
um but you also talked about how like

710
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,799
makeup

711
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,640
and bracket arts and things like that

712
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
were part of your prior background

713
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,440
can you kind of tell people about the

714
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,120
cool thing that you

715
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,919
pulled that background information into

716
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,320
being successful with that particular

717
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,600
exercise yeah so uh i

718
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,120
so having the background special effects

719
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,960
makeup i got to do a lot of things like

720
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
make prosthetics

721
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
make fake blood all that kind of good

722
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,279
stuff i actually

723
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,880
got to work on a lot of like really cool

724
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,559
like indie and low budget college stuff

725
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,919
and if you've seen it i will judge you

726
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,120
horribly

727
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,520
um but because of that skill set i'm

728
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
actually able to leverage some of it

729
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,480
into what i do so there's this really

730
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,880
cool competition called saintcon

731
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,520
and it happens every year in utah and so

732
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,039
they had

733
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
a competition called the vault and it

734
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,320
was a physical security challenge

735
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,720
and it's actually a whole makeshift

736
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,320
building or i should say room

737
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
so on the front door had rfid it had

738
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
lock picks it had on inside motion

739
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,360
sensors alarms

740
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,840
tons of different things and so i

741
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,320
competed in 2017

742
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,840
and the team i was on with jc davis

743
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,279
so we got in we got through the

744
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,600
obstacles but the last piece was a

745
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
biometric safe

746
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,000
you needed a thumbprint to open it

747
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and so we did our first run we got and

748
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,440
we realized we needed that like oh

749
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,799
like how are we going to get this part

750
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,159
and and you couldn't lock pick it that

751
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,600
was the other thing you had to like

752
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,200
and you couldn't cut someone's finger

753
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,120
off unfortunately

754
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,640
and so what i did was um we did get a

755
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,240
fingerprint we lifted it from someone we

756
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,840
had them hold something so i had a good

757
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,640
fingerprint

758
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,559
but what i did is i went back and i

759
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,080
created a whole lab

760
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,799
trying to make that fingerprint right i

761
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,720
tried lifting it with charcoal

762
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
i tried gummy bear stuff like i tried

763
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
like everything you could think of and

764
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,159
read about to do it and it was so

765
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,120
frustrating because

766
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,679
i was up the entire night and then it

767
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,039
hit me

768
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,919
like 4am like i can make a prosthetic of

769
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,600
someone's fingerprint like why am i not

770
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,880
just doing this

771
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,720
and so i was actually able to to get

772
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,279
a working proof of concept and then i

773
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:31,840
got there

774
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
and i was able to keep going through the

775
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,240
steps but i actually recreated uh with a

776
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,919
prosthetic someone's fingerprint and we

777
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,279
used that to get into the safe and we

778
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,480
were able to win that year from that

779
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,520
competition

780
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
it was really cool it was really

781
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,640
cool

782
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,120
thank you

783
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,440
yes so when you were talking about

784
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,120
um the part where you were going into

785
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,960
the building was a cla one or whatever

786
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,679
and uh

787
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,240
you ended up speaking out with your

788
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,880
laser on

789
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,279
but when you were walking in and you

790
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,120
noticed the person had the apparatus on

791
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,159
their face

792
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,159
i was hoping you could maybe dive in if

793
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,519
there is more to tell

794
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,760
about just exactly what happened next

795
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,880
how you gave them

796
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
the feeling like i know it's not okay

797
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,880
but it's okay they're gonna keep going

798
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
what happened to that exact moment yeah

799
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,080
that's a great question

800
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
so as i was tailgating the woman and i

801
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,519
saw i saw the look on her face and i

802
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,200
knew she she realized she had up

803
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,720
but she didn't know what to do

804
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,000
um i put myself in an employee's

805
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,559
position

806
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,640
right like i tried i do like i try to do

807
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,919
a lot of method acting i know that

808
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,440
sounds corny but it helps right i'm

809
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,880
i'm thinking okay if i'm just an

810
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,640
employee walking into this building

811
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
why would i say anything to her right

812
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
like i wouldn't even though i i noticed

813
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
she had that look of fate that look on

814
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,480
her face i wasn't going to like correct

815
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,960
her or try to like validate my reason to

816
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,159
be there i wasn't going to say anything

817
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:48,880
because

818
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,960
a regular employee wouldn't do that so i

819
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
just smiled and confidently just kept

820
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,760
walking

821
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,440
now i didn't know where i was going once

822
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,200
i got in because i didn't find like any

823
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,720
building layouts or pictures

824
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,559
so i actually ended up turning and

825
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,080
walking like almost into the men's

826
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,880
bathroom

827
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,480
but i was confident and she had turned

828
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,159
at that point and that's fine um

829
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,320
but a lot of times it's putting yourself

830
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,000
in the position of who you're pretending

831
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,039
to be

832
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,600
and so absolutely like when i would have

833
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,799
first started doing this i probably

834
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,559
would have wanted to be like oh no like

835
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,000
i'm just here for this but

836
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,679
i was impersonating someone so i

837
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,760
couldn't justify that so

838
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,039
i just try to put myself in that

839
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,840
position and be as confident as i could

840
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,840
absolutely yep great question thank you

841
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,720
any other questions

842
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
yes

843
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,039
yeah so the mail room it was definitely

844
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,640
not locked off the door was propped up

845
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,399
it was actually propped open by a shred

846
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:52,880
bin

847
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,559
that had like no protection on pop so

848
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,000
that was kind of fun i had to take some

849
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,080
pictures of that stuff um but yeah

850
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,240
inside it had like printing areas

851
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,559
um different shred bins and then it had

852
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,480
like the big cubicle wall with like

853
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
employees names and

854
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,480
and mail slots where you could put stuff

855
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,840
so very very open

856
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
any other questions you all are kind of

857
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,519
quiet now

858
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:25,840
no yes

859
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,279
so i grew up a theater kid like i did

860
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,880
tons of acting so i think that's

861
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,399
definitely helped

862
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,640
as an adult i haven't done anything like

863
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,960
that i have done improv which

864
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
if you're really wanting to get into

865
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,720
social engineering i 100

866
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,039
um recommend doing improv because it

867
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,640
will put you on your feet

868
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
make you feel uncomfortable which is

869
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,840
exactly what happens um

870
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,039
in these situations but not since uh

871
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,880
being an adult i think the biggest thing

872
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
is getting in that mindset

873
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,120
right of who i'm pretending to be um

874
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,320
i'll tell a really quick story here

875
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,120
before i go

876
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,240
so speaking of the method acting um

877
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,840
so this was a physical security

878
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,240
assessment i did in amsterdam

879
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,440
and um it was really hard to get into

880
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,480
the building

881
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,239
but long story short like i got there it

882
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,839
was a bunch of headaches

883
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,480
and i walked in to do recon because the

884
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,839
building was brand new

885
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,760
brand new and there's no even it wasn't

886
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,199
even on google maps yet

887
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,960
so i had no clue what i was getting into

888
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,239
i couldn't find pictures

889
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,520
so i walk into the building and the

890
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,879
second i walk in the reception is like

891
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,159
no you need to go

892
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,000
and like i still to this day don't know

893
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,918
what like gave that away that i

894
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,040
shouldn't have been there

895
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,359
and so i was frustrated i was like

896
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,199
terrified like i flew all that way to

897
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,560
like get into this building

898
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,320
and i walk and do recon and i'm already

899
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,760
thrown out

900
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,399
and so i went back and i just started

901
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,119
researching

902
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,079
as much as i can trying to find an angle

903
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:48,960
and i found

904
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,119
that their americas had an investor

905
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,879
relations branch

906
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,960
and so what i did is i called the

907
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
receptionist at the amsterdam branch

908
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,480
pretending to be someone high up in the

909
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,359
company in america

910
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,200
and said hey we have this investor

911
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,119
relations uh contractor

912
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,359
coming out to survey the site to meet

913
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,040
with potential investors

914
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
um she's going to be there tomorrow

915
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,240
please you know make sure she has

916
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,520
whatever she wants

917
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,880
and they're like okay cool like oh my

918
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
god it's working and so

919
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,760
i get there and the receptionist greets

920
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
me with coffee

921
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,320
um and just like asking what you know

922
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,520
what they can do for me like well i

923
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,040
would love a tour of the building

924
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,240
um and so she brings in the actual

925
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,640
facilities manager to give me a tour

926
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
and so he's going through i'm like okay

927
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,839
well how can i get like information how

928
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,440
can i get findings out of this

929
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,200
so i start saying you know we have some

930
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
potential investors

931
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,560
but the last company they invested in

932
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,000
they actually got like breach

933
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
like someone broke into their building

934
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,839
i'm like so i need to know like what's

935
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,920
 up here so we could fix it

936
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,680
and he started spilling everything he's

937
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
like well the cameras are plugged in but

938
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,119
we're not really recording

939
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,560
if we have people coming in we leave the

940
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
back door propped open so they don't

941
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,599
have to go through the receptionist like

942
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,520
he started giving me like i didn't even

943
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,960
have to like go and do anything else

944
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,800
like he gave it all to me

945
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,480
and so as we're walking through he

946
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,920
starts asking me about like all these

947
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
companies i'm gonna be meeting with

948
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,760
which

949
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,880
 i wasn't prepared for and so i was

950
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,119
like

951
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,200
you know well i i said i had a meeting

952
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,640
with three different companies i wanted

953
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,440
to bring them in

954
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
i said what's that process like how can

955
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,200
i actually get these people in to give

956
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,240
them a tour

957
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
he said oh well let me introduce you to

958
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,920
jenna and she she's the one that would

959
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,880
host all that

960
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,079
and so i'm sitting there talking to

961
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,599
jenna and she's like okay when do you

962
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,800
want these people to come in like well

963
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,920
by end of the week would be great

964
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,520
because i'm only here for a week

965
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,760
and she's like oh no we're busy and i

966
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,599
put myself in that person's shoes i was

967
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,520
like oh hell no you're not busy

968
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,079
these are potential investors we need to

969
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,040
get them in here

970
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,079
now and so i was really able to get into

971
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,839
that mindset of that person

972
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,839
and that person apparently was a

973
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,078
but

974
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,599
and then i felt bad because she

975
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,400
scheduled it and i never came back

976
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,520
so whoops um but but

977
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,440
um getting getting in that mindset was

978
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,880
super helpful um

979
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,440
it's been very beneficial to my career

980
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,240
not making friends
