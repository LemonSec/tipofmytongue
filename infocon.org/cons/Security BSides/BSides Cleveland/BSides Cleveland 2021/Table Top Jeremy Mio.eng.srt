and uh i lead uh

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
coyote county's uh cyber security

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,759
program

31
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,000
i also do a bunch of train stuff with

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
this crazy person

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,410
uh sitting in the front row

34
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,509
[Applause]

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,680
not crazy for the record just a joke um

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
and uh we give uh hands-on

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,840
instant response tabletop exercises we

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
use a d20 system

39
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
so we use rpg style gaming to get people

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
out of their element

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,440
and to really go through a lot of

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
scenarios that they might see talks on

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,800
or might hear of and never actually

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
get anything this looks usually a lot

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
better uh

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
online but it is hands-on instant

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,959
response there's a lot of slides here

48
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
you can just right there just me it

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,879
doesn't work with the projector

50
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
and um this is usually a three hour

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,319
training we give

52
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
uh so i'm just gonna like blow through

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,519
some of these slides

54
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,879
uh there's a lot of demos that are in

55
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,000
here yeah yeah

56
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
no i'm going to give this in like 15

57
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,080
minutes i

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,400
exactly five minutes for questions so uh

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
we're gonna go through a lot of just

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,519
about tabletops right so

61
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,040
a lot of people there's look at that

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,680
agenda so we're gonna kind of

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
no polls because we're not online uh

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
and just overview of table topics how

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,200
many people have been involved in

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,839
tabletops

67
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,840
great all you can come up to this stage

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
and you can give this presentation

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
and uh we go over a specific style of

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
tabletops we do

71
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
uh it's a really this is like it's a lot

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,000
right

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,840
above much

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,239
is that better no

75
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,040
was it good before top of the cleavage

76
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,439
right here

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,740
okay

78
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,360
[Music]

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,120
so we we use 15 minute table tops um

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,799
and it gets into about an hour of

81
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,560
tabletop with a team

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,680
it's built to be within uh like a

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,319
technical

84
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,478
or management so you can actually

85
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
understand and get a lot of action

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
after action reports this isn't working

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,839
well

88
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,600
can i just hold it i can just do this

89
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,720
is that what it is okay all right

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
so um we go through goals and objectives

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
we'll go through tabletop stuff and

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
importance of after action reports

93
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
uh so when you go through these

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
15-minute tabletops they're very easy

95
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,280
scenarios

96
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
uh they have discussion points so you

97
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
can focus on specific

98
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
items compliance frameworks miter attack

99
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
or anything that you want to focus on

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,000
uh again goes over through like what

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
table tops are

102
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
right discussion based scenarios um

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,320
and i can't see anything through here so

104
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,680
there you go you can read that um

105
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,199
i'm struggling right now uh so

106
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,720
the goals and objectives right so you

107
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,639
want to break uh table top scenarios

108
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,440
into meaningful

109
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
learning points uh you want to make sure

110
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,120
that

111
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
you're not going to have any scope creep

112
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
in your tabletop scenarios a lot of

113
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
people might

114
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,198
conduct tabletop scenarios and

115
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
and uh they'll they'll kind of go

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,880
through the what if scenarios

117
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,479
and they'll go into this what if rabbit

118
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
hole right so you don't want to do that

119
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,919
you want to have some type of focus you

120
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,600
want to get everybody

121
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
on the same page and really go and have

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,479
a goal and objective of tabletops

123
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,800
and uh you always also want your

124
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,960
tabletop discussion points to be

125
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
based on your instant response framework

126
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,000
if you don't have an instant response

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,639
framework

128
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,720
you can use any one of the either sans

129
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
or nist

130
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,919
so you want to have just basic like

131
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,440
identification detection your

132
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,479
containment

133
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,319
eradication and your recovery and post

134
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,479
stuff right so you want to always make

135
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,520
sure you have

136
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,960
you know some type of objectives with

137
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
that communication is big

138
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
a lot of tabletop scenarios will start

139
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,639
um in pro

140
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,440
in and companies will have tabletop

141
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,240
programs

142
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
where they don't have a really mature or

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,360
developed cyber security program

144
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,199
and even if it's communication you might

145
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,000
start there there's a lot of places that

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,840
don't even have who to contact or an

147
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,120
incident who is

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
the point of contact for these systems

149
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,240
who are these system owners right you

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
can start there you don't have to

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
get in all of the crazy you know edr

152
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,919
containment stuff you just need to start

153
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,400
with

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
knowing what you have and who to contact

155
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,919
to find more information during some

156
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
type of scenario

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
there's do's and don'ts here

158
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,280
you can't really see that but uh you

159
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,080
know again

160
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
break it into meaningful points some of

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,360
the don'ts

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
one of the main ones person right you

163
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,400
don't know who that person is you're

164
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,120
that person

165
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,919
so uh there's always going to be that

166
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,240
person that either

167
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
has the what if all the way until like

168
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
until death or they're the person that

169
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,520
always says they can do everything they

170
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,639
have all the logs they know where

171
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,479
everything is or the person that

172
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,479
is that knowledge holder that keeper of

173
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,280
knowledge you don't want to

174
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,919
you want to get that person to not only

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,759
be involved into these even if they are

176
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,360
that person you want them to

177
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,639
see if they can have some type of

178
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,599
resolution with that

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,800
back online technical difficulties

180
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
oh it is the next slide look at that

181
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,560
yep just keep going you don't have that

182
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
much time all right so

183
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,319
um one of the main things that you want

184
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,400
to have in a tabletop program and

185
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
is another reason why we cut everything

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
down into 15 minutes which really is an

187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,919
hour right so it's 15 minutes for

188
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
discussion and

189
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,199
uh one hour overall um for the whole

190
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,319
tabletop

191
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,639
you but that you want to build frequency

192
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,400
right so you want to be able to do that

193
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,039
weekly um would be nice but even monthly

194
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,800
so you can have a monthly table top it's

195
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,520
one hour get some uh technical folk you

196
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
also get some management in there

197
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,879
and maybe you bring in legal uh and you

198
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,160
just put it through a scenario and these

199
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
scenarios are very basic

200
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,599
uh but if you just get your legal in

201
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,960
just grab them and just

202
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
um or or tell them don't grab your legal

203
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,400
teams but

204
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,878
you can get them in and

205
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,520
uh review uh table tops with them and

206
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
then just continue that on that path

207
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
especially if you don't have cyber

208
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
insurance you don't know how to use your

209
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,399
cyber insurance

210
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,760
if you have cyber service you've never

211
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,519
talked to your legal team get them into

212
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,880
a tabletop scenario

213
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,360
then have them bring the cyber security

214
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
uh insurance information in there

215
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
because there's a lot of clauses and

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,279
there's a lot of stuff that you're not

217
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,880
going to understand a lot of stuff they

218
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
might pretend to understand but if you

219
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
don't know that stuff or the all the

220
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,080
clauses there's a lot of stuff with

221
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
ransomware

222
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,839
that um your insurance might not cover

223
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,480
anymore

224
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
uh it's a big deal to understand that

225
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
stuff build the program out six months

226
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
if you're doing monthly or

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
you know uh even i wouldn't even suggest

228
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,240
doing quarterly tabletops at this level

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,120
that's why you want to do

230
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,360
monthly you might do larger tabletops

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,320
for a quarter

232
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,240
so you might have you know executive

233
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
management you know all the teams

234
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
all the business units in there do some

235
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
crazy like one day or

236
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,959
one week tabletop but you know those are

237
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
good things to get to but you can start

238
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,200
out like

239
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,640
again 15 minutes um

240
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,199
one hour

241
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
next slide creation process i'm not

242
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
going to go into this

243
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
but you can build tabletops we're going

244
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,959
to go right into a tabletop

245
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,920
right charters are important right so

246
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
you want some type of charter if you

247
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,399
don't know what a charter is

248
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,040
um essentially a document that defines

249
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
whatever initiative or project you're

250
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,360
doing

251
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,839
um i'm not you know some type of you

252
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,440
know crazy uh project manager or

253
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,080
anything like that

254
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,920
so i didn't use a lot of charters until

255
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
i was in fortune 500

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
and it's good to have some type of

257
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
simple charters that have your purpose

258
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
your goals

259
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
your members decision guidelines are

260
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,880
good and also communication

261
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
communication is good not only for um

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,279
you know how you're going to communicate

263
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,480
the general program that people are

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,040
involved

265
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,200
but also every quarter after you do all

266
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
your monthly weekly table tops

267
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,519
you'll want to let the executives know

268
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
hey we did

269
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,920
tabletops this quarter we had 25

270
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,200
action items and we completed 10 of them

271
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,079
that helps a lot not only for executive

272
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:28,880
management

273
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,079
it also helps a lot uh

274
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,640
for when if you get audited or when you

275
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,079
have cyber insurance

276
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,120
uh findings or cyber insurance claw or

277
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
cyber insurance incident that you have

278
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
to get your cyber insurance on and they

279
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,519
have to show that you did some type of

280
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,800
uh due care or diligence you can show

281
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,920
that right and you can show that

282
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,360
hopefully in other ways but this is a

283
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,000
basic way as well

284
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,160
you can crosswalk these crosswalking

285
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,000
them is you know taking

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
all your you know nist miter cis

287
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,040
controls

288
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,519
uh you could even use uh the get gooder

289
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,640
program which i

290
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,959
uh learned about this morning so shout

291
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,000
out to

292
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
alex wherever he is and uh you can

293
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,399
crosswalk these right so

294
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,720
this is just a crosswalk and you can

295
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
have these specific

296
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,800
items inside your tabletop so then when

297
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,760
you're trying to

298
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
understand your gaps you can at least

299
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,480
tie it into some type of compliance now

300
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,120
like earlier client compliance isn't the

301
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,760
end all

302
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
but it's something at least you can tag

303
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,880
and be able to understand

304
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
any type of gaps you have and it's

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
easier for the business and others at

306
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,720
the end of the day

307
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,160
as much as we might complain about

308
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,320
compliance it's what they understand

309
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
and it's what they're going to tie it to

310
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,360
regardless if we want to change it or

311
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,160
not

312
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,839
so it's good for us to try to get other

313
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,279
types of frameworks in

314
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,680
but we have to ultimately bubble that up

315
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,959
the compliance so

316
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,360
we can make all of the uh executive

317
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,279
suits happy

318
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,440
after a tabletop you always want during

319
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,399
this tabletop

320
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,839
you want some type of after action

321
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,519
report these can get

322
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,120
all kinds of praise you have lots of

323
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
pages but you want to have some

324
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
main points here you want to have

325
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,079
obviously who was there what the

326
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,040
scenario was

327
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
but you also want to have strengths and

328
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,839
weaknesses it's going to be a pretty

329
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,959
depressing scenario

330
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,079
all the time and it should be that

331
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,440
because you're trying to get gaps you're

332
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,800
trying to understand

333
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
uh all your areas that could be improved

334
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,279
you want to put people in uncomfortable

335
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,399
scenarios

336
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
right like talking randomly out of a hat

337
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,279
or a pumpkin box here right now

338
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
i know right so but i'm in my comfort

339
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,639
zone so

340
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,320
i might start dancing here get some

341
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,040
music on um

342
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
so you want to have those those goal

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
there are those strengths and weaknesses

344
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
uh you always want to have some type of

345
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,839
strength

346
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,760
right so you want to find something even

347
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
if it's you know hey we're in the room

348
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
we've never been in the room before

349
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,920
um i've tried to get people that have

350
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,440
never been in one room before together

351
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,880
and do a scenario and it's been really

352
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,839
interesting

353
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
um so that's one thing to have the other

354
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,639
things are recommendations right you

355
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,760
can't see it but it's short-term

356
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
recommendations long-term

357
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,920
recommendations

358
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,279
you have to be able to split these out

359
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,959
you want to do if you want to mfi all

360
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,440
the things

361
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,600
that's great you definitely need that it

362
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
might be a long term goal

363
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,959
short term what can you do well let's

364
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
mfa the privileged accounts right let's

365
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
mfa these uh critical business uh

366
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,240
units right let's see how we can do that

367
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,959
let's get them

368
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,480
involved let's get all the executives

369
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,639
mfa's right with some short-term stuff

370
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,560
and there's other things you could too

371
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,480
and make sure it's signed off have these

372
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
things signed off

373
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,399
um and you know have hopefully you have

374
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,680
in your charter right and you have your

375
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,560
stakeholders

376
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
and you can get these uh things signed

377
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
off and you have these stack of papers

378
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,320
and you you solve all the cybers with it

379
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,959
q and a

380
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,639
whew

381
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,160
this is technically the first break in

382
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,000
the training so um everyone can grab a

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,240
drink

384
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,399
cheers cheers

385
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,920
do we want to go back wait well let's

386
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,440
just try to find one scenario and i'm

387
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,639
going to call on people it's going to be

388
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,199
fun

389
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,560
boom look at that

390
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,760
um look at this oh an employee in

391
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,360
accounting it's called a security

392

department

393
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720

394
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,560
uh reporting a wire transfer

395
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,959
right their wire transfer endpoint

396
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,120
has a splash screen with a countdown

397
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880

438
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,519

439
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,680
right attempt to remove nah oh

440
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
right exactly that's the whole point

441
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,920
it's the intern

442
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,040
fire the intern right hbo max it right

443
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
so

444
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
uh contact my iso so right so you want

445
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,880
to have your learning points right so

446
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,399
you have you know do you pay it

447
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,160
you know sometimes you might you know if

448
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
you're a large gas company things like

449
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,720
that

450
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,480
or you know uh hidden supply chain

451
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,919
issues

452
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,199
too soon um so

453
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,199
you know you have to do some type of

454
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,959
triage you want to validate right you

455
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,400
want to validate you want to see what's

456
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,359
going on

457
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,439
another point with these tabletops is

458
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,480
look you have these little

459
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,319
nice little nist functions right here

460
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,640
you can tag them and then you can have

461
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
a whole tabletop program and you can

462
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,240
have that build out and tied in this

463
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,919
functions and your tabletops don't need

464
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,720
to be

465
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
more complex than that right so you can

466
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
have the base scenario

467
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
someone gets something that looks like

468
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,440
ransomware what do you do

469
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,039
you'd be surprised a lot of places that

470
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
don't know what's going on with that

471
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,320
right and then you can have some

472
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,640
discussion points have in your after

473
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,520
action report

474
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,400
you can have that in about you know 45

475
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,679
minutes to an hour

476
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
and you can take those after action

477
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,720
reports and you can

478
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,000
attach to some type of management

479
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,280
meeting you can have that stack of

480
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,039
papers go over the statuses

481
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,760
maybe some of them get put into projects

482
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,120
maybe you get you know some more

483
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,559
charters

484
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,799
and you can develop a lot of material

485
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,039
that executives understand and say oh

486
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,080
we went through the scenario we

487
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,760
discussed it with management we wouldn't

488
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
be able to respond with

489
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
uh um you know well we don't even have

490
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
the documentation we don't even know

491
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,919
who's who would contact during this

492
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,160
uh during anything right so you could

493
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,360
have one focused just on

494
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,440
a law enforcement something happens you

495
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
have to report to law enforcement what

496
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,360
do you do

497
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
it doesn't matter what it is it just

498
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,360
matters that you had to report to law

499
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,039
enforcement how do you do that do you

500
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,640
have contacts in your local field office

501
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,760
do you have

502
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
um contacts with other federal agencies

503
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,080
for wire fraud right do you have your

504
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,679
contacts for your secret service field

505
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,440
office the fbi field office

506
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,039
and if you have the contact what do you

507
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,960
do with that uh right so you want to

508
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,480
build that kind of stuff

509
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
and that's why i'm going to go back to

510
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,840
now q a so we just like inception that

511
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,400
back

512
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
all right and that's why i'm here

513
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,640
question

514
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,440
really do you give this as a training

515
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,799
anywhere

516
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,559
do i give this as a training anywhere i

517
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,960
do we i

518
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
i am a part of a training that an

519
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,280
amazing person named amanda berlin runs

520
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,799
and uh we give not only

521
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,039
uh tabletop trainings but also instant

522
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:27,919
response

523
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,480
trainings that have hands-on demoing as

524
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,440
well as

525
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,280
a really good role-playing game

526
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,400
that is the last day and you get put

527
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,799
into

528
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,200
different organizations you get

529
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
different types of super cool skills

530
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
and you get all kinds of different

531
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,799
titles so you might be

532
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,360
the coolest crazy red team pen tester

533
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,080
person

534
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
hacker you might be put at the legal as

535
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
legal counsel

536
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,640
or a ceo right um and you'll have to

537
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,760
work through that and hopefully you

538
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,520
survive it and not blow up the world

539
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,240
because

540
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,720
two teams have blown up the world in our

541
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,760
scenarios

542
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,400
um and uh that's not good you don't want

543
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,880
the world to blow up

544
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,840
question okay so we take this training

545
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,559
class

546
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,960
will we be able to map what happens in

547
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,600
our scenario

548
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,400
so uh will if you we take this training

549
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
will you be able to map it

550
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,799
to the to the get gooder uh so we

551
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,120
might have a you know a a close

552
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,159
partnership with

553
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,880
the get gooder framework and that might

554
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,120
be mapped we currently do crosswalk to

555
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,760
both

556
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,280
cis the nist and um and miter but i

557
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,400
think the get gooder

558
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
is going to grant a lot of traction and

559
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,039
we're going to map to that

560
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,159
we will crosswalk yeah it might be a

561
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,480
skip

562
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,520
so

563
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,760
oh is that a drink

564
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
next question

565
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,240

566
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,840
dance question

567
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,600
dance uh we do not have any current

568
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,080
scenarios that cover dancing

569
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,919
but we can we can try to crosswalk that

570
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,380
we might do the electric slide

571
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,409
