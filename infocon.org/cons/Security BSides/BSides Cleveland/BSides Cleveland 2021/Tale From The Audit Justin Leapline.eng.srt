1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
still waiting i'm i'm recording now okay

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,520
so this is a talk i did a couple of

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,480
years ago

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
um i figured keep it light keep it

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,240
entertaining so i have a number of

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,160
stories being almost 20 years in the

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,200
industry

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
with various customers regulators

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,320
everything like that

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
just thought i'd share a couple of those

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,000
interesting stories that i experienced

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,520
uh with this so

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,400
first off we're going to hit regulators

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,279
so

15
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,519
how many here have had the pleasure of

16
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,760
working with the ffiec

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
examiners all that stuff they are

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
a special breed of people let's just put

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,320
it that way um

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,280
so a couple of companies ago i was a

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,000
head of

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,960
grc for diebold and we were considered a

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,559
critical service provider to the

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,160
financial industry

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,800
so with that we get the pleasure roped

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,079
in to

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,160
you know take part of the examinations

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,920
and you know if you're not familiar with

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,640
it

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,960
especially as a service provider in the

31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,480
industry they pull

32
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,960
everybody in the occ the fdic the ncua

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
state examiners everybody gets to

34
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,840
participate in this and they go through

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,360
if you ever looked at the booklets

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,119
they're basically written so that they

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:11,600
can

38
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
make up what they want you know for what

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,040
to enforce with you

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,680
they're paragraph driven not very well

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
broken down

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,439
everything like that so we had i'd say

43
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,240
month-long

44
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
examination there they you know tearing

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,520
apart our policies interviewing a whole

46
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,280
bunch of people and everything

47
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,040
well one of the times the lead examiner

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,799
was coming in from lunch or something

49
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,680
like that

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
um coming in i was meeting them at the

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
door at the reception area

52
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
and there was something on the news

53
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
basically that you know there was

54
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
something like solar flares happening

55
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,680
you know every now and then there'll be

56
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,119
something like hey there's activity of

57
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,240
solar flares

58
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
there might be some satellite disruption

59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
everything like that so he comes in

60
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,479
he's like hey justin i just saw on the

61
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,520

62

64
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,159
news at lunch and everything

65
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
he's like what does diebel do to monitor

66
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,560
for solar flares and how do you protect

67
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
against that

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,719
and so me you know as kind of my free

69
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,920

70

73
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,239

74
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,840

75
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,959

77
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,080
that

78
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,800
so i'm trying to hold back even laughing

79
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,280

80
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,760

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,000
i'll be back

84
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,200
with this i go upstairs uh to my team

85
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
and some of the other people i'm like

86
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,000
guys you will not believe the question i

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,640
just got

88
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,360
asked um and we had a great time we're

89
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,720
like should we wrap our

90
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,360
servers in like tin foil like what will

91
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
be acceptable mitigation for this

92
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
and we made some stuff up and everything

93
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
but it was just one of those things it

94
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,400
was just uh

95
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,280
kind of crazy my next regulator story

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,879
that deals with the

97
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,360
ncua and i've been in and out of

98
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,159
consulting

99
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,080
you know managing security programs

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
consulting on them

101
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,640
one of the things and this is

102
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
pre-trusted sec um

103
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
we did a number of like virtual cso

104
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
stuff help companies actually kind of

105
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
manage and you know handle different

106
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
audits and everything like that

107
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,000
and i was contracting with a credit

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
union

109
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
literally the smallest credit union

110
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,400
possible they had a

111
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,959
one branch credit union in the middle of

112
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,920
this farm field

113
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
like you can't get any smaller than that

114
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
in the uh financial area

115
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
well they brought us in they had major

116
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
problems with one of their ncua

117
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,159
uh examiners and i got to see some of

118
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,440
the reports and everything and this is

119
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,959
the main reason why you know i came in

120
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,680
to help

121
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
help him out he wanted first off

122
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,480
a plan in case a helicopter would crash

123
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,040
into their one branch and then people

124
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,879
wouldn't get access to it

125
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,840
additionally he had wanted a plan that

126
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,640
if

127
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,799
all the roads were closed all the roads

128
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,840
were closed

129
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,400
that the main owner would be able to

130
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
still come into the branch so she

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,519
literally had to take a picture of her

132
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,200
bike in her garage

133
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,920
to put it into evidence to say here's

134
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
how it would come into

135
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
this she was explained to me she's like

136
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
if all the roads are closed we're not

137
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,519
opening

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,440
like that's just not a thing that's

139
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
happening uh with this

140
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
so if anybody has to deal with regulars

141
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,280
it's it's

142
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
an awesome thing with that so

143
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
another thing and who wants uh a dave

144
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,000
kennedy story

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
oh yeah yeah is it a new one uh

146
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
i mean it happened in the past so i

147
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,680
don't know what that means

148
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
so but it's it's an entertaining one so

149
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
obviously diebold

150
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,840
uh dave and i work together uh with this

151
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,320
and

152
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,680
with that we have a number of different

153
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,520
customers coming in asking us what are

154
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,960
you doing with their information how are

155
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,639
you securing it and everything like that

156
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,080
and that was my team that primarily

157
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,919
dealt with this and dave

158
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,440
every now and then comes in especially

159
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
if it's a bigger customer obviously

160
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
being the cso just kind of making an

161
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,600
appearance

162
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
so he's in there he's working his laptop

163
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
we're handling all the questions and

164
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,400
everything

165
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,039
and one of the kind of assessors that

166
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,440
were there for uh this company

167
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,199
um we're talking about a couple of

168
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,960
different things and social engineering

169
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,759
came up and

170
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,080
you know this is these are a mate set

171
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,800
you know

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
kind of uh known expert into in around

173
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
this space and everything

174
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,440
and he's like dave do you know about

175
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,880
social engineering

176
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
looking over to him and dave like he's

177
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
like

178
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,840
yeah yeah i do he's like let me tell you

179
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
about social engineering

180
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
social engineering is the act of

181
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
engineering people

182
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
and he's explaining this to dave kennedy

183
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
here you know as we're doing this and

184
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,680
i'm

185
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
again holding back all the laughter i

186
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
can with this

187
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,240
um with it and dave was obviously

188
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
professional and all that stuff but it

189
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,400
was

190
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,639
so funny davian mansplained what social

191
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,720
engineering was by this customer

192
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,120
um then he goes on he's like yeah i kind

193
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
of wrote this tool that does this and

194
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
then he goes into like

195
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
launches up all his vms i've everybody

196
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
has seen you know when he does the demos

197
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,479
he's like yeah let me show you this

198
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,160
here's how i compromise it just by an

199
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
email and

200
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,319
the guy that was in charge of kind of a

201
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
vendor risk management program for this

202
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
big bank

203
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,520
he's like wow that is really cool i have

204
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,840
no idea what you did there but it looked

205
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,880
really cool you know uh with this uh

206
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,800
yeah it was it was pretty entertaining

207
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,080
like dave and i've had good

208
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,199
relationships and work

209
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,560
obviously you know working at trusted

210
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
sec here but um sometimes you get

211
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
customers that

212
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
they don't know exactly the industry

213
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
we're in and start you know

214
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
they're excited about and everything

215
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
which was uh uh great

216
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,000
um let's see what other stores i have

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
ah so this is one consulting

218
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,880
uh with this and pre-trusted sec again

219
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
back in older uh consulting days and one

220
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
of the things that we do

221
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,520
a lot is looking at programs you know so

222
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,400
helping them

223
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
compare to whatever framework it is

224
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,440
looking at all the

225
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
multitudes and everything like that so i

226
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,039
go into this one company

227
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,840
they're kind of construction industry

228
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,199
type of things so

229
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,840
smaller it footprint but still hundreds

230
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
of employees and everything like that

231
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,800
so we're going in kind of helping them

232
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
measuring against all these different uh

233
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,759
baselines and everything

234
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,479
the one thing that's a kind of off topic

235
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,680
i walk into the it

236
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,639
manager's office here it looked like an

237
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,160
all-purpose storage room you couldn't

238
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,759
even walk straight to his desk you had

239
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,160
to go

240
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,280
around the stacks of paper and books and

241
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,880
hardware and everything like that you

242
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,479
couldn't even sit down in his office it

243
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,240
was just stacked to the brim

244
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,759
of stuff like hoarder you know with that

245
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,360
but anyway we were talking i don't

246
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,440
really have a lot not a lot of policy

247
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,120
not a lot of baselining everything you

248
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,879
know what fine we work with a number of

249
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,639
customers with that

250
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,520
uh later i was talking with the cio of

251
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,199
business condoning

252
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
and we're talking about it and what

253
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,639
they're doing with that and how they

254
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,560
were backing up and all that stuff

255
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,280
and he goes in and he says justin i see

256
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
one of your topics is policies

257
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,599
procedures

258
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,840
like yeah that's right you don't really

259
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
have a lot you have an employee handbook

260
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
but that's about it and he's like yeah

261
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,960
we have policies i was like oh okay

262
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,759
i wasn't aware that he reaches into his

263
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,520
desk or pulls out a folder called

264
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
auditing and lays it in front of me

265
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,240
i open it up and they're beautiful

266
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,879
policies well-written

267
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,080
well-articulated content it's full you

268
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,680
know the stuff you're expecting to look

269
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,399
out of that

270
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,479
and i'm flipping it's like wow these are

271
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,760
great policies

272
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,240
are they implemented in here the he's

273
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
like oh no

274
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,279
that'd be too expensive to implement

275
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,880
here

276
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,120
and and of course i'm like right in my

277
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,720
notes i was like these coffee

278
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,160
policies are definitely copied from

279
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
somewhere you know type of thing

280
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,959
um it was and again you know trying to

281
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,080
hold back laughter

282
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
being professional and uh but yeah it's

283
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
pretty played with that

284
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,719
um

285
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,519
all right how about a pci story here and

286
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,560
it's not one

287
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
from being a qsa but on the other side

288
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
of the table we're being audited by qsa

289
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,360
so uh the parts of that at

290
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
dibold we actually had a number of stuff

291
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,880
where we actually manage

292
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,519
uh card order data for customers so once

293
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,440
a year getting a whole pci audit so we

294
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
can attest to that as a service provider

295
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,279
um the qsa came in and

296
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,519
back in the day especially they were

297
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,640
less required to be

298
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
certified and less required to be

299
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
knowledgeable so this guy came more from

300
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,519
the physical security end of it which is

301
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,040
fine but when we're dealing with

302
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,080
mainframes he was

303
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,200
way out of his depth didn't know one way

304
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,160
from another from

305
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
talking about mainframes and that is

306
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
where a lot of our cardholder data was

307
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
so we bring in the engineer to talk to

308
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,839
him start talking about

309
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,360
how are you encrypting it how are you

310
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
you know keeping it secure all that

311
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,600
stuff

312
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
and this guy wasn't the sharpest tool in

313
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,680
the shed

314
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
and both of them were talking and

315
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
everything and the q say yes

316
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
can you show me where card order data is

317
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,000
stored on the mainframe

318
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
you know it's pretty straight forward

319
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,920
answer very typical qsa

320
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,200
the uh the guy in charge says

321
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
i have no i can't show you where carter

322
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
data is stored it could be

323
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,279
anywhere on the platter that card order

324
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,680
data is actually stored on this

325
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,040
and the qsa was kind of lost he's like

326
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
oh

327
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,959
and just kind of fell quiet i'm on the

328
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,079
other side of the table

329
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,600
i'm like this i'm like i think he means

330
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,920
the file path where the cardholder data

331
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
is actually

332
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,079
so i had to explain he's like yeah

333
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
that's that's what i mean

334
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
and he's like oh yeah i can show you

335
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
that

336
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,200
so yeah it's uh sometimes you kind of

337
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,680
have to

338
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
lead people through um what you think is

339
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,440
uh

340
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,640
what you expect another qsa story i love

341
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
usa stores

342
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
and this is by a very large qsa company

343
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
i won't name names but they're kind of

344
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,320
really big in the industry

345
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
so my last company at gift cards we were

346
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,839
both

347
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,040
a card issuer like we stored track data

348
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,399
because we're printing

349
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
mag stripe cards going out of our

350
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,839
bidding uh building

351
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
plus we dealt with millions upon

352
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,000
millions of transactions to load up all

353
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,560
the cards

354
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
i mean we sold money essentially you

355
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
know from that

356
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,399
and so we basically had a rock that

357
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,040
basically

358
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
covered both the service provider aspect

359
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
and the um

360
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,160
um and the um uh the merchant side

361
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,440
of it so both sides of this the qsa came

362
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,000
in

363
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
literally for two hours that's it for

364
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
all this stuff he came in literally for

365
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,040
two hours

366
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
and one of the things as we just

367
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
mentioned he asked about where you store

368
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,079
cardholder data i was like okay

369
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,760
great i'll pull up the database and

370
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
let's uh take a look at cardholder data

371
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,639
and you know bring it up it was a maria

372
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,120
dv

373
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
so mysql kind of base and everything and

374
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,680
had a tool that basically loaded up and

375
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,959
all the tables

376
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,040
and where we stored card order data it

377
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,399
was all that binary

378
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,160
kind of rendering so it was all the

379
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
weird characters and everything like

380
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,240
that

381
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
it's like you know as you can see here

382
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,279
you know

383
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,040
unless you can and of course i'm being

384
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,959
funny here unless you can read wingdings

385
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,160
you won't be able to

386
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,959
read this card data and the qsa said to

387
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:23,600
me

388
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
oh that's wingdings there

389
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
and i'm like no that's that's binary

390
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,519
data trying to be rendered on the screen

391
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,760
so after he left after two hours um i

392
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,600
went into our ip office i was like

393
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
guys i got a great new solution

394
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
we're going to switch all of our card

395
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
data to wingdings and that's our

396
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
encryption strategy from now on

397
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,079
nobody will know uh type of bag so

398
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,560
yeah it's uh it's always entertaining

399
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
with that

400
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,920
um anymore

401
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,079
[Music]

402
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,040
and i have some other stories they took

403
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,399
a little bit longer to

404
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
kind of go through but uh we'll call it

405
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
we'll call it for a talk any questions i

406
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
don't know if you have any questions for

407
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,519
me

408
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,120
yeah yes it did work very well

409
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,399
of course we didn't spend a lot of money

410
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,839
on our qsa's and i think that was

411
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,560
purposeful

412
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
so all right thanks everyone have a

413
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,650
