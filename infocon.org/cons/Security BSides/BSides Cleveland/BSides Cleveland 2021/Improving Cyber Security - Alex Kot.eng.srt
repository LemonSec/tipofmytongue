so before i kick it off a quick

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,520
disclaimer i'm gonna talk about things

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
uh maybe legal things related to my

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,119
industry and health care but i am not a

33
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,878
legal expert or a

34
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,160
health care professional per se um so

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,480
um feel free to always you know reach

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,000
out to your company internally for any

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
type of legal advice

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,879
but i'll be going through things that

39
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
i've experienced in my environment

40
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,000
and from there hopefully it helps out

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,480
the uh

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
infosec community out there so the

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
overall part of this talk will be kind

44
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:28,720
of

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
just to talk about how to prove the uh

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,000
hate to use a term cyber

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,879
security landscape but the biggest

48
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,080
problem that everyone has

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,720
in this field is that there's no degrees

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,680
there's no

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
asserts or training to actually run a

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,200
cyber security program

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
there's ones out there that'll talk

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,319
about how to be a cso but

55
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
none of those really work there's so

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
many pitfalls that you come across when

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,800
it comes to understanding budgeting

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,720
working with executive leadership

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,120
and all the talks that are out there

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
they don't really work that well because

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
fundamentally when we get into those

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
situations you have to kind of figure

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
out those things out on the fly

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
so this talk is geared towards more uh

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
people that are going to become security

66
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
officers in the future

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
but additionally everyone because i

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,159
treat my employees the same way that i

69
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,879
expect

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,080
them to treat me um so i want them to

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
you know collaborate with me i want them

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,519
to tell me if i did wrong

73
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
and i expect other security officers out

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
there it's uh something that i really

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,879
enjoy about this industry which i

76
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
haven't seen in many other places that

77
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,080
there's a lot of humble people out there

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
i mean there's obviously

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
here in the badges well not that but the

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,159
wristband so to speak

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,879
you know we encourage hugs and community

82
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,480
collaboration things like that

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,920
which isn't as common in other

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,560
industries so i i feel like this is uh

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
something that this industry needs to

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
stick to and keep going that direction

87
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,319
and uh especially when you're up in the

88
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,959
leadership

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,760
roles um you know helping out the rest

90
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
of the organization you need to

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,799
make sure even during tough times during

92
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,159
instant response to stay humble that

93
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,680
whole time

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
all this material free field or reuse

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,959
but

96
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
what i talk about may work with you may

97
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
not your mileage may vary

98
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
but uh really want to make sure the

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
industry gets better from things that

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,959
i've seen

101
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,840
uh so that you don't have to be uh one

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
of those people whereas uh

103
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
we take seriously or we take security

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
very seriously

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,680
however uh that type of scenario were

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
that the leaders in the organization

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,120
aren't able to work with the other

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
leaders to kind of

109
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,400
push that needle to build a proper cyber

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
security program

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
so i am um my title currently is the avp

112
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,400
of cyber security

113
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
uh at avianna we're uh the largest

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,680
pediatric

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
uh healthcare provider which when it in

116
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,199
the grand picture of it we're still

117
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,400
pretty small compared to the rest of the

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
healthcare industry

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
we recently went public so if you want

120
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
to know about our financial information

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
and it's out there on the internet now

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,080
the company is uh from especially if you

123
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,919
read over the sec statement

124
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,800
very rapid m a we've grown about double

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,520
every year

126
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,199
for the last five years which is quite

127
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,440
insane for most people especially

128
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
uh when you talk to other organizations

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
about acquisitions and technical debt

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,479
that acquire from that

131
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,919
but we were able to tackle a lot of that

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,840
stuff i worked in uh

133
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
financial tech particularly payment

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,039
processing

135
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
retail banking healthcare i'm an

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,400
engineer by trade

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,280
i am not a manager or leader by any

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
means

139
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
highly introvert but what it comes down

140
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
to is that if you have enough passion

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
and you try to go into that um

142
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,199
eventually you kind of overcome all

143
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,600
those

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
issues um so what i'm saying is that if

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,360
anybody wants to actually be

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,639
better in the industry and help out

147
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,160
other people it doesn't matter if you're

148
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
introvert like i am

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
or you know your people skills kind of

150
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
suck you'll be able to adapt and grow

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,240
and if i could do anybody else can

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,639
so uh speaking of titles because i i

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,000
always refer to myself as

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,759
i run the cyber security program at

155
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,280
avianna i don't

156
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
uh give myself a title per se uh and

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
that's one of the actual things that i

158
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
want to talk about because i see this in

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
a lot of other

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
um you know you go on the these uh cso

161
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,560
calls and stuff like that

162
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
and um they'll have different titles but

163
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
i don't think they really understand the

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
complications around that

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,199
so uh real quick show of hands so

166
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,479
everyone in this one two three uh are

167
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,639
are titled as cso like cso director of

168
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,039
security cso chief information security

169
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,120
uh cso vp of security and in there i

170
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
have a statement in there

171
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
with their how close they are to the

172
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,039
board whether it be you know to the ceo

173
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,759
or not

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
um who thinks number one is considered a

175
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,800
c sell

176
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,199
uh what about uh number two show of

177
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,440
hands i think they're a cso

178
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,720
and then number three do they think

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199
that's a c sale so the biggest problem

180
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,479
is that i see a lot of people out there

181
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,759
that are directors

182
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,680
that consider themselves csos but the

183
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
problem is most organizations

184
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
in order to be a fiduciary of the

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
organization you have to have a vp title

186
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,840
your signature doesn't really mean a

187
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,599
whole lot and when you're a director you

188
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,800
get in a little kind of a

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
sticky um you know situation signing off

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:56,880
on stuff

191
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
for the organization on behalf of as a

192
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
director not a vp of the organization

193
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
so even though if you do communicate

194
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,160
directly to the board you gotta be leery

195
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,120
of that stuff

196
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
more of this to save your own but in the

197
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
future but again

198
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
it's not legal advice please consult

199
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,080
your legal team but that's

200
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,599
something i see very common in the

201
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,759
industry because unfortunately

202
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,520
security is uh kind of a band-aid

203
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
approach in most organizations they pass

204
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,599
it on

205
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,599
after an incident so they don't want to

206
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
give a vp title in a lot of these

207
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,800
companies so then

208
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,919
they're just putting this person in

209
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,440
there for the time being hoping they can

210
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120
fix all the problems but you really need

211
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
to be part of the executive leadership

212
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,599
to kind of

213
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,759
steer that and grow that or part of the

214
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,160
program

215
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
so let's talk about the state of uh

216
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,599
cyber crime

217
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,240
uh some numbers that definitely kind of

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,039
uh

219
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,879
make you kind of question if you want to

220
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,160
stay on the good side because how

221
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,919
profitable it is on the other side but

222
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,520
luckily like i said at the beginning a

223
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
lot of the people initially are very

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,440
humble

225
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
uh there's always work so you're never

226
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,319
going to have issues you know finding

227
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,520
jobs in cyber security

228
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,960
additionally you know we just have good

229
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
codes of ethics hopefully everyone in

230
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,360
here

231
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
but um data breaches are extremely

232
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,039
expensive

233
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,520
especially when it comes to ransomware a

234
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
good one that happened recently was a

235
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,800
universal health

236
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,759
services the biggest problem is that i

237
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,000
would

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,039
say probably less than 50 of ransomware

239
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,160
instances

240
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
actually go public there's a lot of

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,599
stuff that go under the radar that

242
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,680
they're not uh legally obligated to

243
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,199
disclose it

244
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
so um to get numbers is hard because

245
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,280
they're not always out there

246
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,960
additionally to get numbers of the

247
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,879
operational impact because ransomware is

248
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
different than business email compromise

249
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,279
ransomware you'll have operational

250
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,360
outages you'll have potential customer

251
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,000
losses

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
brand damaging more so than a business

253
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,519
email compromise

254
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,958
and i'll talk a little bit more about

255
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
both of those and uh later on slides

256
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
but in here they they are particularly

257
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
stated which is a little bit more rare

258
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,160
uh on their uh scc-10q so when you when

259
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
you go public you have to do 10 queues

260
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,720
in 10ks

261
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
and in there you basically have to state

262
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
financial uh

263
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,720
significant damages that will affect the

264
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
shareholders

265
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
and in there they had to call out the

266
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
fact that they had a three week outage

267
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,920
from ransomware

268
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,120
and it resulted in 67 million dollars of

269
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,279
damages uh granted they didn't have the

270
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,880
number of breakdowns so i don't know

271
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
if that is you know some of it's taken

272
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
by cyber liability insurance which

273
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
i would say probably less than half

274
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,839
knowing how most of those things work

275
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,519
um but it is an interesting thing

276
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,959
because you don't realize it until it

277
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,839
happens

278
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,080
and i i would say this one particular i

279
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
i found very fascinating when you if you

280
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
would go on a reddit threads during this

281
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,080
time

282
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,519
because they didn't really go public

283
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,560
about it i think it happened on like

284
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
sunday at 2 a.m

285
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
and then they didn't have a public

286
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,120
statement until maybe either tuesday or

287
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,399
maybe monday evening

288
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,760
but if you look at the reddit threads

289
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,279
there's people in there saying that

290
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,040
there's a computer outage

291
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,000
we had a transfer er patient from this

292
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
hospital another one

293
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,240
we're not even sure if they're going to

294
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
make it so that that that fact is just

295
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
you know i hate to say it there's a for

296
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
people that do things like this for

297
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,080
ransomware and for healthcare for

298
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
critical people out there

299
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,959
there's definitely a special place in

300
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,320
health for people that do things like

301
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,959
that

302
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,800
but it really shows you the bigger

303
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,480
picture of

304
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
you know the the emotional state the

305
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,920
impact

306
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
and you could go on reddit view those

307
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
threads at that time and it

308
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,360
definitely kind of shows that picture um

309
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
if you dealt with ir

310
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,279
you know you definitely see it and just

311
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
the it staff and

312
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,760
the executive leaderships too um the

313
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,480
other thing

314
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
um is uh which this number came out

315
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
recently

316
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,519
uh this is the same group that did the

317
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,279
colonial pipeline when the ransomware

318
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,360
for about 4.4 million unlike what

319
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,480
bloomberg said it was

320
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
4.4 million um the dark side

321
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,000
uh they tracked all the bitcoin

322
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
addresses to the dark side

323
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,399
total of 47 victims and i think there's

324
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,000
really only two major ones it was like

325
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,079
colonial pipeline and then some

326
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,839
a gas company in germany i'm sure

327
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,040
there's other ones but those were kind

328
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,160
of the ones that are out there but

329
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
there's total 47

330
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
within nine months they made 90 million

331
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
dollars uh and there's probably

332
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
almost a staff of five people i wouldn't

333
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,720
be surprised

334
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
i don't think there's any industry out

335
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,279
there that are is that you know

336
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,200
that many people and that much profit so

337
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
to speak it's very scary and

338
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,120
then i'll talk later on about it but the

339
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,959
ransomware is becoming worse and worse

340
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,680
it's not going away uh ugly situations

341
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
to deal with it and i'll kind of

342
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
give my two cents on how to actually

343
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,120
publicly fix that

344
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
hopefully that that would you know go

345
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,399
down that road but also

346
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
another thing and this helps out with

347
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,079
your executive leaders personal

348
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,519
liability does happen

349
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,160
so during the acquisition from verizon

350
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,519
and yahoo

351
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,240
they had uncovered a data breach they

352
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
also use that during the m

353
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,320
a acquisition to lessen the the cost for

354
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
yahoo and verizon

355
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,519
had a better deal but because of that

356
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,640
the shareholders

357
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,800
uh what's called shareholder uh

358
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
derivative lawsuit

359
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,760
basically means that the the

360
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,160
shareholders ended up holding personal

361
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
liability to the executives from the

362
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,040
people from wahoo

363
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
or yahoo so it was basically 29 million

364
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
dollars

365
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,200
so there's not a whole lot of cases out

366
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,959
there but it does happen

367
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,360
so it it kind of reinforces that you

368
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
know the executive teams they

369
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
they want to have that buy-in because if

370
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
you show that level of support

371
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,839
it helps protect them in the long run

372
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,240
but in general ransomware and book this

373
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
email compromise are both

374
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
billion dollar industries i would say

375
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,120
ransomware may not be at a billion yet

376
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,800
it probably is it's hard to track a lot

377
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
of that information because it's not

378
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,120
always out there

379
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
um but it's definitely billions of

380
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,240
damages

381
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,200
uh and then one thing i noted uh from

382
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,920
just seeing

383
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,760
the ones that do state the operational

384
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
impact versus the ransomware payout

385
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
a general rule of thumb is that if you

386
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,959
pay 4 million

387
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,720
in ransomware you're going to have about

388
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,079
40 million in damages

389
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
about 10 times for most of the numbers

390
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
i've seen this is

391
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
all opinionated because it's not really

392
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,079
a whole lot of detail out there about

393
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,240
that but that's something to think about

394
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,040
it's not just

395
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
the payments that you normally see it's

396
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,480
the more of the damages when it comes to

397
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,160
that

398
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,839
so um the cyber security is a

399
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,120
super complex issue um as i'm sure

400
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
everyone in this room that deals with

401
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,440
ir the attacker methods get more and

402
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
more complex every month i remember

403
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
uh dealing with early ransomware a

404
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,639
cryptolocker in

405
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,720
2014 i think some around there and i was

406
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,639
dumped out at how sophisticated it was

407
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,160
and that was just the tip of the iceberg

408
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
at that time because that's before they

409
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,440
started doing targeting they had

410
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,040
uh people that probably actually looked

411
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,720
at the economics of the companies and

412
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,040
seen

413
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
how much they grant them it was their

414
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,079
shotgun approach they used a lot of

415
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,760
action script and other things

416
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
but it was just you know somebody opened

417
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
up a pdf document and then the first

418
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,480
thing it did is it ran

419
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,560
and looked at network map drives and

420
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
encrypted all the files

421
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
but he used tor which was newer at that

422
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,440
time it was really cool because like

423
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
it sucked because it like seeing that

424
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
stuff and i'm like oh crap now i'm gonna

425
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,360
ruin the rest of my day but at the same

426
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,040
time seeing the level of sophistication

427
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
on using tor

428
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
how to anonymize it i was like i was

429
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680
dumped on them like these guys actually

430
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,600
are pretty smart whoever does this

431
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,880
unfortunately they're on the bad side

432
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,519
but that was in 2014

433
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,360
now you have groups like ryuk that

434
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
started um actually sam sam is another

435
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,320
one

436
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
starting with probably around 2016 to

437
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,440
more of the

438
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
after like 2018 but they started using

439
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,360
more like red team tactics

440
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
um they're not getting to the point with

441
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,720
uh nation stage sponsors with

442
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
living off the land but their their

443
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
attack methods are

444
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
getting a lot more complex where they're

445
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,440
looking for vulnerabilities they have

446
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,920
custom

447
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
tools that they exploit versus shotgun

448
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,720
approach they look at the economics

449
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,120
where

450
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
okay this company has public information

451
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,199
that they're a billion dollars in

452
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,000
revenue

453
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
they could then ransomware for this much

454
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,440
money and they actually have a

455
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
negotiation system

456
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,399
it gets really interesting without that

457
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,800
whole thing um

458
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,040
but the the other problem though beyond

459
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
just the fact that

460
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,959
these attackers are getting more

461
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,480
sophisticated they're they're getting

462
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
more profitable

463
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
uh the judicial system out there uh

464
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,720
can't really agree on what's defined and

465
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
the laws can't even keep up with it i

466
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,680
mean they're really the only law that's

467
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
out there is computer fraud and abuse

468
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,519
act

469
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,079
which means jet crap when it comes to

470
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,959
the uh

471
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
countries like russia iran and other

472
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,240
countries that are outside of interpol's

473
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
jurisdiction so yeah you could have

474
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
computer fraud and abuse act but you're

475
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,680
not going to arrest anybody in russia

476
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
you have to go through the diplomatic

477
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,079
ways and

478
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,199
they're probably just going to keep a

479
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
blind eye because they're making profit

480
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,199
and

481
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,440
there's other reasons behind it uh but

482
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
even internally with our own lawsuits

483
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,519
it's really hard to justify like what is

484
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,639
you know uh

485
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,759
i know there's all these different

486
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,120
states they're trying to make their own

487
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
mini cc

488
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,360
uh computer fraud and abuse act uh type

489
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,079
of law

490
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,920
and they they really can't agree on it

491
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,199
it makes things worse

492
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,399
ends up kind of pissing out some

493
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,399
companies and they end up like thinking

494
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,920
about leaving that area so then they

495
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,199
realize okay

496
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
incorporating this laws and i'm gonna

497
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
hurt our uh state more than actually

498
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,320
helpful

499
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,279
so it is a kind of a interesting thing

500
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,720
and when you talk to

501
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,360
lawyers out there in the industry most

502
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,839
of them

503
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,040
don't know what is like

504
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
happening in the market a lot of them

505
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
are dealing with that post-mortem and

506
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,839
they're trying to be adaptive and

507
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,360
there's nothing to do against you know

508
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
lawyers are out there

509
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,120
uh the problem is that they don't teach

510
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,759
this stuff

511
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,440
in colleges and i don't even think they

512
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
teach it right now so you can get your

513
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,079
bar

514
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,680
but you won't have to know about you

515
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
know cybercrime or it's a response

516
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,680
yet more and more of these lawyers are

517
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,600
being pulled into this and talking to

518
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,079
some

519
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,680
ones that are specialized in cyber

520
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
security none of them actually get

521
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,880
training on it they only

522
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,040
get that knowledge from the fact that

523
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
they're dealt with enough

524
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,839
instances that they became kind of

525
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,360
subject matter experts

526
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,720
because they're able to analyze and

527
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
figure it out but there is no like

528
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
playbooks around this stuff for lawyers

529
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,279
it's all postmortem

530
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,720
and that's the kind of scary thing is

531
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
that you know the people that are

532
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,040
legally defending our country really

533
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
don't know what to do

534
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,920
but one thing that seems to matter when

535
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,360
it comes to

536
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,959
kind of building a program internally in

537
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,720
your organization

538
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
one is duty of care that is definitely

539
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,160
used a lot in lawsuits that are out

540
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,720
there

541
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
and it's simple terms this space means

542
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,839
executive buy-in

543
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,319
um and i'll talk about it um later on

544
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,839
but uh cyber security steering committee

545
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,760
is what i created in my organization

546
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,439
it helps create a charter seeing that

547
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,720
they have to attend this once a month

548
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,400
and we do many things to help kind of

549
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,000
the organization beyond just helping

550
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
them you know defend against cyber

551
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
security but also awareness around other

552
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,480
things too

553
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,400
um evidence of a growth of cyber

554
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,079
security program and when i say growth i

555
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,679
don't mean like spend a million dollars

556
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,600
and next year spend two million dollars

557
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,480
it's constant growth in the sense of we

558
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
engineered these solutions we

559
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
we did system hardening here we we did

560
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
patch management

561
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
we have better procedures in there we

562
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
have better playbooks

563
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
you don't have to increase your funds to

564
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,160
actually grow

565
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,360
the cybersecurity program but um if you

566
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,799
have any evidence of the

567
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,520
the program being stagnant or maybe a

568
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,559
lot of these

569
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,919
the leadership from the cyber security

570
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,360
teams leave and they're not able to

571
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,400
refill that with

572
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
proper staff and an instant happens they

573
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,480
can use that in lawsuits and

574
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,360
um and it has been shown so that is a

575
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
definitely a thing that

576
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
most people that run these programs they

577
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
want to make sure they show evidence of

578
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,880
that

579
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
however you do that it doesn't have to

580
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,280
be metrics it just has to show that some

581
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,679
growth of it whether it be adding more

582
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,240
tools or programs

583
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,840
the other thing which isn't really used

584
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,600
a whole lot in court cases but i

585
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,280
think this is something that should be

586
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,919
done uh response time relative to the

587
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,880
industry

588
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
it's a hard number because nobody wants

589
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
to publicly talk about it

590
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,679
and verizon database um verizon has a

591
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,679
data breach

592
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,799
response report every year and they show

593
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,640
kind of some numbers which is kind of

594
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,080
loosely opinionated but if the industry

595
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,200
starts taking a

596
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
stance on you know responding to this

597
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,320
better

598
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
then the the people like the ransomware

599
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
groups will become less profitable

600
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,080
and if they make lawsuits to hell hold

601
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,679
these companies accountable

602
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,799
for negligence and and having a very

603
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,200
very low bar when it comes to that i

604
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
honestly think that will help kind of

605
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
push that industry

606
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,280
towards a a better way of doing things

607
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,760
um as i mentioned uh executive biom's a

608
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,720
huge thing

609
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,000
i created a cyber security steering

610
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,120
committee in my organization um

611
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,600
with that in that committee i don't not

612
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,039
only just talk about you know

613
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
things that we incorporated new

614
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
engineering new tools

615
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,039
uh new metrics or things that are out

616
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
there but also talk about

617
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,080
just overall like things that we're

618
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,679
going to be pushing out there and get

619
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,120
like pilot groups

620
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,600
for um you know potential operational

621
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,160
things

622
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,360
because the the problem with

623
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,679
cybersecurity tools that some of them

624
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,760
will require a little bit of tlc like

625
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,200
your multi-factor authentication is a

626
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,600
huge one which i'll talk about later on

627
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,440
you're definitely going to have some

628
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
issues around implementing that because

629
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
a lot of people just don't like that

630
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,919
extra burden

631
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,679
but when you look at the the grand

632
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,960
picture of it it is an

633
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
awesome win if you're able to

634
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,960
incorporate that to the whole enterprise

635
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,039
the other thing is a collaboration and

636
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,640
transparency with your legal team

637
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,559
compliance team and internal audit

638
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,559
not not all companies have you know

639
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,000
dedicated teams to that sometimes they

640
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,120
outsource legal

641
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,880
some companies don't have internal audit

642
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,320
some companies don't aren't really

643
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,440
compliance driven

644
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
but if you're able to if you have those

645
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
parts of the organization you're able to

646
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
coordinate with them they'll be your

647
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,480
biggest advocate

648
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
when it comes to a lot of these issues

649
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,280
down the road that you'll come across

650
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,799
with instant response

651
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,120
and anytime you talk to anybody like

652
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,880
legal or compliance

653
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,799
they're always there to help support it

654
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,000
they're just as lost

655
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,280
as everyone else out there in the

656
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,360
industry but if you're able to sit down

657
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
with them and kind of show them some

658
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,919
scenarios and explain

659
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,360
why you're doing this or why we're going

660
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,679
this approach they never push back and

661
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,280
that's one thing that i think a lot of

662
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
leaders in cyber security kind of fail

663
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
on is that

664
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
just take that initial step to go

665
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
communicate with them and get that kind

666
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
of baseline and once you do that

667
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,559
it's it's so much easier um and then

668
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,320
the other thing is budget smart i've

669
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
seen way too many companies

670
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,200
that do this where they they either let

671
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,080
their vendor

672
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,480
do the choices for them or they they

673
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
spend all the money on a particular

674
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,600
thing like some companies have seen like

675
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
spend all their money on identity access

676
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,080
management

677
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,600
which is great you know you want to make

678
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,440
sure the accounts have rotation and

679
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
privilege access is done right

680
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,400
but at the same time that may not matter

681
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
when during uh like somebody gets

682
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
ransomware you know

683
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,320
if they get credits to an account and

684
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
they're able to then create their own

685
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,799
accounts you don't have a sim to

686
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,320
actually detect that

687
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,760
putting all your money in one area is

688
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,520
not going to help kind of resolve that

689
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,559
so when you uh build a program and

690
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,080
and i i was fortunate enough to

691
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,600
greenfield my whole cybersecurity

692
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,320
program it's

693
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,720
definitely a rarity in the industry but

694
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,240
um even so

695
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,880
when you you know adopt a cyber security

696
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,520
program

697
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,039
you could you still look at it as a

698
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,799
holistic view and then plan

699
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
on in the future what are the gaps that

700
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,320
you're missing

701
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
and you want to make sure that that

702
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,400
budget is properly because um

703
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,679
you know it's like cyber security is

704
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,080
really

705
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,520
like a human body it's a complex

706
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,799
organism there's so many different

707
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,679
things you got all these different

708
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,960
organs that rely on

709
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
other parts and if you don't build the

710
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,480
program to kind of

711
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,039
you know do uh which i'll talk a little

712
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
more on the the bigger ones but like

713
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,919
multi-factor

714
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,039
uh email gateway uh uh

715
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,320
vulnerability management if you don't

716
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,919
have all those different pieces done

717
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,039
properly

718
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,200
it's gonna bite you in the button long

719
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,320
long term

720
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,720
um the other thing is uh always always

721
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
plan for change

722
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,110
um basically

723
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,240
[Music]

724
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,679
when you go talk to your like cfo

725
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,840
or your your other leaders in the

726
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
organization

727
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,520
it's really hard to get uh like

728
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,720
additional budget

729
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,400
uh people don't realize because i see

730
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,799
ted talks about the ted talks like of uh

731
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,840
you know talking about

732
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,520
building a cyber security program and

733
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,200
you go up them and show them like

734
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,440
oh here's all the risks and the impact

735
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,559
it will cost

736
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,200
generally that doesn't work the cfo is

737
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,720
not going to be like oh yeah that sounds

738
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,240
great let me go ahead and call the uh

739
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,360
the banks or

740
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,799
talk to the equity partner and pull line

741
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,720
of credit because of that that rarely

742
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,600
happens

743
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
you have to kind of plant those seeds

744
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
and grow with it where you have to

745
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,360
explain

746
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,240
the risk and maybe wait until uh you

747
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
know your cfo has a particular project

748
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,320
where you can fit that into the budget

749
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,559
um it doesn't happen overnight and then

750
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,919
that's the thing that a lot of people

751
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,360
that fail when they want to build a

752
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
program they think they could

753
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,440
talk about you know the the security

754
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,679
theater all the the shock and awe

755
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,039
and then they'll instantly get budget

756
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,960
because of that it really works that way

757
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
you gotta partner with your cfo you

758
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,520
gotta you know explain the risks

759
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
and if the risk happened during that at

760
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
least you you know have it in email

761
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,880
format and you're able to move forward

762
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,400
and act on it

763
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,880
sometimes uh companies will do that

764
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
where they won't

765
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,240
spend money until post incident and

766
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,159
that's very common in the industry

767
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,880
um but if you partner with your cfo and

768
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,840
explain this

769
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,799
you're able to you know and if you're

770
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,720
lucky enough not to have an incident

771
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
usually at the end of the year for the

772
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
budget you're able to grow that i i

773
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
was able to grow organically but most

774
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,360
people i know

775
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
uh end up getting most of their budget

776
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
after a major incident which is kind of

777
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
a sad state with the industry but

778
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
i can't blame them because when you talk

779
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,120
to the cfo they have a set line

780
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
you know that they have to hit for

781
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
budget and if you cross that line

782
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,000
that requires them to talk to the equity

783
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,919
partners or the banks and pull lines of

784
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,400
credit

785
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,279
it's not as simple as most people think

786
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,240
and then when you're building your

787
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,600
program out

788
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,760
always phase it out i've seen people do

789
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,279
this too where they're

790
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,919
just instantly gonna shove all the tools

791
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,520
buy all the tools at once

792
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,720
you're gonna fail because you're not

793
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,080
gonna have the right staff you're gonna

794
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
be bothering your infrastructure team

795
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,360
all at once you're gonna

796
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,520
have too many hurdles and then it gets

797
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
to the point where then you forget about

798
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
these tools i've seen a lot of companies

799
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,919
do failed projects in the past because

800
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,840
they try to do all at once because

801
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,320
a post breach and the different teams

802
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,919
get overwhelmed and they're not able to

803
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,919
go back and resolve it

804
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,559
another thing is and i i think this has

805
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,840
to do with kind of uh

806
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
sox regulations cobit and a few other

807
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,960
things but uh

808
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
there's a lot of barriers that are seen

809
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,240
in certain industries and i'm i'm a

810
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
component of knocking down those walls

811
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,840
i feel like my analysts and engineers

812
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,279
should be the same people if they want

813
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,960
to collaborate and do their own thing

814
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
i have no idea why that some of these

815
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
companies think separation duty is a

816
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,679
mandate

817
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,720
mandatory thing but um in it does

818
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,679
when i say separation duty it's not like

819
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,520
you know separating accounts and

820
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,080
rules of responsibility makes sense but

821
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,679
they they some of these companies view

822
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,400
it as that

823
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,159
analysts can't talk to engineers they

824
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,919
can't get on a zoom session

825
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,000
and show what the engineers do and the

826
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,679
analysts like oh yeah that's definitely

827
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,679
that's that's that those alerts are my

828
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,120
biggest problem

829
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,279
that is very common and i i never

830
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,640
understood in the industry but

831
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,840
we really need to encourage that

832
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,679
behavior where you have them kind of

833
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,480
collaborate

834
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,840
because there is a lot of false

835
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
positives in most of the tools out there

836
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,880
and if you're able to

837
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,200
get rid of that stuff your team's so

838
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,520
more so much more efficient

839
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,039
and the other thing is and i hate kind

840
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,360
of the buzzwordy

841
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,520
feel of happy feeling but you really

842
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,120
want to take people on a journey

843
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,720
we do this all the time in my company

844
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,559
where i get different teams out there

845
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,279
like a clinical team or the network

846
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,159
admins

847
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,000
and we we take them and kind of

848
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,919
collaborate with our offensive security

849
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,960
or defensive

850
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
but we show them the realistic side

851
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,880
because once you kind of walk through

852
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,240
somebody a scenario

853
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,400
what it really looks like they stop

854
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,279
questioning things

855
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,279
they're they're your biggest advocate

856
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,880
and it does take

857
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
some extra time you know you're taking a

858
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
few hours your day to go work with the

859
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,159
different people out there you got to

860
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,400
also retail your your terms and

861
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
information to the the people that may

862
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,720
not know you know like sql injection and

863
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
cross-site scripting and all this stuff

864
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
but if you show that to them and i'll

865
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,520
come through and hey this is why this is

866
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,080
important

867
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,279
we're going to be spending some

868
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,440
development time we need you guys to

869
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,080
make sure that our collaboration when it

870
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,799
comes to

871
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,960
uh you know user testing you're there

872
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,919
with us

873
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,360
uh and they'll understand and they'll

874
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,440
agree and then you won't have pushback

875
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,279
but it's very simple but yet it's it's

876
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,559
very uncommon that i've seen in the

877
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,360
industry

878
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,080
i think it's just um there's a

879
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,520
overwhelming stigma

880
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,559
of security folks that are viewed as the

881
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,400
the the trolls in the basement that only

882
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,840
come up when they want to yell at you

883
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,520
for doing wrong and i really want to

884
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
break that in the industry

885
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,039
um kind of related image is uh

886
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,720
you know a lot of people kind of

887
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,279
talk about the the problems that they

888
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,159
wanna

889
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,960
fix and mitigate and um i never

890
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,720
understood the the pitfalls in a lot of

891
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,840
these companies because if you

892
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,279
partner with your infrastructure team

893
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,360
you partner with development and kind of

894
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,120
walk them through these scenarios

895
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,440
uh generally things will get done but

896
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
this is kind of a joke but there's an

897
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,000
overwhelming

898
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
amount this in the industry where people

899
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
will you know the the old man

900
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,200
screaming at the cloud saying you know

901
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,039
blah blah blah and then

902
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,000
nothing gets done but you know if you

903
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,799
collaborate

904
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,960
you'll end up being able to resolve most

905
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,279
of the issues

906
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,919
so let's talk about the uh uh two

907
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:04,399
biggest

908
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,120
uh concerns in the the corporations as i

909
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
mentioned already about ransomware

910
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,720
um that that is a overwhelming um

911
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,000
problem and it's not getting better and

912
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,240
i've you know i every time i thought

913
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,919
about something where it's like

914
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,919
man it would be horrible if they you

915
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,120
know target people

916
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,720
and then or use external like rdp

917
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,399
servers and things like that and then

918
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,440
they end up doing it

919
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
or it'll be horrible if they start

920
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,200
hitting vpn appliances because

921
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
pci is all about you know segmentation

922
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,799
and with multi-factor

923
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,799
but if you pop a vpn service you get

924
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,399
into their cde network

925
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,000
and you're able to compromise everything

926
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and that happened and then i and then i

927
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
was thinking well we'll be even worse if

928
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,039
they start excelling data

929
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,880
and then you're using that because some

930
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,279
people will be able to use backups

931
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,960
uh the other thing too a lot of people

932
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,520
don't realize when it comes to um

933
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,039
ransomware uh they they got the

934
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,840
um asset management down to a science a

935
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,600
lot of times when they compromise

936
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,919
they'll use like emoted and then the um

937
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,039
or keg tap or

938
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,799
wherever the new ones are and then

939
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,399
they'll compromise the network

940
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,919
and then they'll move they'll actually

941
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,440
start scanning and creating kind of an

942
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,399
inventory

943
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,000
and what they'll do is it's kind of like

944
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,679
a called a go live

945
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,600
script but they'll get to the point

946
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,120
where they'll know

947
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,240
when to pull the trigger because they

948
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,600
already got domain admin and a bunch of

949
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,320
other stuff

950
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,399
they'll know to when to stop the sql

951
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,919
servers when to then go

952
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,240
uh to the veeam server that had the same

953
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
credentials as their domain admin

954
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
and destroy all the backups and shadow

955
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,760
copies and that's something i'll talk

956
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,799
about in a second but

957
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,960
um you know people don't realize that

958
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,159
you got to look at

959
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,360
when you build your cyber security

960
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,640
program as what the attackers really do

961
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,919
the other thing is business email

962
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,080
compromise even though

963
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,679
that one's less devastating when it

964
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
comes to operational impact

965
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,760
it is extremely profitable fbi has a

966
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,120
report and i think they're

967
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,039
i would have to look it up but they're

968
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,360
they're in the like 20 billions of uh

969
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,720
revenue since 2013

970
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,399
tracking all this stuff now granted

971
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,840
there's a lot of other things that are

972
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,279
put in those numbers for business email

973
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
compromise such as like romance schemes

974
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,080
and whatnot

975
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,679
but uh another tactic that a lot of

976
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,799
these people do business email

977
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,760
compromise

978
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,919
they actually um will do uh direct

979
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,240
deposit override so if you have like adp

980
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,600
and they'll take those credentials that

981
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,279
they harvest and then log into those

982
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,600
platforms and update the direct deposit

983
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,440
and uh things that i've seen from other

984
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
people in the industry

985
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,760
they'll use like uh what they call meals

986
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
so essentially they will compromise uh

987
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,799
their

988
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,559
their system of where the the direct

989
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,159
deposit has been updated

990
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,399
it'll be sometimes a like an american

991
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,600
express or some uh

992
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,760
some bank company they'll funnel that

993
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,960
money and uh

994
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,080
and it's interesting because people

995
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,000
don't think about it until uh they look

996
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,399
at it

997
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,240
later on but uh and i wouldn't be

998
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
surprised it's correlated but there's

999
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,080
like craigslist ads and the signs on the

1000
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,640
highway

1001
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,520
like get money fast schemes i got a

1002
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,360
feeling a lot of those go towards

1003
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,600
those business email compromise groups

1004
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,640
and with

1005
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,960
those people are called meals where they

1006
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,159
basically take all the

1007
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,360
money that they excel from these

1008
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,440
companies for direct deposit overrides

1009
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,320
uh and then they will say hey go to this

1010
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,720
bank

1011
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
open up a uh account in the united

1012
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,399
states with your name

1013
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,640
uh keep a thousand bucks for yourself

1014
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,519
and then transfer

1015
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,519
twenty thousand dollars to a nigerian

1016
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,159
bank and then once it goes over to there

1017
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,679
uh it's out of our uh jurisdiction the

1018
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,120
money gets pulled instantly

1019
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,600
and getting it back unless fbi arrests a

1020
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,799
lot of those people and find a way to

1021
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,519
get it back

1022
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,000
you're kind of screwed and that's a very

1023
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,840
common thing with this email compromise

1024
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,039
you're not just trying to take your

1025
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,200
email address and then spam emails

1026
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,039
their end goal is financially motivated

1027
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,240
just like ransomware

1028
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,519
and it's more and more financially

1029
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,279
motivated and they they got it down to

1030
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,720
more of a science they know all the

1031
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,000
different payroll systems out

1032
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,679
there they know how to uh what types of

1033
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,240
phishing emails look more uh or more

1034
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,600
acceptable to people falling victim to

1035
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,799
so when it comes to those two big

1036
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,519
concerns and

1037
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,799
there's many other concerns when it

1038
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,720
comes to cyber security program but if

1039
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,919
you talk to any type of

1040
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,039
um you know ceo or whatnot they're

1041
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,640
they're losing sleep and cyber security

1042
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,159
because of ransomware they have friends

1043
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,200
that dealt with it

1044
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,960
they see in the media they don't want to

1045
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,640
be part of it um

1046
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,600
so but the biggest fix for a lot of

1047
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,080
stuff

1048
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,360
and and uh granted it's the program is a

1049
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,240
holistic view

1050
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,440
there's a lot of other things that are

1051
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,679
involved beyond this but when it comes

1052
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,679
to business email compromise

1053
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,600
two things email gateway multi-factor

1054
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,039
will pretty much

1055
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,519
stop majority of that if you're able to

1056
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,600
multi-factor enterprise-wide

1057
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,640
um the the the credential reuse is

1058
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,559
kind of gone i mean there are like the

1059
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,320
sophisticated tax but business

1060
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,960
compromise

1061
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,559
groups don't do that and the other thing

1062
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,559
too is that when you build this program

1063
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,519
you're not building it

1064
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,919
uh 100 protect you from everything

1065
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:50,640
you're

1066
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,159
you're you're trying to be the lowest

1067
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,159
threshold if you're if you're

1068
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,519
dealing with a ransomware group and

1069
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,360
you're able to stop them once they're

1070
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,640
going to move on they're not going to be

1071
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,679
persistent

1072
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,120
they're going to be like well this is

1073
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,799
too much effort i could go

1074
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,720
do this other company that doesn't have

1075
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,919
a security team

1076
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,200
and get a lot more money and i'm going

1077
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,960
to move the next target

1078
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,399
so that that's what you got to think

1079
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,480
about is how the attacker does stuff

1080
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,000
and also the um you know the um

1081
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,960
financial gains around it um but email

1082
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
gateway is a great thing i was talking

1083
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,679
to one of my

1084
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,240
buddies over there about that a few

1085
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,200
minutes ago

1086
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
but uh when it comes to that email

1087
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,080
gateway

1088
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,679
there's many different ways of doing it

1089
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,760
but the amount of effort you

1090
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,559
have uh when you set up improperly or

1091
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:36,960
you have

1092
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,240
a kind of a worse solution ever as it

1093
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,080
equates to a lot of time on the analyst

1094
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,120
and if you're able to engineer a

1095
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,679
solution

1096
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,640
properly it really helps and it cuts

1097
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,000
down a lot of the

1098
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,600
incident response because you're able to

1099
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,519
block it before that happens

1100
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,880
um asset and another thing is asset

1101
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,559
patch and vulnerability management

1102
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,000
now a lot of people out there will have

1103
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,320
different tools like qualis

1104
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,480
tenable and rapid saving expos

1105
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
for their vulnerability management which

1106
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,320
is definitely needed in a mature program

1107
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,359
but if your organization's able to have

1108
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,719
a team dedicated for

1109
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,399
asset management and has a good team

1110
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,239
that does like sem patches

1111
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,239
that is way better than a vulnerability

1112
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,520
management tool

1113
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,079
it just comes down to you need to have

1114
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,199
if you do have that vulnerability

1115
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,239
management tool

1116
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,760
you need to have that collaboration with

1117
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,520
your infrastructure team and if you

1118
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,879
don't have that

1119
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,839
you're not going to do anything i've

1120
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,359
seen too many people where they just

1121
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,800
keep handing them reports and nothing

1122
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,440
gets done

1123
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,199
i'm like well then have you sat down

1124
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,040
with them and talked them through

1125
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,879
why this is concerned have you got your

1126
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,239
red team to show them how

1127
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,239
ugly this looks like when it happens no

1128
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,359
it never happens

1129
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,960
but so if you're spending all this money

1130
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,239
on vulnerability management you're not

1131
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,280
getting anywhere just

1132
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
get rid of it and then work with your

1133
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,599
infrastructure team you probably have

1134
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,800
better results that way

1135
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,960
but ultimately that that is what helps a

1136
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,079
lot with this stuff

1137
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,599
um and um the other thing is the uh

1138
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,000
edr solution now in here i actually do

1139
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,040
not have sim

1140
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,359
which there's a reason i have not in

1141
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,160
there

1142
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,200
sim is extremely important but edr

1143
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,599
is something that there's no really a

1144
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,040
regulation out there

1145
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,800
that mandates it and it's definitely one

1146
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,160
of the bigger wins when it comes to that

1147
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,599
stuff especially ransomware because they

1148
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,119
get a lot more sophisticated

1149
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,599
and edr products basically look at the

1150
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,440
child parent process and how they

1151
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,599
execute and especially when you get into

1152
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,119
more of the sophisticated stuff like

1153
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,200
living off the land where they're using

1154
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,240
native windows tools to laterally remove

1155
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,680
um you can't get that with sim or any

1156
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,400
other av

1157
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,480
solution there's no solution other than

1158
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,760
edr that will fix a lot of that stuff

1159
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,839
the other thing is you know properly

1160
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,359
configured backups everyone talks about

1161
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,240
backups

1162
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
people say oh you need to have off-site

1163
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,560
backups what it comes down to is you got

1164
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:50,960
to think

1165
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,839
how the attacker works uh there's a um

1166
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,680
and i'll post it on twitter if you

1167
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,839
at the end if you look it up but there's

1168
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,359
a video of

1169
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,520
a school that's out there that dealt

1170
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,960
with ransomware that publicly talked

1171
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
about it and they were their veeam was

1172
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,599
impacted

1173
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,960
and what it came down to is that um the

1174
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
password was the same there and the

1175
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,000
worst part is they

1176
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,079
had off-site backups of the veeam but

1177
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,520
when they ransomware them

1178
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,839
they did it during the time that uh it

1179
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,359
was sinking to the off-site so the

1180
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,359
outsides got corrupted

1181
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,440
so um what what it comes down to is

1182
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,599
the easiest fix is don't have the same

1183
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,200
credentials work with your people on the

1184
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,480
infrastructure team that does the

1185
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,280
backups

1186
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,560
let them know that they could use a

1187
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,880
password utility and keep it separate

1188
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,680
um and not on the same domain too and

1189
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,359
that that's generally how a lot of that

1190
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,520
stuff will be fixed

1191
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
or if it's on a data center

1192
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,280
infrastructure that's maintained by

1193
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,880
something else like vmware

1194
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,560
and they're able to destroy the vms put

1195
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,160
that into your scope but as long as

1196
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,920
you're able to segment that off a

1197
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,000
as a certain part and then not have the

1198
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,440
same credentials that they might harvest

1199
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
during a ransomware attack

1200
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,560
that is your your proper way of doing

1201
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,240
the backups you don't have to have

1202
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,480
like tape backups you gotta go off site

1203
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,359
stuff like that

1204
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,960
you just have to have you think smart

1205
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,400
when you're doing the backups

1206
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,760
uh the other thing is uh system

1207
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,520
hardening that is a huge thing when it

1208
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,640
comes to

1209
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,440
um expensive windows products on

1210
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,320
lessening the

1211
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,119
attack surface that's one of the biggest

1212
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,560
ones that i've seen recently because

1213
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,359
we do red team engagements every year or

1214
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,800
adversary simulations

1215
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,839
and uh going from you know a few years

1216
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:26,400
ago to

1217
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,880
now with additional system hardening uh

1218
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,920
the the time

1219
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,520
for the attack lessens a lot it is a

1220
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,640
huge win

1221
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
and a lot of the stuff out there

1222
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,200
actually don't impact the organization

1223
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,760
and i'm sure one of my co-workers will

1224
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
do a talk on this eventually

1225
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,839
because we spend a lot of time on this

1226
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,000
but um it's really not that bad and i

1227
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,760
think more organizations need to spend

1228
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,079
time

1229
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,839
on it like your biggest wins are going

1230
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,839
to be like disabling broadcast

1231
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,119
um protocols like lmnr netbios

1232
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,400
wpad other things like that the other

1233
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,320
thing is uh like i mentioned cadences

1234
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,599
with your infrastructure team you want

1235
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,720
to make sure that

1236
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,040
you keep in sync with them on that um

1237
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,079
and then the other

1238
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,000
biggest win would be you you obviously

1239
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,520
want to have an instant response team

1240
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,200
and some some companies aren't that

1241
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,880
large and your answer response team is

1242
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,000
the infrastructure team

1243
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,680
but as long as they have playbooks

1244
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,599
involved in how to resolve that stuff

1245
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,200
that is a huge win and the other thing

1246
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
is um

1247
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,440
get your basics done first don't spend

1248
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
money on like the new fancy

1249
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,320
user behavior analytics or products when

1250
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,359
you don't have a sim

1251
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,960
when you don't have asset management um

1252
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,240
so you yeah

1253
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,960
and and it's funny because like asset

1254
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,400
management is always hard and every

1255
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,640
company gets it wrong if you spend more

1256
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,560
time on that and get make sure that

1257
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,599
they're in your

1258
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,160
um you know platform of patch management

1259
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,960
or

1260
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,520
platform of your security tools those

1261
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,119
are going to be your biggest wins

1262
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,320
and if you're going to be dumping all

1263
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,079
this money in user behavior analytics

1264
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,119
and you can't even get your asset

1265
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,480
management done

1266
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,880
how do you create a defined list when it

1267
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,839
comes to user behavior

1268
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,320
uh another thing i see been seeing this

1269
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
on twitter a lot lately and i want to

1270
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,079
just kind of publicly state this

1271
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,440
because i think this is something that

1272
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,920
the industry needs to kind of say

1273
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,480
victim shaming on companies and people

1274
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,160
no matter if their posture is good or

1275
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,200
bad

1276
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,359
is is not right you should not do that

1277
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,359
and the other thing is that

1278
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,880
a lot of people think ransomware is like

1279
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,520
oh just throw mfa you fix ransomware

1280
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,680
the groups are super sophisticated if

1281
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,440
they spend enough time targeting you

1282
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,920
they'll

1283
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,000
they're going to get you the that's the

1284
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,920
biggest problem with these things

1285
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,440
it's not as cut dry solution so um

1286
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,760
i just want to say that hands down i

1287
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
would hire a high school dropout who

1288
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,880
dealt with ransomware

1289
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
than a phd in cyber security who never

1290
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,160
dealt with an incident

1291
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
and that's something that kind of shows

1292
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,800
because i you know i run a cyber

1293
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,040
security program at a larger hospital

1294
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,599
that that shows that it doesn't matter

1295
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,920
what certification degree you get

1296
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,119
um when it comes to living the

1297
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,720
experience at that moment

1298
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,760
it is way more valuable and for people

1299
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
out there to publicly say that oh he was

1300
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,839
part of equifax during this incident

1301
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,359
you don't know what they were doing and

1302
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,720
you can't just put a blanket statement

1303
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,920
blaming them that oh

1304
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,880
they're going to be crappy because it

1305
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,200
comes from equifax you know so

1306
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
and i hands down if this guy was part of

1307
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
equifax dealing with uh

1308
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
incident at that time and discovered it

1309
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,480
i would hire him way more than anybody

1310
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,119
else in

1311
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,599
in the in the industry when it comes to

1312
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,560
finding resumes

1313
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,000
yeah so um the other thing is like i

1314
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,520
said ransomware operators are getting

1315
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,319
more and more

1316
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,480
sophisticated uh the only thing they

1317
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,839
haven't done yet which i'm going to be

1318
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,240
sad

1319
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
when i mention this and they end up

1320
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,040
doing it is living off the land

1321
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,880
techniques that a lot of the

1322
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,119
nation-state sponsors or your apt groups

1323
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,560
or whatever you want to call them

1324
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,760
uh do but um

1325
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,160
the like i said the initial uh

1326
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,440
compromise so like

1327
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,920
the initial email uh and a lot of times

1328
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,040
um

1329
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,440
the initial compromise are actually

1330
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,560
credential theft

1331
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,800
that look like bc and they actually have

1332
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,240
been linking a lot of these um

1333
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,000
you know credential theft sites to

1334
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,079
particular ransomware groups

1335
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,040
uh and then uh from there they will you

1336
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,760
know

1337
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,079
deploy it on their uh they'll get in the

1338
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,160
vpn and log into the network and deploy

1339
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,640
things

1340
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,319
but from the initial compromise to the

1341
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,839
go live where they're basically shutting

1342
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:24,880
down the whole network

1343
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,119
encrypting everything it got down to the

1344
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,359
point where it's less than five hours

1345
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,079
and uh if you talk to anybody in it to

1346
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,079
actually go into a company and discover

1347
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,200
all assets in five hours i mean good

1348
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,160
luck yet these

1349
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,000
ransomware groups got that down to a

1350
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,280
science so

1351
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,920
um i'm not saying anything but if a

1352
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
company from ukraine or russia

1353
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,720
builds an asset management uh software

1354
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,640
i'll probably invest in their stock

1355
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,160
but um it is something that the uh

1356
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,200
it's scary that how these you know

1357
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,839
adversaries do it better than large

1358
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,319
corporations

1359
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,760
so as i mentioned a lot of these

1360
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,680
ransomware groups this email compromise

1361
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,359
they're outside of interpol interpol is

1362
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,400
basically

1363
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,119
i hate to say ruled police in a way they

1364
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,400
they kind of um

1365
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,079
it's i think it's part of the united

1366
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,079
nations but they they basically

1367
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,119
create um to be part of the imf you

1368
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,319
kind of have some collaboration with

1369
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,480
that stuff and they're able to go into

1370
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,480
those countries and enforce law

1371
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,680
uh outside of um you know their standard

1372
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,599
federal law most of these uh

1373
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,520
solutions to fix ransomware are

1374
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,880
difficult i've seen a lot of things

1375
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,960
thrown out there such as

1376
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,200
you know block payments to these groups

1377
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,400
um you know

1378
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,200
put additional sanctions on these

1379
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,240
countries

1380
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,400
and it's also really hard to say block

1381
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,839
payments because then

1382
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,560
they may switch to uh from bitcoin to

1383
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,680
monroe

1384
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,640
or some some type of cryptocurrency that

1385
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,839
doesn't uh

1386
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,000
uh have the ability to track um so

1387
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,359
and i don't even know if the government

1388
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,200
can truly enforce blocking payments to

1389
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,480
these ransomware groups

1390
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,960
yet alone the other problem is that if

1391
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,640
you get ransomware and you can't pay to

1392
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,839
get your data back

1393
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,960
some of these companies will fold though

1394
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,880
my suggestion to fix a lot of this

1395
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,400
ransomware because

1396
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,720
if you deal ir you know that stuff is

1397
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,880
getting worse and worse every year

1398
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,680
give companies a cyber security stimulus

1399
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,000
check

1400
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,680
i mean obviously companies will have

1401
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,520
different like you'll be a you know

1402
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,160
a larger check for a company in the

1403
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,240
billions versus a company that's

1404
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,400
you know mom and pop shop but provide

1405
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,240
that to provide better cyber security

1406
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,040
tools

1407
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,520
and and if they get ransomware when they

1408
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,720
file their taxes

1409
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,640
and they pay for the ransom then they

1410
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,839
won't they will have to pay that

1411
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,520
stimulus check back

1412
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,040
that provides incentives because then it

1413
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,560
gives you the capability

1414
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,040
for these organizations to actually

1415
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,119
build that cyber security program

1416
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,520
organically versus post-mortem after

1417
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,240
ransomware

1418
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,440
and when they're doing post-mortem

1419
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,640
they're already lost and they need the

1420
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,079
data and they're paying for the fees

1421
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,760
but if you give the companies the

1422
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
opportunity to build it earlier

1423
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,160
then it's an easy win and hopefully that

1424
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,079
will kind of lessen that threshold other

1425
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,440
than that it's going to be like

1426
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,839
well maybe let some companies fold or go

1427
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,680
to water worth russia i don't know what

1428
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,200
what the solution to that problem would

1429
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,640
be but

1430
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,560
there's not really an easy solution and

1431
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,720
it's going to get worse and worse

1432
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,319
so let's talk about regulations so

1433
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,520
uh who here uh knows all these terms i

1434
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,200
got a lot of acronyms up there

1435
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,400
ot networks who's familiar with that any

1436
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,200
industrial people all right uh hipaa

1437
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,680
with two a's

1438
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
stressing the two a's because it's

1439
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,720
accountability act

1440
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,119
not you know i always always pronounce

1441
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,880
it to some people like hip hop

1442
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,560
because it's very common that they get

1443
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,880
that wrong but ephi is the thing

1444
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,079
cde who's familiar with the term cde

1445
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,520
so that's part of the payment processing

1446
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,119
industry so uh

1447
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,560
that's basically saying that you have a

1448
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,839
separate network where you do

1449
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,200
transaction processing

1450
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,720
and then socks separation of duty so

1451
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,280
all these are concepts that are created

1452
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,079
that help in certain aspects but

1453
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,599
obviously probably create more problems

1454
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,920
in the long run

1455
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,720
when you're when your compliance kind of

1456
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,520
puts things into a bucket

1457
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,359
you're gonna not look at it as a

1458
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,960
holistic view

1459
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,640
and you're end up gonna be just worried

1460
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,319
about your cd network only

1461
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,240
and that cd network is controlled by a

1462
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,480
vpn appliance that you don't patch

1463
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,560
and then that becomes an issue um

1464
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,640
i build my programs as a holistic view

1465
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,160
because you got to look at the whole

1466
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,880
thing

1467
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,319
i mean you could constantly do

1468
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,000
segmentation checks you could constantly

1469
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,119
do

1470
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,280
other aspects of it but ultimately

1471
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,319
there's going to be a

1472
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,000
end user that could be compromised to

1473
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,760
deal with that stuff you need to build

1474
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,520
the program as a very holistic view to

1475
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,520
help out with all those scenarios

1476
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,599
you can't just put that in that bucket

1477
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,560
and i think the

1478
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,160
industry as a whole has been doing a

1479
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,599
kind of a bad job of

1480
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,240
encouraging that behavior versus just

1481
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,880
look at

1482
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,680
what the attackers do and really just

1483
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,400
build the program around that

1484
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,240
but ultimately if you build your

1485
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
security program around like that

1486
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,040
like ot stuff or other things out there

1487
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,680
where it's

1488
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,000
strictly kind of more perimeter defense

1489
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,920
or just separate buckets

1490
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,480
i i'm a firm believer that the program

1491
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,400
will fail more likely

1492
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,440
because you're the the complexity of

1493
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,920
a lot of these networks the the the use

1494
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,200
of a lot of these tools that we're going

1495
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,880
to be using cloud-based services

1496
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,079
you're constantly poking holes in the

1497
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,119
firewall um and the the attacker methods

1498
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,560
of lateral movement is

1499
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,880
becoming more and more dominant so the

1500
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,800
concept of perimeter defenses and

1501
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,640
putting things in buckets just don't

1502
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,480
work doesn't work that well

1503
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,680
um so generally when you build the

1504
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,160
program

1505
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
you want to build security with security

1506
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,359
in mind

1507
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,960
if you build it with compliance in mind

1508
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,640
then you're not going to build a proper

1509
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,079
program

1510
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,160
if you build with security in mind

1511
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,079
you'll naturally just become compliant

1512
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:04,640
because

1513
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,800
if you do enough you know in that

1514
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,760
program

1515
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,359
you won't have to worry about like you

1516
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,440
know checking a box for is it hipaa or

1517
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,480
is it pci

1518
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
if you build it properly you're going to

1519
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,680
just automatically hit that

1520
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,599
checkbox and if not you're going to have

1521
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,200
most of those checks boxes filled

1522
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,800
and it's going to be easy to then add on

1523
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,640
to it

1524
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,960
and i mean you have all these companies

1525
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,119
out there like equifax's pci

1526
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,720
you know that's a name that they throw

1527
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,400
out there a lot um target

1528
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,480
stuff like that um they they follow the

1529
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,079
regulations they get their return of

1530
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,440
compliance and pci

1531
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,920
i actually am i'm more fond of due to

1532
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,040
the fact that they

1533
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,880
require like a qsa well pci level one

1534
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
where you're you do enough transaction

1535
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,599
processing they require a qsa

1536
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,400
uh to evaluate controls now it's a

1537
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:50,720
little

1538
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,319
subjective and biased because when you

1539
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,079
deal with qsas you might have one that

1540
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,160
has a network admin background or

1541
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,520
one that has a um a sim background

1542
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,880
and they tend to focus more on that

1543
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,280
stuff but at least they have a third

1544
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,040
party coming in there to help evaluate

1545
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,160
it versus

1546
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,319
uh you're not forced to by these other

1547
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,040
regulations to do that

1548
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,359
but ultimately all these places that are

1549
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,800
known with these regulations where they

1550
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,640
get that return of compliance every year

1551
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,240
they still get ransomware so it doesn't

1552
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,000
really matter and that's why you need to

1553
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,760
really kind of stop ignoring the

1554
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,440
regulations obviously you need to do it

1555
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,960
because that's required

1556
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,200
but you need to look at it more of an

1557
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,720
attacker's standpoint and how to build

1558
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,959
that

1559
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,640
and the other thing is uh

1560
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,040
misinterpretation of regulations

1561
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,960
um as i mentioned earlier the whole

1562
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,559
separation of duty whether it comes to

1563
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:39,119
engine

1564
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,839
engineers and analysts socks is stated

1565
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,760
for financially significant applications

1566
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,400
i get that

1567
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,920
i hear that a lot where people are like

1568
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,520
oh you need to separate the duty from

1569
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,800
the engineers and analysts because of

1570
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,000
separation duty

1571
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,559
is your sim a financially significant

1572
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,160
application

1573
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,400
the answer is no and if it is then

1574
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,200
there's some

1575
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,880
you really need to clean up your logs

1576
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,319
because that's really weird you're doing

1577
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,280
it that way

1578
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,559
so um you know i i think that

1579
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,000
you know putting those barriers and i

1580
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,599
think cobit kind of started a lot of

1581
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,000
that

1582
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,160
uh kind of framework around that putting

1583
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,520
those barriers are just going to create

1584
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,880
more and more problems

1585
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,839
when you're dealing with incident

1586
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,359
response anybody that's dealing with

1587
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,240
that stuff

1588
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,520
and you're on ground zero when it

1589
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,680
happens nobody cares about barriers

1590
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,520
everyone wants to get it done now

1591
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,599
so those walls just magically disappear

1592
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,040
why can't those walls disappear at an

1593
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,760
earlier time the way i look at it

1594
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,359
so when you're building a program

1595
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,480
you know planning phases show progress

1596
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,200
that helps with that duty of care that

1597
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,599
um

1598
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,559
you know growth patterns i'm i'm fond of

1599
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,160
metrics of engineering

1600
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,599
not metrics of like my id or ips

1601
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,440
dropped five million uh court scans

1602
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,760
cool it's been dropped why are we even

1603
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,720
looking at it

1604
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,240
that's the way i look at it i'm like i

1605
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,800
don't care about all these bs metrics

1606
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,640
but i do care about the engineering

1607
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,480
metrics are you able to deploy more

1608
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,280
system hardware

1609
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,960
are you able to get patching to a

1610
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,480
certain level are you

1611
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,200
able to engineer your email gateway to

1612
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,640
block more stuff

1613
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,400
those really matter because that's the

1614
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,240
realistic side are you able to

1615
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,839
incorporate another tool to um you know

1616
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,440
encourage some type of better behavior

1617
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,119
are you able to multi-factor across the

1618
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:19,920
enterprise

1619
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,800
those matter the other thing is and i

1620
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,160
you know i haven't seen a whole lot of

1621
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,599
people do that and

1622
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,520
shout out to some of the sponsors here

1623
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,440
they do the stuff all the time both the

1624
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,160
advisory

1625
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,720
uh you know my advice is the best in the

1626
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,240
world there's people out there that do

1627
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,359
this for a living

1628
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,200
but on top of that there's companies out

1629
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,400
there that'll do event

1630
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,640
adversary simulations and that's one of

1631
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,440
the things that i

1632
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,760
really love to show those metrics of

1633
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,559
showing

1634
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,800
when somebody comes in for the first pen

1635
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
test to down the road after you do

1636
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,839
system hardening

1637
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,319
patching vulnerability scanning that

1638
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,200
that

1639
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,440
path of were they able to compromise

1640
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,400
early on

1641
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,480
versus were we able to stop them later

1642
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,880
on that metrics through simulation is

1643
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,160
not really common

1644
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,599
that i've seen a lot of the other

1645
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,280
security officers out in the industry

1646
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,359
but it is a very valuable thing because

1647
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,040
that's the closest you can get to

1648
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,960
showing that are we ready to be dealing

1649
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,559
with ransomware

1650
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,880
um and like i said it's based around

1651
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,960
those type of current attack methods

1652
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,319
whether it be dealing with ransomware

1653
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,480
bus email compromise these adversary

1654
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,680
simulations will do that exact thing

1655
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,839
uh the other thing uh it's been a little

1656
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,200
bit of a pet peeve

1657
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,800
of mine um and uh not to say anything

1658
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,480
wrong with miter meyer is an amazing

1659
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,119
framework

1660
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,920
it goes very in depth on the actual

1661
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,760
landscape of all the different types of

1662
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,720
things out there

1663
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,839
it's like uh it i hate it's kind of used

1664
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:42,800
as a buzzword now

1665
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,720
it's like the whole um lockheed martin

1666
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,559
cyberkill chain type of thing where now

1667
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,800
mitre is a new kind of terminology

1668
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,280
it's great but when you're a company

1669
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,720
less than a billion in revenue

1670
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,400
and you're going through a spreadsheet

1671
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,800
of a hundred rows and columns to talk

1672
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,520
about

1673
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,240
are we protecting against uh passive

1674
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,520
reconnaissance which

1675
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,359
you can't there's no such thing and

1676
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,800
protect against that

1677
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,440
but when you build your program out i

1678
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,280
mean start smaller think about the

1679
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,000
kind of what the attackers do and uh

1680
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,119
i'll actually

1681
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,720
open up the questions after this but i

1682
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,559
want people to argue with this

1683
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,480
right here let me know if there's

1684
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,000
anything on here

1685
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,319
that is not how you would resolve

1686
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,920
something through its response

1687
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,760
you have exploit which is basically

1688
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,359
getting shell on a box or

1689
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,760
you know what not and then post exploit

1690
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,599
which will be internal reconnaissance

1691
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,559
which is basically also lateral movement

1692
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,480
escalation persistence and then

1693
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,920
obviously your end goal which will be

1694
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,040
either x fill or

1695
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,160
operational impact i know miter is very

1696
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,920
large and has like a lot of subgroups in

1697
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,880
there for that

1698
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,480
but um let me know if there's anything

1699
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,160
that you could think that's outside of

1700
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,720
these

1701
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,960
this picture when it comes to how you

1702
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,839
would resolve it

1703
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,680
and it's a response i mean granted

1704
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,880
there's like like i said

1705
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,319
passive reconnaissance i'm not going to

1706
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,000
see who's googling me

1707
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,640
i don't have that data but i will know

1708
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,119
somebody

1709
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,000
exploits and now port scanning may be

1710
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,760
needed but it's it's kind of

1711
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,760
a nuisance i mean everyone does it and

1712
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,200
there's so many different companies that

1713
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,640
just scan all the time

1714
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,559
this is what really how your incident

1715
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,200
response team should look at it

1716
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,240
and then the last um i i didn't have

1717
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,760
enough time for this conference

1718
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,559
um this was a little bit of a pop-up but

1719
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:22,880
uh

1720
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,920
i will be putting together a concept

1721
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,960
it's called get gooder um it's

1722
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,760
just more of my

1723
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,760
distaste to a lot of the compliance that

1724
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,440
are out there because they're they build

1725
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,920
it with uh usually people that are

1726
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,359
maybe politically motivated or i swear

1727
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:43,680
like pci console has a thing about

1728
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,079
tls for some reason like i can't

1729
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,440
remember the last time a data breach

1730
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,760
happened because somebody used tls 1.0

1731
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,280
yet they don't really care about sql

1732
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,040
injection as much i mean obviously they

1733
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,599
do

1734
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,839
web app scans part of it but like that's

1735
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,920
where most of the stuff happens so i got

1736
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,480
a feeling

1737
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,000
somebody like one of these load balancer

1738
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,599
companies wants to

1739
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,800
upsell that but um all these compliance

1740
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,720
frameworks that are out there

1741
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,640
they don't really wrap around what a

1742
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,480
sophisticated attacker will do

1743
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,240
so i'll eventually this just came from

1744
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,839
like a whiteboarding session as me and

1745
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,200
my co-workers were talking about

1746
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,040
i want to build a framework with like

1747
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,800
what people look at corporate security

1748
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,599
like you know

1749
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,040
employment litigation sometimes

1750
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,040
e-discovery when it comes to that stuff

1751
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,720
you know using security team for that

1752
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,640
but uh you know the corporate security

1753
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,400
side whether regular

1754
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,440
regulations or uh your legal team uh

1755
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,880
reaching out to you about that

1756
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,000
and then the right side is the um the

1757
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,160
malware groups you know your

1758
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
business email compromise groups uh

1759
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,319
state sponsors ransomware groups and the

1760
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,440
types of methods that you

1761
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,280
have and in the middle is your corporate

1762
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,720
environment you'll have like your

1763
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,680
laptops

1764
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,920
well as dns logs will protect you

1765
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,880
against

1766
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,200
uh you know ransomware groups will help

1767
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,359
kind of detect against ransomware groups

1768
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,880
and i want to break that on more of an

1769
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,640
open source holistic view it's going to

1770
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,160
be kind of like either a mind map or

1771
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,160
just a really ugly spreadsheet

1772
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,920
um which is probably like another miter

1773
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,599
version and hopefully somebody makes fun

1774
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,920
of me for being a little verbose on it

1775
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,599
but either way i want to create a

1776
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,359
platform that kind of creates a baseline

1777
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,760
of

1778
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,359
the realistic side of these attacker

1779
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,960
groups and

1780
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,960
the individual like items and how

1781
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,640
effective they are whether like

1782
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,799
understanding parent child process uh

1783
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,480
with like edr or suspense

1784
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,680
like that um so i'm gonna go ahead and

1785
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,799
um

1786
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,280
running into i think close to an hour uh

1787
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,079
open up uh

1788
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,920
questions uh feel free to hit me up on

1789
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,440
twitter um

1790
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,160
you know my handle is alex underscore s

1791
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,920
underscore cod

1792
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,559
but uh go ahead open up questions or if

1793
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:41,599
somebody wants to

1794
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,440
yell at me saying that no there's more

1795
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,799
stuff to that than uh

1796
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,319
for answer response open the floor for

1797
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:49,680
that

1798
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,760
lady and the fraud who is a great

1799
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,839
inspiration to the infosec community

1800
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,760
and i'm glad to meet her in person one

1801
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,920
day

1802
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,400
oh yeah yeah yeah probably should have

1803
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,760
thought that through well

1804
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,920
so i i tried doing the sticky tape

1805
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,440
because it worked and then uh after

1806
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,799
writing it fell down

1807
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,720
and then life got busy so i'm like

1808
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,400
whatever i'm just gonna take a photo of

1809
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,480
it for now

1810
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,839
yeah the yeah

1811
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,760
i'm going to not have that up anymore

1812
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,000
thank you

1813
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,440
person for something

1814
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,839
yeah yes nope it is uh gathering

1815
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,599
information to guarantee the

1816
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,119
under development of risk yeah yeah i

1817
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,160
wanted a kind of a

1818
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,200
catchy phrase yeah

1819
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,920
yeah it could be a government program oh

1820
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,400
god

1821
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,599
please no no

1822
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,359
my goal is to build out like a platform

1823
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,280
around that that

1824
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,119
security vendors could use that as an

1825
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,559
effective rate because there's

1826
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,799
mitre is great but it's geared towards

1827
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,079
apd groups

1828
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,000
it's not a more of a holistic view of

1829
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,559
effectiveness on tools

1830
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,079
oh oh god

1831
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,839
yeah no but and and um

1832
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,200
rocky over there is disagreeing with me

1833
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,440
which he's correct he uses miter a lot

1834
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,960
more than i do

1835
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,440
um i i'm just more looking at it as

1836
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,760
the nitty-gritty of if i'm going to be

1837
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,280
getting an edr tool

1838
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,960
what does it all do and the

1839
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,640
effectiveness around it

1840
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,480
and yeah you could match that with miter

1841
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,000
some of them do that it gets a little

1842
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,920
convoluted i wanted something kind of

1843
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,839
very agnostic and open

1844
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,839
uh when it comes to that but uh rocky

1845
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,359
we'll we'll talk after this

1846
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,440
i know you'll drill me on that stuff and

1847
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,760
and again nothing to do wrong with mitre

1848
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,680
i just think that when you're trying to

1849
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,520
build a program out especially

1850
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,960
organizations less than a billion in

1851
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,359
revenue it gets really complex

1852
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:46,880
and i'm the type of person that loves it

1853
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,119
verbose i mean when i talk sometimes

1854
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,160
some people say instead of tech vvv

1855
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,000
just do tech v because that's too much

1856
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,280
information

1857
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,400
but um i i think mitre is kind of a

1858
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,240
too much of a hurdle initially unless

1859
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,000
you have i guess some organizations help

1860
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
you out with that so

1861
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,760
i wouldn't know who would do that though

1862
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,839
but um

1863
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,880
yeah but there are like you said there

1864
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,640
are companies that do help out with that

1865
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,400
shout out to rocky over there

1866
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,839
so uh partially

1867
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,839
partially we have our uh agreement and

1868
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,839
disagreements but i think we come across

1869
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,160
the same exact concept that it's very

1870
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,040
hard to get

1871
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,960
as an entry level and that's where i'm

1872
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,160
going with this is that

1873
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,920
start with smaller go bigger if you need

1874
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,839
to

1875
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:39,440
other questions so does that mean

1876
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,119
for the people that understand mitre

1877
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,480
better you're going to map this to miner

1878
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,400
the question was do you think spider

1879
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,319
better should map this so make it more

1880
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,520
convoluted

1881
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,559
maybe i don't know this was literally a

1882
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,359
random idea

1883
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,280
i thought about before covet life got

1884
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,799
busy but i definitely want to circle

1885
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:57,760
back

1886
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,799
i i'm full of openness when it comes to

1887
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:01,839
critiquing it

1888
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,599
i may build it and people will be like

1889
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,359
this crappy and then get rid of it

1890
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,440
but i think that the biggest problem is

1891
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,760
that when you're an engineer trying to

1892
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,440
build a program and look at all the

1893
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,880
different tools out there

1894
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,799
it's not really cut and dry like well

1895
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,319
this protected me gets ransomware will

1896
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,760
this protect me against this email

1897
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,480
compromise

1898
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,680
and that's the reason why i was thinking

1899
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,440
about building this platform will this

1900
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,079
help me with

1901
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,079
host-based forensics will this help with

1902
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,119
uh uh

1903
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,520
employment litigation or insider threats

1904
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,040
there's no platform out there that

1905
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,400
really kind of looks at that as a

1906
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,760
holistic view and that's why i was

1907
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,799
going to build that cis controls

1908
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,160
to this as like uh cis

1909
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,200
like you know uh kind of he's

1910
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:47,839
saying if it's cis to mitre uh

1911
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,160
but it's more of it maps towards the

1912
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:56,960
person that

1913
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,920
has the budget and buying the tools

1914
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,040
there's nothing out there that i see

1915
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,480
that does that and that's why i want to

1916
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,040
build it

1917
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,880
but i want to keep it agnostic and open

1918
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,240
because like you could say

1919
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,559
edr product well i don't like that i

1920
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,280
rather say

1921
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,839
you know parent child process validation

1922
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:12,880
and prevention

1923
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,119
uh you know does it have the option to

1924
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,799
look at command line parameters

1925
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,359
things like that and how effective it is

1926
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,559
when it comes to

1927
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,480
writing ransomware things like that i

1928
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,839
want to kind of map that

1929
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,839
in the sense of if i'm going to be

1930
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,280
buying these tools is there something

1931
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,720
out there that i could kind of leverage

1932
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,000
and also help improve the uh people

1933
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,839
making these tools because now

1934
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,760
they're not just creating a vague

1935
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,599
concept of you know

1936
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,839
this protects against this it's it's a

1937
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:40,960
better metric to

1938
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,920
kind of geared around that

1939
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,720
all right any other questions

1940
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,720
oh gosh yes will it be a compliance

1941
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,599
framework

1942
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,480
i will have it as a well mitre attack

1943
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,440
isn't compliance

1944
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,880
so it'll be kind of similar to that

1945
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,559
it'll be like a model

1946
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,280
that you can leverage i i will obviously

1947
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,119
if it's an open source project

1948
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,119
i'll let the community kind of yell at

1949
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,880
me and help contribute

1950
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,319
but i'm never going to make it something

1951
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:11,839
where somebody's going to be like oh you

1952
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,440
need to do it this way

1953
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,920
it'll be kind of a loose guideline that

1954
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,880
hopefully will work

1955
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,799
and if it does work then you know you'll

1956
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,400
base it off of it but it's not going to

1957
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:20,720
be

1958
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,799
something that i hope companies say that

1959
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,160
you need to follow this it'll be kind of

1960
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,599
annoying if it was

1961
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,359
i'm i anti against that

1962
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,319
any other questions

1963
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,480
all right cool well i guess then i'll uh

1964
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,640
segue to the the second part

1965
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,000
talk about network forensics um my other

1966
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,319
talk

1967
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:53,839
so yep

1968
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:05,680
i'll make this one quicker because my

1969
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,200
voice is dying

1970
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,680
i generally don't talk that long um in a

1971
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,400
row

1972
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,200
so um i want to do a quick kick off of

1973
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,559
network forensics

1974
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:15,920
some of this stuff is going to be pretty

1975
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,680
elementary like some one-on-one stuff

1976
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,000
that

1977
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,480
if you've done this stuff before it may

1978
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,760
bore you a little bit

1979
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,839
but most importantly though before

1980
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,200
everyone kind of gets distracted to

1981
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,000
leave

1982
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,920
downstairs we are hosting a network

1983
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,160
forensic village we're doing a ctf style

1984
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:30,960
this year

1985
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,799
so there will be questions on there like

1986
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,640
101 questions 201

1987
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,599
like what is the uh utility like a 101

1988
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:38,000
question

1989
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,200
is what is the uh utility for

1990
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,720
uh windows to test icmp uh

1991
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,000
traffic go ahead

1992
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,359
we'll give this answer to everyone it'll

1993
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,119
be a freebie

1994
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,960
come on yeah i think i think he's trying

1995
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,200
to speak it up

1996
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,480
good say it yep exactly ping so that's a

1997
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,680
free one for everyone

1998
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,680
so uh there'll be a list of questions

1999
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,280
and we'll be opening up shortly the uh

2000
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,559
the lab environment

2001
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,079
which is going to be a black box the

2002
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,319
molec box also has siri kata

2003
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,520
we um that that box digested the ids

2004
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,400
alerts

2005
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,079
so you actually see it in the actual

2006
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,079
molec web interface you're more welcome

2007
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,680
to download the full packet capture

2008
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,200
and use anything that i talk about on

2009
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,280
this talk but feel free

2010
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,160
i got some my crew down there uh uh you

2011
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:24,640
know

2012
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,720
able to help out with that and they'll

2013
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,839
be able to get you signed up

2014
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,400
on the ctf and rocky will be handing out

2015
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,839
gift cards for uh

2016
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,599
first and second place so there will be

2017
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,680
prizes associated to uh whoever wins

2018
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:44,240
so first on the network forensic side um

2019
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,520
the biggest problem when it comes to

2020
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,200
understanding networking

2021
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,000
is uh there's there's um i'll just kind

2022
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,720
of skip ahead

2023
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,359
there's two different models um out

2024
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:56,559
there there's a tcp

2025
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,680
ip model and the osi model a lot of

2026
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,920
a lot of people teach the osi model and

2027
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,440
i i think it's a great thing but when it

2028
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,880
comes to like wireshark

2029
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,319
and how the packet's encapsulated um

2030
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,039
in general it is a little more

2031
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,720
convoluted when it comes to the

2032
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,079
like what's this between session

2033
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,839
presentation application

2034
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,000
so this talk is going to be more towards

2035
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,839
the dod model

2036
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,000
um but essentially when you're sending a

2037
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,359
piece of uh traffic

2038
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,200
like an arp or uh request

2039
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,920
it's going to have the kind of layers of

2040
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,000
protocols that it evaluates

2041
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,760
before it gets to the router so it

2042
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,359
starts with your mac address and an arp

2043
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:36,160
request

2044
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,839
and then that mac address is your

2045
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,520
default gateway so your

2046
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,440
your your configured device will have a

2047
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,440
default gateway

2048
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,839
and inside of that default gateway will

2049
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,359
have the ability to

2050
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,720
you know take apart the packet saying

2051
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,720
that this is my destination

2052
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,039
and then it will say okay here's the

2053
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,319
actual gateway

2054
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:56,799
with that mac address go talk to them

2055
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,400
and then from there they'll take that

2056
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,599
traffic and hop between

2057
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,000
next router and next router to to when

2058
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,200
you get to the destination

2059
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:10,960
so um the the packet information

2060
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,319
uh has uh like i said the mac address

2061
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,799
it has the source of destination and

2062
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,319
then they'll also have uh

2063
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,000
kind of some parameter options whether

2064
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,400
it be uh in the tcp side

2065
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,119
like if it's been acknowledged or if on

2066
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:25,760
the udp

2067
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,400
side there's no session handling it's

2068
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:28,880
just

2069
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,480
a shotgun approach but essentially

2070
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,880
when you send a piece of information

2071
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,079
it's going to have all the different

2072
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,760
parts of the protocol the ip header

2073
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,640
information

2074
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,599
the the the port information whether it

2075
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:42,000
be

2076
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,319
you know like tcp where it's a stateful

2077
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,160
protocol and if it was accepted or

2078
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,039
dropped

2079
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,839
or other parameters and then inside that

2080
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,760
part at the very bottom you have tcp

2081
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,960
data

2082
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,160
which basically goes into the protocol

2083
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,720
level

2084
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,319
and that's very important when it comes

2085
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,319
to network forensics

2086
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,559
and i'll talk about that in a second but

2087
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,720
all those protocols are usually

2088
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,359
designed by an organization uh usually

2089
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,880
the internet task force

2090
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,760
itf and they it's called rfc they have a

2091
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,559
request for

2092
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,799
uh comment where they have the ability

2093
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,480
to create that protocol standard

2094
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,319
so if you're sending email you're not

2095
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,559
sending your own version of smtp

2096
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,960
you're sending a part of that protocol

2097
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,480
that everyone agrees on

2098
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,000
and that's how pretty much the internet

2099
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,319
works but

2100
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,039
usually these protocols were designed in

2101
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,000
the 60s

2102
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,720
before the internet like ftp telenet

2103
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,079
things like that

2104
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,119
not 60s and late you know late

2105
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,160
you know early on in the 70s and whatnot

2106
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,119
um but they were they weren't built

2107
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,880
around the concept of

2108
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,240
you know large-scale internets attackers

2109
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,640
red team with blue team uh most of those

2110
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,240
protocols are kind of added on

2111
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,880
afterwards or they're they're designed

2112
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,000
differently to have

2113
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,599
uh kind of some components to help out

2114
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,760
with that where i'm getting with that is

2115
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,559
that

2116
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,720
um some of these protocols will have

2117
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,200
what is called information disclosure

2118
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,000
and uh in my previous talk about

2119
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,920
basically the um

2120
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,720
uh system hardening when you're getting

2121
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,119
rid of

2122
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,559
lmr net bios inside of those protocols

2123
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,319
you have the ability for like hostname

2124
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,359
information

2125
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,119
so in the lab downstairs there'll be

2126
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,400
some protocols out there

2127
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,400
like kerberos for example you could

2128
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,640
actually look in the actual kerbos

2129
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,520
data packet and see the user that was

2130
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,359
associated to that ip address

2131
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,760
because at one point he got a kerbos

2132
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,720
ticket

2133
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,160
and that will help kind of build that

2134
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,160
picture so if you're dealing with like

2135
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,319
post-mortem instant response and all you

2136
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,480
have is packet captures

2137
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,400
even though that the host level

2138
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,079
information is not there you could still

2139
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:48,960
tell

2140
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,000
who the person was and what ip address

2141
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,799
he had

2142
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,640
and then also you could break apart some

2143
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,240
of the protocols whether it be like an

2144
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,720
hp request we pull the file out and see

2145
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,319
what type of file it was where the

2146
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,038
attacker was

2147
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,000
so

2148
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,799
i'm actually not going to go over this a

2149
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,960
little bit too much but uh

2150
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,720
what i could do is to make it kind of a

2151
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,799
little bit more easier if anybody wants

2152
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,279
uh downstairs be part partake in the

2153
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,799
network forensic village

2154
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:20,719
i can actually go ahead and show these

2155
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:21,920
slides but

2156
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,679
in these slides i do go over like the

2157
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,600
concept of wireshark if you're familiar

2158
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,719
if you're not familiar with it i don't

2159
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,080
want to bore too many people

2160
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,399
but uh the the ability to actually go in

2161
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:31,679
there export

2162
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,799
filter off the wireshark so um

2163
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,759
i have the ability to follow a tcp

2164
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,158
stream

2165
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,479
so in tcp it's session so you're able to

2166
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,759
follow that whole packet all the way

2167
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,040
through

2168
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,960
and then uh in there i also have the

2169
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,719
ability to export objects

2170
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,960
uh the files so you can do analyzing of

2171
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,960
it network miner is another tool and so

2172
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,399
i kind of like the way i explain it's

2173
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:53,359
cheat mode

2174
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,719
where you can just kind of open it up

2175
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,479
and have a bigger picture it's a little

2176
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:57,520
bit easier

2177
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,920
um wireshark is going to obviously get

2178
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,880
you a lot more

2179
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,520
on the the low level and the full big

2180
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,080
picture

2181
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,439
but if you just want a quick answer

2182
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:06,799
sometimes throw up through network miner

2183
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,319
we'll get that quicker than anything

2184
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,319
else

2185
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,238
um and then in there i also talked about

2186
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:14,399
how pulling files off a network miner

2187
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,319
uh additionally uh you can use linux

2188
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,439
utilities out there

2189
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,279
uh there's other like windows utilities

2190
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,960
too

2191
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,279
to basically pull the information uh

2192
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:24,319
every file

2193
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,799
on the network will have a header and

2194
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,640
that header sometimes are like

2195
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,960
your extension could be pmg but the

2196
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,238
actual header will be like

2197
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:33,920
hello mz in there and they'll actually

2198
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,279
be an executable

2199
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,198
so sometimes attacker groups will do

2200
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,600
that where they do obfuscation by

2201
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,719
hiding in plain sight

2202
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,040
so if you want uh downstairs

2203
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,520
the ctf and i'll have this up on the

2204
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,319
screen down there

2205
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,080
uh there's uh the the wireless password

2206
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,719
for it uh the ctf server

2207
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:59,520
uh there's about 20 questions about 25

2208
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,159
ish

2209
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,640
uh and then uh like i said first prizes

2210
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,239
will uh and first and second prize will

2211
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,280
get gift cards

2212
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,800
um it is actual malware uh that we

2213
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,239
generated off of it

2214
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,159
uh so if you're do running this and

2215
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:13,920
you're not comfortable let us know

2216
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,880
um and uh but i ideally run that in a

2217
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,480
sandbox if you have like a windows box

2218
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,040
you can run

2219
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,320
uh hyper-v sandbox natively on it

2220
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,480
um or if you want just run it in a tool

2221
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,600
to analyze it

2222
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,199
um but uh i'll have this slide up

2223
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:28,800
downstairs if you guys want to reference

2224
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,760
that

2225
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,760
but uh feel free to ask any questions

2226
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,280
down there we want to people to

2227
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,040
participate

2228
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,040
some people might be foreign to uh it's

2229
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,159
called molec

2230
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,880
i think the new names are coming but uh

2231
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,159
you know we'll help you walk you through

2232
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:42,480
that

2233
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,560
and kind of get the experience on that

2234
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,560
that's one of the things that i

2235
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,640
want to stress is that there's a lot of

2236
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,679
cts out there

2237
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,440
at conferences that are more geared

2238
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,360
towards the red team but there's not a

2239
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:53,840
whole lot

2240
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,239
out there that are blue team focus and i

2241
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:57,199
think that's a

2242
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,600
very high need when it comes to the

2243
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,560
industry

2244
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,320
you're generally going to have like one

2245
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,000
red team and

2246
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,600
seven blue teams and maybe some

2247
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,600
compliance people in that security

2248
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,400
program

2249
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,000
the blue team is always needed you're

2250
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,600
gonna have a lot more

2251
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,800
and especially if you're doing instant

2252
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,040
response i don't think we could

2253
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,800
pull enough people out there to help

2254
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,080
fulfill the

2255
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,440
overwhelming growing of ransomware so i

2256
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,199
you know i'll do the i'm doing this

2257
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,120
event here for the network forensic

2258
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,560
down the road i'm hoping to do more of

2259
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,120
an elaborated blue team including sysmon

2260
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,320
um using elk to look at logs

2261
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,320
and actually simulate a full attack in

2262
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,400
there and kind of do a ctf style answer

2263
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,360
those questions

2264
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,679
but again downstairs feel free to hit me

2265
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,199
up and uh

2266
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:44,159
we'll definitely help you out through

2267
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,840
that

2268
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,199
you
