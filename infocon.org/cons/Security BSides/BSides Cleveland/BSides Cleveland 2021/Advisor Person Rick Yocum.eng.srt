1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,399
i have not

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,440
the degrees of separation are not there

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,400
all right

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,719
so so i have

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,840
two kind of pre-alpha topics i could go

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,960
through

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,119
uh they're both gonna be bad so fair

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,880
warning gonna be a terrible closer but

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,080
then you're all gonna wanna after party

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,039
so it's perfect

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,800
um so show of hands who wants me to talk

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,439
about like

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,279
behavioral economics topics and how

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,719
communication is important because we're

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,680
tech people when we suck at

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,120
communication

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
that's one that's one i see i see some i

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,800
see some

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,920
the other option is uh it's probably

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,399
shorter so maybe that's a benefit um

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
it's like the best lessons that i've

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,000
learned myself

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760
and that i uh and that people that have

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,680
worked for me have learned from me which

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,879
is kind of cool because i texted them

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,840
all in a panic

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
this morning when rocky was like oh you

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,000
might have to talk so

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,680
uh so i could go through that one too

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,960
and i want to make sure i reached out to

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,520
people that

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,640
uh i worked with in the past because i

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,280
might think

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
that stuff is cool but it's actually

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,400
stuff that benefited them

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
so if there's like more juniors i'll

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,280
talk about that if there's more seniors

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,760
i can talk about b or economics

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,080
both that is not in the card you didn't

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,960
pick my name twice

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
what do you want what do you want what

42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,919
do you want

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,759
oh god i hate all of you all right

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,600
we'll do uh we'll see we'll see if one

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
of them sucks interrupt me and like

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,720
whatever both in a suck if one of them

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,320
sucks really bad interrupt me and i'll

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,439
flip to the other real quick

49
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,720
let's start with lessons because it's

50
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,039
shorter

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
all right all right i'm counting on you

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,159
to do that again as soon as i start the

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,960
other one then i'm done

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
all right lessons i've i've stolen and

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
i've given all right so

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,280
first one in big one uh probably more

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
for some of the juniors um

58
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,719
be first and make waves right so

59
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,200
here's the deal if uh if if you're not

60
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
i started my career uh at deloitte and i

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,040
was

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,679
super intimidated out of the gate by

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,280
like the quality of the brains in the

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,319
room oftentimes

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,680
i thought there was tons of super smart

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,879
people it's like you're kind of trained

67
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,000
to do that oh it's a

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
great internship in college whatever and

69
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
it was it was i'm not

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,599
i'm not trying to disparage anyone here

71
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,800
but

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
it was intimidating right and you come

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,760
out and there's people that have been in

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,520
the industry forever

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
uh and you know what you end up finding

76
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
is uh i'd have a thought in a meeting

77
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
i'd be like oh why don't we just do this

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,480
but i didn't say it and then i get

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
really pissed off 10 minutes later when

80
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,200
someone else said it

81
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,239
and i see tons of people nodding and so

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,680
if there's anyone here who hasn't

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
learned that lesson

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
say the stupid thing first

85
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,440
also make a ton of jokes

86
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,000
make a ton of jokes and here's why so i

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
i remember having this uh

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
two reasons one it's just like good

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
personal stuff and

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,959
like what we do is way more people than

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,560
technology i do not you will not

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
convince me otherwise but you are

93
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
welcome to try

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
uh it's way more people in technology

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,760
but make jokes it's good from a people

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
perspective but also like sometimes you

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,360
make a joke

98
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
and i remember one of the best managers

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,200
i've ever had we're sitting in a room

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
again the late days and uh and i make a

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
dumb joke

102
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,120
and uh and everyone's like um

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
that's how people laugh at my jokes

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,319
mostly it's very polite and i appreciate

105
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:34,879
it

106
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,319
uh but but uh

107
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,400
like so people laugh and then someone

108
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,599
like starts another half sentence and

109
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
the senior major goes wait

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,560
say that again and i say the thing again

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,760
and then no one laughs because no one

112
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,319
knows what the hell is going on

113
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,519
and he goes well wait no no like we

114
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,480
we could actually do that thing and the

115
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,519
point with that is

116
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,879
like typically good jokes have a colonel

117
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
i'm not suggesting it was a good joke

118
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,920
but typically good jokes do have a

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
kernel of truth to them

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
and if you're telling jokes all the time

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,599
you're thinking differently you're

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,799
interacting

123
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,599
um oh man now i'm gonna get real

124
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,000
confused

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
gonna start to veer into my other talk

126
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,199
um

127
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,600
but like people are a lot more effective

128
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
when when you're playing

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
when you're having a good time when

130
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,479
you're interacting right and there's

131
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
a ton of stuff and it loops into stuff

132
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
we heard before about improv

133
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
in a million ways right getting out of

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
your comfort zone enjoying yourself

135
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,880
that's why

136
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,960
ir works really well when it's gamified

137
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,240
like jeremy was talking about like all

138
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,600
this stuff right

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,440
so the point is make jokes

140
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,479
play have fun and this job you guys all

141
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:44,880
know

142
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,120
gals will drive you absolutely bonkers

143
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,479
if you don't

144
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,120
so do your best to have fun but be first

145
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,479
say the thing

146
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,320
think a little bit differently and then

147
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
don't be afraid to joke around because

148
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,520
it's going to come up with uh

149
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
with cool ideas this is where i look at

150
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,320
my notes so hang out with me for a

151
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
second

152
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,199
rocky sing a song while i'm looking at

153
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,440
notes

154
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,440
that was a b flat from rocky uh thank

155
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,560
you thank you rocky

156
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,240
uh so um so i guess it's kind of a

157
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
semi-related lesson i don't have a story

158
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,240
for it

159
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
um but uh is first just like being

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,560
as far as being first goes he who's the

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
most prepared wins

162
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
right so i use this all the time i don't

163
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,840
really have a single story because it's

164
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
crazy important if you haven't done this

165
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
yet i highly advi

166
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,320
suggest it if there's like a plan on the

167
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
horizon like you know a decision needs

168
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
to get made whatever it is

169
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
and you're like someone who might have

170
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,280
some influence and there are other

171
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
people that might have some influence

172
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,759
maybe you have no influence right but

173
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,800
you know decision is going to get made

174
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
in a meeting

175
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840
build the plan and guess what will

176
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,639
happen

177
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,080
when you advertise that plan in the

178
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
meeting they're gonna do your thing

179
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,680
because there's gonna be one plan and

180
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
everyone else is like well i came to the

181
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
meeting to talk about the plan well now

182
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
they're talking about your plan and you

183
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,639
get it your way

184
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,440
i cannot recommend enough pre-planned

185
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,840
stuff

186
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,960
and then it'll get done your way um

187
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
so yeah probably 30 stories but i'm not

188
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,479
going to tell any of them but

189
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,479
pre-plan and you'll get your way because

190
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
i'm a brat and i like getting my way

191
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,880
um solving

192
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,160
problem-solving strategies again this

193
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
gets like being personal with with stuff

194
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
but um

195
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,319
or being personable with people um

196
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,919
worst experience in my in my career and

197
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,800
i've been doing

198
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
it stuff for like 21 years and securing

199
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,560
compliance for like 17 years

200
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,319
absolute worst experience i don't know

201
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,919
if any and i will name names with this

202
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,039
because this pissed me off

203
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,960
um anyone have experience with a product

204
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,600
called sand tap

205
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,080
yeah none of you it's trash it's not a

206
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,319
thing anymore

207
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,759
it caused i'm glad it was havoc um

208
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,240
so we were doing a data center migration

209
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,800
san

210
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,120
tap and basically it's hey you're

211
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,960
dumping a lot of data to

212
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
to a sand and uh yeah

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
let's you're moving data center so let's

214
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,840
just kind of fork the data

215
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
and it'll go yeah sounds like a bad idea

216
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
because it is and that's why no one

217
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,599
knows about it

218
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,720
um long story

219
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,960
medium long what ends up happening is

220
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
we end up with a one week long

221
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,240
rolling storage outage in our data

222
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
center

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,840
and no one can solve it no one can solve

224
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,400
it

225
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,840
it was stupid and bad and

226
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,960
uh but the cio at the time we have this

227
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,280
big-ass war room and he pulls everyone

228
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,240
in the war room like

229
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,599
40 people in there and he goes hey um

230
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,400
so i know everyone's really upset and

231
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
like on date on day two or three

232
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,479
it was like people are gonna get fired

233
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
if you don't fix this

234
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,960
day four the tune changed right like

235
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,840
he's like okay

236
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
i really just need help

237
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,759
but a really cool thing happened a

238
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,080
really really cool thing happened

239
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,599
and it kind of happened organically but

240
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,280
i'm never gonna forget it

241
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,599
um we had exhausted like every kind of

242
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,000
root

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,879
cause triage framework for figuring out

244
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,160
what the hell is going on

245
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,080
and then at one point uh one of the

246
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,639
managers goes

247
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,080
i i don't know i'll put five dollars

248
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
on it being this thing and he writes it

249
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,919
on the whiteboard

250
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,680
and someone else like no that's dumb

251
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
it's not that thing if it's anything

252
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,440
it's this other thing

253
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
and then 20 more people do it and all of

254
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,958
a sudden there's like eight avenues that

255
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
we never even explored

256
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,159
and this gets back to the power of play

257
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
because once all of a sudden we weren't

258
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,600
using a formal framework we weren't

259
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,959
trying to figure it out we weren't

260
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
trying to do something in a very static

261
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,839
way

262
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
people were like thinking differently

263
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,360
and guess what like number three on the

264
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
list was that santa

265
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
sucked and uh and and that better be a

266
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,720
thing

267
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,839
uh related story um on the tale of that

268
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,880
was the

269
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,399
prop maybe one of the best moments in my

270
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,920
professional career which is right after

271
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,959
the cio is like

272
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,640
okay everyone cooler heads are going to

273
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
prevail whatever

274
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,600
our our storage manager uh was like five

275
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,040
minutes late because even up till like

276
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
four a.m or something it's like an 8 a.m

277
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,000
warrior meeting

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,760
he comes rolling in and on the way in

279
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,519
there's like a little side room

280
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
and uh for various reasons

281
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,279
our email administrator was on the phone

282
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,839
with uh with the storage company

283
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,399
and uh and he goes oh i think someone

284
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,600
deleted some luns

285
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,560
and our in our uh and our storage

286
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,399
administrators walking by and he hears

287
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,760
this

288
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,800
and goes completely ballistic so the

289
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,920
thing about our war room that you should

290
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,440
know is a big long room and there's a

291
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,120
door in the front a door in the back

292
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
so our cio is like oh yeah cooler heads

293
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,399
are going to prevail blah blah blah blah

294
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,680
and literally five seconds later

295
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
our storage like uh lead storage admin

296
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,279
comes in goes who has

297
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,240
access to and he starts swearing and

298
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,760
he's like i'm gonna remove

299
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,279
i will murder all of you and

300
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,040
i've never seen it before and this

301
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,279
dude's the cio and the chief procurement

302
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,399
officer and the chief

303
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,839
operations officer because like there's

304
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,200
a whole bunch of stuff going on but he's

305
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,079
like

306
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,519
definitely number two at the company and

307
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,720
number one's in san francisco and we're

308
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
in pittsburgh

309
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
and and like and this dude's had a bad

310
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,680
week right he's had a rolling storage

311
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
out here for a week no one can fix

312
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,000
and we just see the cio stand up

313
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,640
and quietly back out of the back door

314
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,760
because what's he gonna do

315
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,279
he's not gonna destroy the dude that's

316
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,040
been working his ass off trying to fix

317
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,600
this thing

318
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
so anyway there's no moral to that

319
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,839
second one but it is hilarious

320
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
um

321
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,040
wow fair enough fair enough now it got

322
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,240
fixed later that day because we did the

323
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,959
betting poll

324
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,519
and whatever but and again i i cannot

325
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,519
stress this enough sand tap sucks

326
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
um it was actually sand tap was a swear

327
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
jar for the next three years at work

328
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,600
um all right so

329
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
do what else uh another kind of funny

330
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
story although it's sort of short

331
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
um probably anti-climactic but i will

332
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
remember in my last gig and some people

333
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
know this dude

334
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
ron beckman um he's like one of my very

335
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,839

why are you moving the chairs oh well

365
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,440
i asked facilities to do it a week ago

366
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,519
and they didn't do it

367
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,440
like okay but like the storage

368
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
building's in the other direction you're

369
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,800
walking towards the executive when you

370
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,240
say yeah

371
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
what are you doing he's like i'm putting

372
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,279
all the chairs from this part of the

373
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,399
office

374
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,839
into the cfo's office i'm like wait

375
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,680

376
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,800
56 chairs into the cfo's office

377
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,160
it's like oh okay uh i don't want to

378
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,079
help you anymore

379
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,760
because that sounds like a dangerous

380
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,279
career move

381
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,880
and uh and he ends up doing it

382
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
and uh and i remember being in his

383
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,639
office when he got the call

384
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,279
from the ceo and the ceo is like what

385
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,279
the hell are you doing

386
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
because oh i moved he's a very honest

387
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,399
dude ron if you know him

388
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,839
oh i moved 56 chairs into the cfo's

389
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,760
office and then the cfo came along and i

390
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,000
had to stop

391
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
and uh he's like well why he's like well

392
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,959
we have to do this thing we could go

393
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,440
whatever

394
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
but the point is um again in the concept

395
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
of making waves

396
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,519
the next day the very next day

397
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
that entire part of the office was like

398
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
done renovated facilities did their

399
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,160
thing

400
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,279
so take no is the point right take

401
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,040
no and if you need to piss off a

402
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,839
few people

403
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,639
there's such a thing as good pain right

404
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,040
um

405
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,880
another related story same company

406
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,440
and i don't know if you and bollinger

407
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
and the rest were there at the time but

408
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,240
there was a

409
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,959
horrible couple days where we due to

410
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,320
some compliance

411
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,800
reasons had to roll out multi-factor

412
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,639
authentication in three days to a global

413
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,880
organization and it

414
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,760
sucked i think it was after you left

415
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,160
it was yeah oh it was it was after that

416
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
but it was uh

417
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,279
yeah it was due to a lot of money that

418
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,880
we would have been left on the table if

419
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,000
we hadn't done this

420
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
thing in a terrible way oh god

421
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,360
yeah it's a worse it's a it's a terrible

422
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
real life scenario

423
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,800
but the point is we uh we did the thing

424
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
like we built the plan

425
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
and like like half a day we had the plan

426
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,560
we communicated the organization and we

427
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,680
gave everyone like

428
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
the ability to self enroll and and all

429
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,399
that stuff and in three days

430
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,199
when like only 80 of the company had

431
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,360
done the thing

432
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,720
uh folks on my team were freaking out

433
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,160
right they're like oh my god we've been

434
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
doing like 20 hour shifts

435
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,160
getting mfa rolled out to everyone

436
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,839
because we were on top of it because we

437
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,440
knew we couldn't be the hold up

438
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,079
right if that was on us we'd be gone

439
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,279
later that week

440
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,800
so we uh

441
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
ultimately what happens so 80 of the

442
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
company enrolls that means 20 percent of

443
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,399
the company

444
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,839
one-fifth of the company that's a lot of

445
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,600
the company uh isn't going to be

446
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
enrolled in mfa

447
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
when we flip the switch and make it live

448
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,639
that's going to be a problem

449
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
but it's not going to be my problem

450
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,199
because here's the thing we gave

451
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
we we gave everyone a path we let them

452
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,800
self enroll we

453
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
every single day we were hounding people

454
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,320
on on stuff to do now

455
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
i will say it was not our problem that

456
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,839
night it was our problem the next

457
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,199
morning

458
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
but i was not going to work overnight

459
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
yes

460
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,040
uh manufacturing and services

461
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,160
yeah yeah yeah uh people were pissed

462
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,720
yeah

463
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,759
right and then i forwarded them all

464
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,639
three emails

465
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,160
like we had a we had a boilerplate all

466
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,680
three emails of what they had and i

467
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,880
would copy their manager on it

468
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,279
yeah take no but here's the thing

469
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,160
the concept

470
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,839
the fact here is there's a concept of

471
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,519
good pain right people are

472
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,160
super super super change resistant crazy

473
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,120
change resistant

474
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,199
if you give them a path and they still

475
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,759
don't do the thing

476
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,680
that's not your emergency that night

477
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,199
it's potentially your emergency the next

478
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,000
morning i made no

479
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,399
one work that third night at all but the

480
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,519
next morning

481
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,199
we got everyone set up and things were

482
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,880
fine and the next time we had to do kind

483
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,199
of an emergency rollout

484
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,360
wasn't an issue people listened they

485
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,600
knew we were gonna do the thing

486
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,560
so highly recommend it and you know but

487
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,680
a little bit of pain is a good thing

488
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,720
because people

489
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
are gonna be resistant to it

490
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,519
um what else oh i'm gonna tell the story

491
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,800
now about how i

492
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,399
took money away from my wife

493
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
it was before she was my wife and she

494
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
still married me which means i must be

495
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,519
cool

496
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,440
um but how much time do i have left all

497
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,839
right we're still okay

498
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
um

499
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,319
oh god we're gonna bring drinks up here

500
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,280
if that's the case

501
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,640
um so so

502
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,439
uh this is several jobs ago we have a uh

503
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,720
basically there's a dude on my team

504
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
that's super instrumental and

505
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,799
this dude's awesome and i try and poach

506
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,400
him every single job i go to

507
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,839
because he's just fantastic he's in my

508
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,240
rolodex and i'm really upset because i

509
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,520
recently reached out to him he's like oh

510
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
no my new company's treating me really

511
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,240
nice everyone has that voice when i'm

512
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,360
mocking them by the way

513
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,080
um but the company's really i'm happy

514
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,640
for him but i'm

515
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,000
also like a little bit pissed off he's

516
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
not gonna come work for me again

517
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,880
regardless

518
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,080
um he's awesome and i can't do my

519
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,720
thing without him and this dude's like

520
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
look man i just want like

521
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,880
two or three grand more a year just get

522
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,640
me to like an even number

523
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
do the thing off cycle raise and there's

524
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
like a lot going on he's done a lot

525
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,520
recently i'm like yeah i'll go to bat

526
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,880
for that

527
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,559
and the company's like nah not gonna do

528
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
it

529
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,679
um i guess long story short i throw a

530
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,679
complete fit

531
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,880
um not knowing that my wife my current

532
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,679
wife who

533
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,039
worked there at the time was on deck for

534
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,160
a raise and money

535
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
is a zero-sum game

536
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,320
so i throw a fit and uh end up

537
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,600
basically getting well that weekend

538
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
i get a call from the ceo which i did

539
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,320
not expect so like

540
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
i was very lucky i get a conference call

541
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
hey we're gonna give you a little more

542
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,360
money i'm like that's cool but like

543
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,480
i'm not gonna say no but i really need

544
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,559
like my buddy to have some money um in

545
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,840
the way i threw the fit before i guess

546
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
this is an important component

547
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,760
i said take it out of my salary because

548
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,720
you might as well

549
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
fire me right now if this guy isn't on

550
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,480
my team

551
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,000
and all he's asking for is two or three

552
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
grand so that resonated

553
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,080
um which was cool and you know if you're

554
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
willing to go to bat for your people

555
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,000
like that

556
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,120
they're gonna stay in your rolodex it's

557
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,240
a fact

558
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,679
i'll tell you i've made that threat

559
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,440
twice in my career

560
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,520
20-year career i really don't want to

561
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
ever do it more than once every 10 years

562
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,400
but i highly recommend you pull out that

563
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,559
card if you truly believe in a person

564
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
because it'll really send a message and

565
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
if they take it from you look you still

566
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,400
kind of win because they're the person

567
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,280
on your team is going to get what they

568
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
need

569
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
um and it also will tell you a very

570
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
important thing about the company you're

571
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,919
working for

572
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
but both times i've made that threat

573
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,600
i've uh

574
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,919
i've been successful this time ceo calls

575
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,880
me on the weekend hey we're gonna give

576
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
you some more money okay i need money

577
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
for my buddy okay my buddy's gonna get

578
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,120
money too i say buddy he worked for me

579
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,000
it doesn't matter

580
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,039
um so

581
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,799
what i find out the next day is some

582
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,400
promotions were delayed one of which was

583
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,760
my wise

584
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,160
promotion and i hear about that all the

585
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
time now

586
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,039
whenever we're gonna buy new things

587
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,000
anyway

588
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
that's a story but the point is go to

589
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,039
bad for your people

590
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,919
um but also kind of be aware of some of

591
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,919
the unintended repercussions when you

592
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,360
really throw a fit

593
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,480
because you might get what you want

594
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
but it might you know it there's gonna

595
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,679
be potentially some political

596
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,880
consequences you need to be willing to

597
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,320
pay for them i still think it was the

598
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,440
right thing i just think

599
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
that the company didn't really tell me

600
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,159
they're gonna take money from someone

601
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,200
else

602
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,520
uh what else what else i'm like

603
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,120
i have a couple downers i'm not to bring

604
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,880
the room down too much

605
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
talk to me over beers if you want to

606
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
hear other good lessons but they're sad

607
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,480
oh me oh how many people here think

608
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
meetings are the best tool for getting

609
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,200
things done i see one

610
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,000
no one else

611
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
things done and get things done in

612
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
general

613
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
so this is why meetings are my favorite

614
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
tool for getting things done because

615
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,080
in all my meeting invites i say by the

616
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,679
way if you do the

617
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,679
before we have the meeting we don't have

618
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,679
to have this meeting

619
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,679
and you know what always happens the

620
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,200
 is done before the meeting

621
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
occurs

622
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
not a huge lesson but it is a trick i

623
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,559
use literally always

624
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,799
and i highly recommend others use this

625
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,480
trick

626
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,440
dude threats work well you have to pick

627
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,320
your

628
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,080
yet it's a generous threat it's

629
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,760
charismatic evil

630
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,679
you gotta like you make it sound like a

631
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,120
favor

632
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,200
right because you've already like the

633
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
the secret you've already taken their

634
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,919
time it's already scheduled on their

635
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,200
calendar so now they're like oh i

636
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,320
don't want to do this thing

637
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,120
you've already done the bad thing you're

638
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,840
giving them a

639
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,400
path out of the bad thing so anyway

640
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,640
highly recommended

641
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,480
yeah extortion works yes yes

642
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,880
uh c ransomware conversations earlier uh

643
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,000
all right we talked about that we talked

644
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,370
about that we talked about that um

645
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,720
[Music]

646
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,240
oh hire lazy people

647
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,520
yeah hi lazy people so um

648
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,480
brutal um so

649
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,559
i mean there's like a bill gates quote

650
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,679
about this but i actually didn't know

651
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,840
the bill gates quote like before i

652
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,960
was like talked to a bunch of people

653
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,280
about this but the point is like lazy is

654
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,159
basically

655
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,880
the the bad connotation of efficient if

656
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,559
you hire some smart people

657
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,880
that want to do not a lot of work

658
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
they're gonna find a way to do not a lot

659
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,320
of work and that usually means creative

660
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
automation that usually means

661
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
cool process changes that usually means

662
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
a bunch of

663
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
neat things that like you might not have

664
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,520
thought of because

665
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,640
hopefully you're trying to be lazy in

666
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,720
your own way um

667
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,559
so hire lazy people i think that's like

668
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,000
all the good stuff i have i can keep

669
