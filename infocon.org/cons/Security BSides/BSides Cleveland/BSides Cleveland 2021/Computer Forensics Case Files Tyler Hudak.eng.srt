brontosaurus i just think it's cool who

38
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,879
was just talking about brontosaurus

39
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,720
i just learned this yesterday from that

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
guy right there

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,160

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
brontosaurus

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
uh categorized the first thing in

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
zoology categorized

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
is the official name someone took the

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
main mistake and they took basically the

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
pedicle's body and put on a

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,519
big it was a primary sword head so they

49
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,879
put the wrong head on the wrong bodies

50
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,560
that water source never actually existed

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,599
it was a combination of two different

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,879
bone sets so it's been

53
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
kind of discontinued and what we

54
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,840
normally think of the voice is

55
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,019

although i have been doing research for

81
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
a while it's called computer forensics

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720

um you know i will absolutely talk about

103

trusted sex just because of the nature

104
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,919
of this

105
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,160
um i'm kind of doing this on my own so

106

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,639
about you know why why am i doing this

109
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,280
um i'm sure you've all heard the uh the

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,800
phrase that goes something like those

111
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,479
who cannot remember the past are

112
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,240
condemned to repeat it there are lots of

113
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,039
different

114
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,680
uh versions of this the earliest that i

115
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
could find this attribution to was

116
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
george santayana who was an irish

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
novelist poet so on winston churchill

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
said something very similar there are a

119
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,240
couple other people who kind of took

120
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,400
that quote and made it their own as well

121
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,520
um but you know when

122
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,039
one of the things that i found is that

123
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,639
in computer forensics

124
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
um computer forensics is used a lot

125
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,759
nowadays

126
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,440
pretty much every case you uh look at

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,360
or that that happens either in the

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,639
public or the private

129
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,479
computers uh computer forensics are

130
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
involved somehow but it's been going on

131
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,840
for a long time

132
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
you know computer forensics isn't a new

133
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
science it's still really young

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
and so because of that there are a lot

135
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,120
of really really

136
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,680
interesting cases that are out there

137
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
that have actually been talked about

138
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,039
publicly or semi-publicly

139
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,560
that we can actually learn a lot from

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,000
even though these cases may have

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,560
happened

142
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
years ago they they can still teach us

143
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,160
things

144
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,280
and so i'm going to talk about three of

145
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,000
those cases right now the first case

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,479
is or the first two cases are publicly

147
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,840
available the knowledge is publicly

148
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,560
available

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
um the third case is one that i actually

150
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
worked

151
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
probably i think it's about a decade ago

152
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
it has been talked about publicly by

153
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,400
myself

154
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,360
and others on my team at that time so i

155
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
feel comfortable talking about it

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
um it's not gonna hurt anybody by me

157
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
talking about this and so on

158
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,000
um just kind of a i probably don't need

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
to put this in here but you know

160
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
just trigger warning you know we are

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
going to be talking about murder and

162
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,440
porn

163
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,039
um i know that that might set some

164
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,319
people off i'm not going to show any

165
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
graphic images i'm not going to have any

166
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,039
graphic descriptions

167
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,960
there is some obscene text in here but

168
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,639
just wanted to you know throw that out

169
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,039
there

170
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,560

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
what i'm going to be talking about i

182
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
actually i know some of this is going to

183
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
be new because i actually interviewed

184
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,639
the

185
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,360
forensic analyst who worked on the case

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,759
but

187
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,960
to get into it the background so wichita

188
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,800
kansas 1974 january 15th of 1974.

189
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,440
four members of the otira family i'm

190
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,160
assuming that i'm

191
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
pronouncing that right if i mispronounce

192
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,199
any names which i probably will i

193
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,080
apologize

194
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,639
um but four members of the otero family

195
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
were murdered in their home

196
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,440
uh this was uh you can imagine 1970s

197
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,879
early 1970s

198
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,800
uh this probably isn't happening a lot

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
there's not a lot of you know murders

200
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
it's not at least not as talked about uh

201
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
as much as you know we have on

202
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,199
today with social media and and almost

203
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,440
instant news everywhere

204
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,919
the the four members are there um they

205
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,280
were actually discovered by

206
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
three of their children as they came

207
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
home from school uh and these weren't

208
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,839
you know just somebody getting killed

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
these were pretty horrific murders

210
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,080
um as time went on uh in 1974

211
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
there were three other murders uh

212
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,920
kathleen brights in

213
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,959
april uh shirley van uh vian

214
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,760
relford in march of 77 and then in

215
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
december of 77

216
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
nancy fox the police

217
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
were first i i believe that they

218
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
uh were not able to connect these right

219
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,519
away

220
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,959
but soon they were because

221
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,360
the killer uh started to toy with him he

222
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,600
started to leave them messages in fact

223
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
i believe the first message that he left

224
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
he put a letter in the um in a

225
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
engineering book in the wichita public

226
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,519
library

227
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,240
uh let's somebody i i don't think it was

228
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
the police i think he called

229
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
the local news station which was k-a-k-e

230
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,040
uh out there uh and let them know that

231
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,320
there was that letter there they went

232
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,279
and got it

233
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,480
and uh that's how he uh first claimed

234
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
the murder um so this went on for a long

235
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
time from 1977 to 1991

236
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
the btk killer murdered a total of 10

237
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,240
people

238
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
that he at least claimed or they were

239
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,279
able to

240
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,760
connect to him now the police weren't

241
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
just sitting around

242
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,399
trying to uh not do anything they

243
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,080
made multiple attempts to try to catch

244
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
him in one case and you can

245
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,600
read about all this publicly there are

246
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,079
books written about this i think in

247
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,360
the this if you watch the series

248
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,120
manhunter one of the main killers was

249
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,720
based on btk

250
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120
but they made lots of attempts to try to

251
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,839
catch him

252
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
uh in one attempt they actually did a

253
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
trap and trace with a

254
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
phone call that he made to one of the

255
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,720
local news stations

256
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
they were actually able to trace it back

257
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,800
and remember this is 1977

258
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,760
or in 1970s 1980s it's not like you can

259
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,320
just

260
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
you know it's not like you know ncis or

261
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
csi where they're gonna you know

262
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,279
you have like multiple people on the

263
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,519
keyboard writing visual basic

264
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
and going in and you know tracing it

265
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
back you with those little lines that

266
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,200
kind of jump around this is like

267
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,959
literally having people at the different

268
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,480
stations trying to figure out

269
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,720
who or where those calls are coming from

270
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
but they were able to trace it back to a

271
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,680
phone booth

272
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
uh in somewhere in wichita that he had

273
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,240
called from unfortunately by the time

274
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,279
the police got there he

275
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,360
obviously was not there in another

276
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
case uh another time he actually called

277
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,800
9-1-1 to

278
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,959
report one of the murders i believe it

279
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,519
was for nancy fox

280
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,720
he called 9-1-1 had

281
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,000
and basically said that there was a

282
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
murder at or he said something along the

283
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
lines of you'll find a murder at

284
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,240
and gave the address and then hung up

285
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
they actually record this you can

286
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,640
actually go and listen to it

287
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
unfortunately they weren't able to do

288
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,079
any type of

289
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,800
voice matching or anything like that

290
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,279
because

291
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,040
the tape recorder that they taped it on

292
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
again you know 70s 80s

293
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
they didn't have automated uh recording

294
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
systems it was actually recorded on a

295
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,440
tape recorder and for some reason the

296
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,480
tape recorder

297
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,920
like taped things slowly or something

298
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
like that so the voice was distorted and

299
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
so they were in other words the police

300
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
were having trouble you know trying to

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
uh trying to catch him

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,320
um in one of the letters that he sent

303
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,399
um and so i don't

304
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,800
i cannot confirm that and so i've tried

305
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,360
to go and try to find like the actual

306
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,120
letters and newspaper articles around

307
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
this and try to confirm as much as i can

308
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,120
um but in one of the letters he ends it

309
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
with saying since sex

310
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,079
criminals do not change their mo or by

311
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,399
nature cannot do so let me say two

312
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,600
i had somebody review this and they

313
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
started correcting all the errors in the

314
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,839
quotes

315
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,440
these are actual quotes you know any

316
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
mistakes in these quotes are not my own

317
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,079
um but since sex criminals do not change

318
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,399
their mo or by nature cannot do so

319
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
i will not change mine the code words

320
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,519
for me will be bind them

321
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
torture them see spell that misspelled

322
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
that kill them btk

323
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,120
you can see uh he added again they will

324
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,720
be on the next victim and so he kind of

325
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
named himself this is where his name

326
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,440
came from this was

327
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
in one of his letters i'm not sure if

328
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
this was the first letter that he sent

329
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
or the second i wasn't able to confirm

330
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
that one way or another

331
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
but in each time he would uh you know

332
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
eventually leave these and so that's how

333
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,560
they were able to

334
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,279
uh kind of you know uh come up with his

335
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,000
mo

336
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
um and you know just to you know kind of

337
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,360
state it again these are not just

338
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
you know somebody just going and

339
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,000
murdering somebody with a knife or

340
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,480
something

341
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,639
they're pretty horrific there's torture

342
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,079
elements there's sexual elements to

343
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,959
these killers

344
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,040
so they the police to these murders so

345
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
the police really wanted to catch him

346
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,160
unfortunately so from 1991

347
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
until 2004 the case went cold he didn't

348
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,240
murder anyone or at least they didn't

349
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,639
find

350
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,680
anybody that they could tie to him and

351
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,079
then

352
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,760
march 17th 2004 the btk contacted the

353
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,959
media again

354
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,360
now the interesting thing about this was

355
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,600
this was the 30th anniversary of the

356
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,920
otero family murders his first murders

357
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,240
i again have not been able to confirm

358
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,000
this i have read

359
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
that the reason he started up again or

360
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,519
at least

361
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,399
the reason he started contacting the uh

362
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:48,720
the

363
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
the police and the media again is

364
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,079
because one of the

365
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,360
wichita newspapers did an article

366
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
on the 30th anniversary of the murders

367
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
on btk

368
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,760
and basically talked about how they had

369
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,079
never

370
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,279
caught him and they i believe that they

371
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,959
reasoned that you know he might be dead

372
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,480
which is why he went silent

373
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
and obviously you know serial killers or

374
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
a lot of serial killers have pretty big

375
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,519
egos

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,120
uh he couldn't let that stand so he

377
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,560
started toying with the police and the

378
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
media again

379
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,880
um uh this is one of the letters that he

380
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,199
said

381
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
you can't really see it right here but

382
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,959
he actually sent it from

383
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,320
bill thompson killman is who the address

384
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,800
was

385
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
the return address was to so again you

386
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,399
know he's toying with them uh

387
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,839
pretty uh pretty hard um he did this in

388
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
a couple of different ways

389
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,480
uh in he kind of changed instead of

390
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
sending letters uh he did it with the

391
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
first one

392
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,040
he would actually send um take like

393
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,480
cereal boxes

394
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
and put uh create um particularly barbie

395
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,880
dolls

396
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,000
and do reenactments of his murders or

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
his torture in there along with a little

398
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
note and he would just throw them in

399
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,240
random places

400
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
in one case he threw it in the back of a

401
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
some somebody's uh

402
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
truck at home depot um they ended up

403
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,839
throwing that away and then he didn't

404
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,120
hear anything so he contacted the police

405
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,639
and they actually had to go and dig it

406
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
out of the trash and things like that

407
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
um so he would he was you know

408
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,720
communicating with the police this way

409
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,320
just kind of upping his game

410
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,639
uh he as far as i know he didn't murder

411
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,160
anybody at this time

412
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
um although uh from what i understand he

413
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,519
was definitely planning it he was

414
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,279
hinting at the police that he had

415
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,760
pulled he had targeted some people um

416
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,279
and this is what he would do he would

417
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,720
stalk people he would you know get to

418
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,279
know them

419
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,199
uh figure out who they were their their

420
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,600
uh um

421
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
their routines and so on and that's how

422
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,279
what he would do

423
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,639
now in one of the um

424
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
in one of the uh letters he asked

425
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,440
which he sent to the news station he

426
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
liked to communicate with k aka sorry

427
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,399
that's a little blurry

428
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,399
uh but he asked can i communicate with

429
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,320
floppy and not be traced to a computer

430
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,000
be honest

431
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,680
so what do you think the police said to

432
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,639
this exactly they said yes we cannot

433
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,639
trace you if you send us a floppy disk

434
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,880
and what's interesting too is they were

435
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
actually um

436
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
communicating back and forth the uh ads

437
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,560
in the newspaper

438
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,000
uh again i have not been able to find

439
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
these ads i really want to find these

440
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,240
ads

441
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,920
um but uh they that's what they did the

442
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
place of course said no there's no way

443
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,079
that we can

444
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,079
we can trace you back to a floppy now

445
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,120
understand too

446
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,720
this is 2004 so this is what 15 years

447
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,199
ago

448
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,160
if i'm doing four 16 years ago

449
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
remember where we were 16 years ago

450
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,160
you know i think windows xp was out uh

451
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
maybe

452
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
that sounds about right uh i can't

453
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,759
remember vista may have just been coming

454
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,240
out

455
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,000
floppy disks were still standard in

456
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
computers

457
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,240
cd-roms were not always standard i think

458
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
they were starting to become that so

459
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
you can imagine you know just remember

460
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,959
back then uh

461
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
the internet is still fairly new not a

462
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,000
lot of people have it or they

463
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,040
may have aol and so um even more

464
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,160
importantly

465
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,280
computer forensics is a extremely new

466
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,319
science

467
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,240
nobody is really doing this maybe the

468
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,679
government maybe some like

469
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,160
well-funded police stations and case is

470
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
the number one you know tool it's really

471
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
one of the only tools out there for this

472
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,599
there are a couple others but not as

473
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,079
well accepted so

474
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,280
it's not like you know you have the

475
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,119
ability to you know download

476
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,199
linux sift and you know stick that

477
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
floppy and make an image and go and go

478
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,000
at it you know there's

479
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,960
uh nobody really has that capability but

480
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,360
you know to continue on with the story

481
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
btk you know asked this police said yes

482
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
of course and so

483
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
on february 16 2005 they received a

484
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,760
package i can't remember how they got it

485
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
but the package contained a floppy disk

486
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,320
um i found this image i think this might

487
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,960
actually be

488
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
an image of the actual um floppy disk

489
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,559
and i just want to say one thing about

490
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,080
this first off

491
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,720
how many people here actually use three

492
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,640
and a half inch floppy disks

493
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,840
all right good i don't feel that old

494
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
then um

495
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,799
this floppy disk i remember it and it

496
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,640
these types if i remember right they

497
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,320
were like sold at like the

498
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,679
teeny bopper boutiques in the mall so

499
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,600
kind of gives you a little bit about the

500
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
the attacker right there the btk

501
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,360
um not saying he's not you know

502
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,440
masculine but you know what if you have

503
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,120
to shop there for floppy disks

504
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,240
but in any case um this disc led

505
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,480
directly led to the capture of the

506
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,360
killer

507
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
uh which i find you know extremely

508
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,400
fascinating you you have

509
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
at this point 30 plus years of the

510
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,160
serial killer

511
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,440
out and he's taken down by a floppy disk

512
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,480
so how did that happen um so i talked to

513
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,280
randy stone

514
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,360
who was the forensic investigator on the

515
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,880
case uh if you go

516
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,480
and you read a lot of articles about how

517
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
he was captured they kind of hint at

518
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,480
this

519
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,600
but they always talk about the lead

520
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
detective and i apologize i don't

521
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
remember the lead detective's name

522
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,720
he passed away a couple years ago but i

523
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,559
was able to figure out that randy stone

524
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,080
was the forensic investigator who did

525
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,039
the actual

526
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,000
hands-on analysis of this disc he is

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,280
actually the director of incident

528
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
response for stras freeburg so if you

529
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,240
know who they are they are a huge

530
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,280
company that does

531
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
ir and forensics and lots of other

532
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,320
things

533
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,919
he was nice enough to let me conduct an

534
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,520
interview with him over linkedin

535
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
and that's another cool thing about this

536
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
um looking at the history of this you

537
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,679
know if we

538
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,880
if we wanted to do a kind of a you know

539
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,320
forensics history

540
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,919
of something like you know jack the

541
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,440
ripper or uh

542
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,640
even like the eased out woman which

543
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
happened in i think the 60s or 70s

544
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,080
um some of those people who did those

545
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,919
cases they're long gone

546
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
they're dead the evidence is gone the

547
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,120
the forensic

548
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,280
uh the computer forensics cases that i'm

549
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,720
talking about here and actually most of

550
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,679
them

551
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
the people who did them are still around

552
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,799
they're still working we can reach out

553
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,600
to them on

554
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,520
you know twitter on facebook on linkedin

555
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,720
and actually ask them

556
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,080
you know what did you do how did you do

557
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,200
this and you know assuming that they're

558
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,480
allowed to talk about this

559
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,640
and so that's what i did i asked randy

560
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,160
you know what how did you do this you

561
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,360
know what did you do i was

562
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,799
kind of expecting like some something

563
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,880
really cool here uh and but it was

564
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,760
really simple

565
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,679
he took the the floppy disk he imaged it

566
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,360
within case which is good you know he

567
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,200
followed proper standard procedures

568
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,520
of not working on the original uh floppy

569
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,559
disk

570
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,760
um as he was looking through the disk

571
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,200
i i think the note the btk left them was

572
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
in a text file or something like that

573
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,320
however

574
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,679
they were able to recover a deleted word

575
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,320
document

576
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,120
on the disk so you know he looked for

577
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,600
not just

578
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
you know what was on this he tried to

579
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
recover files and found this word

580
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,760
documents

581
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
so he opened a copy of the document so i

582
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,760
asked him you know about this

583
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
you know how did he analyze this word

584
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,640
document because i just said oh i would

585
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
i was going to open it in a hex editor

586
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,720
i was going to do all this he told me

587
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,600
that he

588
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
basically had a bunch of people standing

589
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,840
behind him as he was doing this

590
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,159
so you can imagine this is a huge case

591
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,799
uh he probably has the chief of police

592
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,440
he has the lead investigator he probably

593
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
you know maybe has somebody from like

594
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,440
city council

595
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
you know maybe even the mayor or

596
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
somebody like that all these people just

597
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,919
kind of sitting behind him so imagine

598
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,520
you're trying to analyze something

599
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
or i'm sure you know everybody's had

600
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
this you know for the pentesters in here

601
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,080
when you're doing your work the client's

602
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,360
like standing over your shoulder seeing

603
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
what you're doing things like that

604
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
imagine that so he told me that he

605
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,480
wanted to do something really cool like

606
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
open it up in a hex editor

607
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,200
and you know just kind of go through the

608
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,799
bits and bytes to impress everybody but

609
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,080
he literally just opened it up and

610
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,799
worked

611
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,840
um when he did that he went to

612
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,480
the metadata so how many people in here

613
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
are pen testers

614
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,280
have do like osa how many of of those

615
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,320
sorry how many of you go and

616
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,400
um before you do like a pen test you do

617
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
uh open source

618
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,440
intelligence scanning and pull metadata

619
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,640
out of documents

620
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
metadata is super powerful and literally

621
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
that's what he did he just went

622
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,480
to the the file properties uh in word

623
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,200
and he found

624
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,320
two key things first it was uh

625
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
uh had been created at a location called

626
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,159
christ lutheran church

627
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,679
and it was this document was last

628
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,280
modified by somebody named

629
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,720
dennis this very quickly

630
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,200
uh led to them finding dennis rader who

631
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,559
was the btk killer

632
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,799
uh raider was the president of the

633
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
church council

634
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,320
they were able to tie a lot of evidence

635
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,480
to him and in one particular case

636
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,440
uh the uh where he when he dropped off

637
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,720
one of the packages

638
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,320
uh that he uh that he was showing with

639
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,919
police they saw him i think uh

640
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,760
they saw the person driving off in a

641
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,280
black uh cherokee

642
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,679
uh when they went when they drove by his

643
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,600
house they saw that he owned a black

644
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,480
cherokee

645
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
uh they actually um subpoenaed his

646
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,880
daughter to for dna

647
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,120
uh i can't remember how they got her to

648
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,159
do it they didn't say it was

649
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,640
for murders um but they got her dna and

650
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,000
were able to create the match

651
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,520
that way to the dna they had collected

652
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
at various scenes so they were able to

653
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,559
very quickly

654
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,600
uh arrest him after that

655
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
so first off you know i just again want

656
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,799
to say how cool is it that the

657
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,320
the serial killer who had been at large

658
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,400
for 30 plus years

659
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,159
they caught him because of metadata

660
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,240
metadata in a word document that he

661
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,760
thought he had deleted

662
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,520
which i just think is just so freaking

663
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,760
awesome all right so what can we learn

664
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
from this case

665
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,679
um first off you know data is never

666
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,880
deleted i i think that's

667
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
we probably know that uh or at least

668
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,240
hopefully we know that if not you know

669
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,880
it now

670
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
um you know when you delete a file on a

671
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,280
disk or on a drive it's not gone

672
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,360
you know windows doesn't overwrite those

673
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,919
bytes um you need another program or a

674
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,840
special deletion program to do that

675
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,159
and so it's it is possible to recover

676
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,200
data from

677
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
uh from disks it's possible to recover

678
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,360
files and even if you can't recover the

679
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,720
whole file you can recover bits and

680
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,280
pieces

681
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
and that's why we do in forensics that's

682
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
where we do keyword searches

683
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
across an entire disk looking at the

684
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
slack space we might

685
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
find uh something that's uh you know

686
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
just kind of a key indicator that just

687
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
gives us that little piece of

688
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,080
information that we can then pivot off

689
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,400
of

690
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
you know granted you know floppy disks

691
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,640
three and a half floppy disks were 1.44

692
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,520
megabytes

693
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,039
you know our average disk that we look

694
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,799
at at least you know in the cases that i

695
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,080
work are usually

696
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,120
you know 64 128 256 gigabytes so you

697
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,480
know you're dealing with a lot more data

698
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,120
now but

699
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
you know this is the key thing to

700
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,919
remember here is data is never deleted

701
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,480
well actually

702
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,760
i guess the key thing here to remember

703
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,679
is if you're a serial killer don't you

704
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:11,919
know

705
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,279
ask the police if they can trace you

706
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,799
because they're going to say no but

707
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,159
the next thing is look everywhere for

708
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,559
evidence um you know in a lot of cases

709
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,039
that i work or that that my team works

710
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,640
um you know we're very focused in

711
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
incident response you are

712
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,200
you have to be laser focused because you

713
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
are in a critical situation

714
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,039
there is you know panic going on there's

715
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,720
chaos going on and you need to find some

716
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,559
answers very quickly so we often don't

717
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,120
have to

718
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,960
have time to do a complete forensic

719
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,559
analysis of any systems

720
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
however um you know there while there

721
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
are key places that we look

722
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,919
in in forensics you you kind of have to

723
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,120
at some point have to kind of take a

724
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,000
step back and look

725
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,679
everywhere if randy stone had not

726
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,880
gone and looked for deleted

727
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,799
files on the disk or you know deleted

728
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
data on the disk if he had just you know

729
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,400
threw that floppy end and looked and saw

730
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,080
a text file and that was it and give

731
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,120
given up from there

732
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
you know he probably would not have you

733
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
know found uh or broken the case

734
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
open so you need to really look

735
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,960
everywhere for evidence

736
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
next metadata is powerful it is

737
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,400
absolutely powerful

738
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
you know i i think we know this um

739
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,720
either on the forensic side the incident

740
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
response side when

741
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,559
uh a lot of times uh we work uh business

742
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,400
email compromise cases these wire

743
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,159
transfer fraud cases and

744
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,919
in these cases the the attackers will

745
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,679
send over pdf documents

746
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,120
uh and you know not only trying to

747
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,559
figure out you know are those pdf

748
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,279
documents

749
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,640
malicious and we're trying to figure out

750
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
you know where do they come from and

751
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,600
metadata is key for that

752
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,279
uh in addition to that you know

753
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,559
obviously with penthouse you know you

754
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,679
can find a lot of information like

755
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,200
usernames email addresses

756
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,880
uh things like that from the metadata of

757
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,039
documents so metadata is super powerful

758
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,159
um if you work in an organization

759
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,120
it's not a bad idea to maybe you know

760
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,320
talk to some people

761
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,520
especially your legal department they

762
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,360
may already have the setup to install

763
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
like plugins or programs that

764
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,159
automatically delete

765
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,480
metadata out of documents um there are

766
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,279
some

767
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,600
word now has has some ways to do that

768
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,120
automatically

769
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,360
but um you know you may not want to have

770
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,039
that information leaked out and so

771
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,640
you can you actually get programs that

772
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,080
will automatically delete this out for

773
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,679
you

774
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,360
and then finally learn when to ask for

775
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,120
help you know that really don't see that

776
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,880
in this particular case

777
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
but you know i asked randy um you know

778
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,640
what's

779
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,039
uh actually you know is there anything

780
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,559
that you would tell computer forensics

781
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:30,880
uh

782
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
our ir analyst today based on your

783
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
experience and i'm not gonna read that

784
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,120
whole thing but

785
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,240
it basically boils down to know when

786
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,080
you're in over your head

787
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,559
i see this a lot especially on my side

788
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,120
of

789
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,000
the industry on ir and forensics ir

790
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,679
forensics is huge

791
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,880
it's a huge space we don't always on my

792
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,080
team you know we have a

793
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,919
breadth of experience but we we're not

794
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,039
experiencing everything every once in a

795
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,039
while we get a call from a client

796
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,520
that says you know i've got this one

797
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,039
system over here that's been compromised

798
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,480
i need you to analyze it and we we

799
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,600
probably have never even heard of that

800
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,320
system

801
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,159
um so you know we know when we're in

802
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,520
overhead fortunately we have the

803
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,679
resources at lisa trustedsec that i can

804
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,320
go to our

805
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,520
our research team or our other pen

806
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
testers and somebody has had uh the

807
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
experience with that but

808
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,880
you know the big thing is you know know

809
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,080
when you're in over your head

810
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,559
don't be afraid to ask for help in this

811
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,919
industry there are so many people out

812
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,679
there i know a lot of people have egos

813
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,600
but you know even if you get into the

814
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,840
right discords and the right slacks or

815
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,520
or you know the right people on twitter

816
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,799
and ask them a question there are lots

817
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,080
of people who are more than willing to

818
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,880
help you out

819
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,679
so just kind of remember that any

820
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,399
questions on the first case so far

821
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,480
cool all right so we're gonna go to the

822
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,799
second case uh case of julie amero has

823
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,880
anybody heard of this one

824
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,159
oh cool all right um this is another one

825
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,200
that i found fascinating

826
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,039
um probably because i think one of the

827
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,720
reasons that i find both these cases

828
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,760
fascinating

829
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
is they both kind of broke around the

830
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,880
same time

831
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,559
and this is when i was really starting

832
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,480
my forensics and ir

833
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
career now i've been in security for you

834
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,080
know over 20 years since um

835
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,480
the mid-90s uh but i didn't get into

836
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,520
forensics until

837
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,159
you know early 2000s uh or so so this is

838
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,440
you know still fairly new to me so i

839
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
kind of latched onto these cases

840
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,200
but okay so julia maro uh julie was

841
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
a substitute teacher in the seventh

842
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,919
grade and on october 19 2004 again

843
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,520
remember this is early 2000's we're

844
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,360
dealing with windows xp

845
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,679
we're dealing with you know ie like what

846
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,159
3 or 4.0 you know

847
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,520
i don't even think firefox was called

848
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
firefox then it was probably still

849
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,440
called

850
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,960
what was it before yeah yeah whatever it

851
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,320
was called before mozilla

852
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
um so uh you know we're still dealing

853
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,360
with you know

854
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,159
the early age of you know uh forensics

855
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,039
um

856
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,200
on this date uh as she was teaching the

857
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,880
computer she was using started showing

858
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,159
pornographic images

859
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,919
to students or at least that's what was

860
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,720
said um there are some disputes as to

861
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,000
whether or not the students actually saw

862
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
this it wasn't like today where you have

863
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,520
a computer hooked up to a projector

864
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,919
i i believe based on the the pictures

865
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,440
that i've seen

866
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
uh she had a desk in the front of the

867
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,039
class there was a computer with

868
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,159
one a big you know crt monitor

869
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,240
um that was actually face towards her

870
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,679
not the students so there's actually

871
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,880
some dispute as to whether or not the

872
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,159
students actually saw anything

873
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
but um that's what she was charged with

874
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,360
um

875
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,760
the uh she ended up being charged with

876
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,080
uh a number of counts of risk of injury

877
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,240
to a minor which is actually a felony

878
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,559
uh where she was at so this is not a

879
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,919
light charge

880
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,360
um the whole case presumed around

881
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,760
that she showed the she went to the

882
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,960
links on purpose

883
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
and that she showed them to the students

884
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,399
or that she didn't make an effort

885
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,840
to hide them from the students

886
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,840
she went to trial on january 5th 2007

887
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,360
she was convicted

888
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,320
but sentencing was delayed uh but she

889
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,440
faced a maximum sentence of 40 years

890
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,919
so lots this is again this is not a

891
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,840
simple case this is not a

892
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,240
a fine and a slap on the hand we're

893
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,320
talking about serious time here

894
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,679
now at this point the the judge

895
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,600
and the prosecutor asked for sentencing

896
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,799
to be delayed

897
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,880
i could not find the exact reason why

898
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,799
but i think it basically boils down to

899
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,320
that they were not satisfied with some

900
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,200
of the evidence

901
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,000
that had been presented and so uh i

902
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,960
think some of the things that we're

903
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,320
going to talk about here

904
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,399
um kind of led to from that

905
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,600
but in any case sentencing was delayed

906
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,320
um on march 6 2007 so this started to

907
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,640
make

908
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,399
news it started to make national news

909
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,159
that this had happened and so uh

910
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,000
as people started looking into this they

911
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
started realizing

912
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,799
something's not right here you know

913
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,799
something is just isn't adding up

914
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,919
and so um on march 6 2007

915
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,360
there was an ad taken out in the

916
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,959
hartford currents uh this is a

917
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,840
this is what the ad said um i pulled

918
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,399
this off

919
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,440
of archive.org a lot of these sites

920
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,960
even though they really didn't happen

921
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,880
too long ago like like 15 years ago or

922
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,200
so

923
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,320
a lot of these articles in that they're

924
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,640
no longer on the sites and so um

925
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,440
the wayback machine was freaking amazing

926
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,559
for researching this

927
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,279
and um i i'll publish my uh these slides

928
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,559
too that i have all the links to

929
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,679
everything in here

930
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,559
but in any case uh in the hardware

931
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,200
current

932
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,240
um a open letter was sent out to

933
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,480
uh it was published by 28 computer

934
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,000
science professors from some major

935
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,120
universities

936
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,679
around the country such as yale uh

937
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,559
wesleyan

938
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,720
uh university of hartford and multiple

939
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,840
others and basically what it said is

940
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,279
it kind of came down to that you know

941
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,840
look we watched this cage we read

942
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,200
through the transcripts something isn't

943
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,000
adding up

944
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,799
um please have somebody do a for a kind

945
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,640
of independent analysis of this

946
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,120
and so this kind of plea went out to

947
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,039
anybody who has forensic experience to

948
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,840
you know take a look at this um with

949
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
that

950
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,120
on march 21st of that year so about two

951
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,159
weeks after that

952
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,159
uh multiple forensic analysts led by

953
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,440
alex eckleberry

954
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,600
uh of some built software uh reviewed

955
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
the evidence and published their opinion

956
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
i believe they worked with the defense

957
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,039
they were actually able to get

958
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,000
the image that was taken of the uh of

959
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,399
the

960
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,840
computer uh that all this happened on

961
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,399
um and they did a forensic analysis of

962
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,200
it and published

963
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,320
their their results um now

964
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,840
the thing to remember there were

965
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,960
two key things that helped lead to

966
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,399
amero's conviction

967
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,080
uh or actually two people who who um

968
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,880
uh testified that led to her conviction

969
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,399
uh the first was the norwich public

970
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,200
schools i.t

971
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,600
manager and then the norwich police

972
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,480
detective

973
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,840
their names are all over the place if

974
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,120
you go look at them i'm not up here to

975
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,080
shame anybody

976
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,919
so i didn't put their names in here um

977
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,200
now the reason she got so first thing

978
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,760
too

979
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,080
um you know a public schools i.t manager

980
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,360
definitely does not have forensic

981
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,960
training i can almost guarantee that i

982
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,399
talk to them all the time they they

983
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:06,880
don't

984
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,559
you know today police detective maybe

985
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,799
um you know probably not to the extent

986
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,080
that we would expect

987
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,960
uh but as uh the testimony showed he at

988
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,000
least

989
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
knew how to use some forensic software

990
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,039
and i'll get into that

991
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,480
now the reason she was convicted came

992
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,120
down to

993
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,559
two things um first is that

994
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,960
the jury was convinced or that she

995
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,559
purposely clicked on the link so in

996
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,039
other words

997
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,519
this wasn't an accident she had gone out

998
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,799
to these porn sites

999
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,559
she had clicked on the links and that is

1000
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,640
what ended up being on the screen

1001
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,559
and that she made no effort to hide it

1002
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,000
from the students

1003
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,600
um we're not really going to talk about

1004
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,919
the second part um there are a lot of

1005
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,480
different uh

1006
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,919
things about that it's not as

1007
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,440
interesting it doesn't really deal with

1008
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,559
the computer forensic stuff

1009
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,559
but we are going to you definitely dive

1010
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,600
into this first one

1011
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,360
you know that she purposely clicked on

1012
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,799
the links and we know this is true

1013
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,440
because

1014
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,279
one of the jurors actually gave an

1015
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,720
interview

1016
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,320
in 2007 talking about why she was

1017
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,079
convicted and

1018
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,760
when you read what he says it really

1019
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,839
does go into that she did this on

1020
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,879
purpose

1021
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,480
is what it came down to that she was the

1022
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,159
one who clicked on the links she was the

1023
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,359
one who went and did this

1024
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,879
she did it on purpose so therefore she

1025
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,440
must be punished

1026
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
um so the way i'm gonna do this is i'm

1027
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,199
going to instead of like going through

1028
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,399
and saying you know this is what the

1029
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,879
the you know the prosecution said this

1030
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,399
was testified and then go through

1031
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,760
everything else afterwards i'm going to

1032
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,679
kind of do a compare and contrast

1033
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,800
so um going through the evidence

1034
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,960
and all this again you can read in the

1035
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
the published opinion

1036
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,040
of the of the secondary analysis so the

1037
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,280
first uh the original claim was that

1038
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,679
sites from the temporary internet files

1039
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,520
directory on the disk were listed so in

1040
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,079
other words

1041
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,399
the uh the detective went in he went

1042
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,520
into the temporary

1043
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,160
temporary internet files directory and

1044
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,839
just listed all the websites that were

1045
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,680
in there

1046
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,000
the firewall logs were also examined and

1047
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,599
both of these combined were used to show

1048
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,839
evidence of access to the porn sites

1049
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,200
and intent the intent there is the key

1050
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,079
part

1051
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,760
so in other words uh when they were on

1052
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,440
the stand the

1053
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,839
the detective and the school manager

1054
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,040
essentially said

1055
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,640
you know the only way that they could

1056
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,079
they could be listed in these sites is

1057
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,280
because she clicked on those links

1058
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,839
well that really doesn't you know add up

1059
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,599
and again this is from the opinion and

1060
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,800
you know based on my experience doing

1061
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
forensic analysis

1062
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,839
this is true the internet cache the

1063
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,240
temporary internet files directory

1064
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,400
does show evidence of access you know if

1065
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
if a file is in there from a website

1066
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,960
somehow your computer went to that site

1067
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
you may not have done that but it went

1068
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,240
there

1069
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,880
but it does not show if it was accessed

1070
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,359
on purpose it does not show intent

1071
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,920
so think about when you go to a website

1072
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,599
how many ads are loaded

1073
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,359
how many images are loaded and those

1074
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,640
could be loaded from anywhere those are

1075
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,839
going to be stored in your internet

1076
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,560
cache

1077
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,079
does that mean you actually click on

1078
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,000
that link to go to that site no

1079
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,280
it just means that your browser or

1080
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,359
something on your computer went to that

1081
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,240
site

1082
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,440
uh the second is that the history file

1083
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,200
uh the index.dat so we're dealing with

1084
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,440
ie here uh back in 2004.

1085
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,680
um the index.history file was not

1086
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,480
examined

1087
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
so in other words the detective only

1088
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,839
looked at what was in the cache they did

1089
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,119
not look at the history they did not

1090
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,000
look at the cookies

1091
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,680
they did not look at any other aspects

1092
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,920
of the the browsing history

1093
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,440
just what was in the cache so this is an

1094
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,720
issue because again

1095
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,640
we're going back to intent here none of

1096
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,320
this is showing intent

1097
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,599
this is just showing that yes the

1098
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,359
computer went to these sites

1099
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,920
um the big thing here too is that you

1100
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,480
know again

1101
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
the porn links were clicked on this on

1102
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,160
the left hand side is the testimony i'm

1103
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,440
not going to read that what it boils

1104
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,079
down to

1105
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,440
is the the detective said that

1106
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
the links on the porn sites were a

1107
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,720
different color

1108
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,560
so what they did was they they they

1109
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,160
actually imaged the system with

1110
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
norton ghost does anybody remember

1111
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,200
norton ghost all right cool

1112
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,560
yeah you don't want to use norton ghost

1113
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
for forensics for forensic imaging

1114
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,880
i mean you can if you're like in a bind

1115
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,160
but that's not really the way to do it

1116
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,359
but that's what they used

1117
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,720
and so with norton ghost they were

1118
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,000
actually able to restore the computer

1119
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,880
somewhere else

1120
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,119
like booted up um and so they had

1121
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,079
actually done this

1122
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,320
and they had looked at the uh they had

1123
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
loaded up the pages

1124
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,400
uh and the detective said because the

1125
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,720
the

1126
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,640
links uh and i'll show a image of this

1127
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,480
in a second because the links on the

1128
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
porn sites were a different color

1129
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,800
therefore they uh she had clicked on

1130
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,520
them so

1131
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,920
if you recall you know i don't know how

1132
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,359
much this has done actually now because

1133
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:39,680
of

1134
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,599
css and all that but um

1135
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,520
back then you know most browsers if you

1136
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,720
clicked on a link it would change to a

1137
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,839
different color just to show that you

1138
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,119
had already gone there

1139
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,800
um their their reasoning here was

1140
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
because these links on on these sites

1141
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,599
were different color

1142
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,040
they were clicked on um on the right

1143
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,720
you really can't see that so i apologize

1144
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,400
it's probably better that you can't see

1145
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,040
this but

1146
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,160
um but this is an actual image of the

1147
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,240
uh of a screenshot that was taken from

1148
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,280
of that page

1149
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,599
um and you can kind of see here that one

1150
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,280
of these links is in bright red and

1151
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,560
that's what they were pointing to that

1152
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,640
because this link was in bright red she

1153
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,680
had clicked on it

1154
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,440
so she cannot say that she did not go to

1155
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,040
these sites yeah we have the evidence

1156
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,760
right here it visually shows that

1157
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,440
well as the forensic analysis was done

1158
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,560
independently

1159
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,320
they found that um you know first off

1160
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,359
the links uh that have uh

1161
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,200
what it comes down to is whether or not

1162
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,640
you click on them

1163
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,800
um if you've gone to a website or your

1164
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,160
computer has gone to a website in your

1165
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,920
history that link will change color so

1166
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,720
in other words

1167
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,119
if um i was on a web page and i had a

1168
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,320
link to a site

1169
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,200
if i manually typed in that link and

1170
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,560
then went back to that page that link

1171
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,680
would still

1172
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,839
be a different color um because you had

1173
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,359
gone to it it checks your history file

1174
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,640
for that

1175
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,800
but the big thing here was that they

1176
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,640
found that internet explorer

1177
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,240
on this computer was actually configured

1178
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,640
to show that visited links were in green

1179
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,040
would be shown in green not red the big

1180
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,560
thing here and they actually called this

1181
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,680
out in the

1182
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,880
uh in the trial that she visited this

1183
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,320
because it was red

1184
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,640
so what it comes down to unfortunately

1185
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,000
i.e on that computer

1186
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,160
it was it had actually the configuration

1187
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,599
had been changed by the

1188
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,480
schools so that if the um link had been

1189
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,920
visited it would actually be green

1190
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,000
not red so that kind of you know throws

1191
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,520
that out there

1192
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,599
additionally they analyzed the html

1193
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,920
source of the of that page of that link

1194
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,320
there

1195
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,960
and they had found that it was hard

1196
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,520
coded

1197
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
in that page that that link would be

1198
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,119
read so that's why it was read the

1199
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,880
website had coded it that way

1200
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
so this whole thing about in her

1201
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
clicking on the link had

1202
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,400
basically now gotten thrown out uh and

1203
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,119
that you know

1204
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,160
again kind of shows you know one of

1205
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,960
their their main

1206
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,359
uh kind of points here that she had you

1207
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,320
know

1208
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
gone and clicked on this link uh you

1209
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,079
know that that

1210
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,240
had been thrown out now another thing

1211
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,839
that they found was

1212
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,839
the tool that the the detective used was

1213
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,359
called uh computer copy they used

1214
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,079
computer

1215
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,280
professional that is the only tool that

1216
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,599
he

1217
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,800
used he basically loaded up the computer

1218
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,200
in

1219
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,520
uh computer cop and computer cop it will

1220
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,560
go through and it will

1221
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,720
find images it will find web pages you

1222
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,000
can do keyword searches

1223
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,920
and so he did that and basically only

1224
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,520
looked at the evidence that came back

1225
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,400
from that

1226
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,079
um he did not do any manual analysis

1227
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,640
he did not open up any other tools he

1228
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,920
only used this tool so there are a

1229
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,599
couple issues with that

1230
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,359
um the first is that at this point in

1231
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,880
time i don't even know

1232
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,680
now if it is but um it was not a widely

1233
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,240
accepted

1234
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,520
uh or used tool um

1235
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,640
i don't think it is now it's actually

1236
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,240
still around surprisingly i actually

1237
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,359
pulled this image

1238
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,560
from the 2007 version of the page

1239
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,240
um but yeah so uh it's uh it's still

1240
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,880
around

1241
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,240
um even the the uh

1242
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,720
the vendor came out and said that yes it

1243
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,079
will pull this evidence but it can't

1244
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,599
tell you intent it can't tell you why

1245
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,000
somebody

1246
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,560
why that's on the the computer it will

1247
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,920
show you that the image is there it'll

1248
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,839
show you that the html page is there but

1249
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,280
unfortunately it can't tell you why

1250
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,920
that's there

1251
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
uh there's just no way to determine that

1252
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
um and finally

1253
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,160
again the detective used no other tools

1254
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,119
he literally only relied on computer cop

1255
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,480
and you know when you're doing forensic

1256
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,560
analysis you can't do that

1257
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,640
um you know your tools are great i love

1258
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,480
tools you know tools give you you know

1259
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,839
really good information

1260
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,400
a couple years ago though harlan carvey

1261
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,440
coined this term

1262
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,640
if you don't know who harlan carvey is

1263
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
he's a really you know

1264
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,760
not famous but uh really popular um

1265
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,599
forensic person he teaches for sans and

1266
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,440
things like that um but he coined the

1267
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,200
term nintendo forensics and basically

1268
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,240
what this meant was

1269
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,839
you know as these tools come out as in

1270
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,680
cases getting more powerful as ftk is

1271
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,880
getting more powerful

1272
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,480
analysts are only learning how to use

1273
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
the tools they don't understand how what

1274
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,280
to do when that tool breaks

1275
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,880
and you need to understand that there

1276
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,480
are many times when i'm when i'm working

1277
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,079
on a case where i'm reviewing a report

1278
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,280
for one of my uh team members

1279
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,200
and they only look at it one way and

1280
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,720
i'll have like 50 questions

1281
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,400
around that did you look at it like this

1282
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,920
what about this you know this

1283
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,599
because everything that we look at it

1284
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,119
you know can go to court

1285
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,599
and this is a great example of that um

1286
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,319
you can't just

1287
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,839
you know if somebody's life is literally

1288
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,760
on the line here you know 40 years

1289
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,119
this woman was looking at being

1290
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,040
sentenced to um you know you need to

1291
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,960
look every way you can in order to you

1292
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,079
know find that data and confirm it

1293
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,720
but so you know the tools that you the

1294
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,839
detective used

1295
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,119
a little bit iffy finally um

1296
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,760
they made a claim that she had to have

1297
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,839
gone to these links because there was no

1298
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,000
malware on the system

1299
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,560
so they had claimed that uh the computer

1300
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,920
had inoculated i.t

1301
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,960
antivirus um on the on the computer

1302
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,920
and that it was up to date um and they

1303
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,040
also testified

1304
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,560
i think i don't think this was the

1305
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,000
detective who testified this i think

1306
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,599
this was the school manager

1307
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,319
um that malware or spyware is not

1308
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,240
capable of spawning uh

1309
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,040
pornographic pop-ups so there is no way

1310
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,960
that a spyware even if it was on there

1311
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,920
would be showing these you know

1312
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,119
pornographic images

1313
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,839
because we've never seen that um

1314
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,720
additionally

1315
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,640
endless loop pop-ups were not possible

1316
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,000
apparently what happened was

1317
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,319
uh she would go to like uh close the

1318
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,079
window and then another one would pop up

1319
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,440
or like two more would pop up and so

1320
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,640
every time she tried to close one of

1321
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,040
these

1322
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,520
uh you know sites uh showing this porn

1323
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,720
you know another one would pop

1324
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,240
up and they testified well no that's not

1325
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,680
possible you know what she what she's

1326
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,599
describing is not even possible

1327
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,040
which again you know i'm sure we've

1328
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,880
never seen so what it came down to was

1329
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,000
malware was not on the system well

1330
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,480
when they did the analysis found a

1331
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,599
couple things

1332
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,760
first the antivirus was no longer

1333
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,839
supported by the vendor

1334
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,119
in fact it had been discontinued and so

1335
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,520
while remember this happened in october

1336
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
the last signature that occurred

1337
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,200
uh last signature update that occurred

1338
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,680
was in june 30th four months prior

1339
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,040
um and that was the last time the vendor

1340
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,560
had even released signatures so there

1341
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,000
was at least four months

1342
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,160
where they thought it was getting

1343
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
updated but it actually wasn't

1344
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,599
um and then of course spyware is was

1345
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,079
uh 100 capable of displaying porno

1346
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:14,960
pop-ups

1347
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,880
um it's absolutely possible

1348
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,640
um this uh is just kind of a screenshot

1349
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,640
from again the the opinion that was

1350
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,800
published uh showing that the

1351
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,640
they actually again because ghosts they

1352
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,079
were able to you know boot up that

1353
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,880
computer

1354
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,359
uh they were able to uh show that you

1355
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,240
know in fact

1356
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,319
the last signature was months prior to

1357
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,440
this happening

1358
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,079
um the uh and in fact the detective even

1359
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,680
admitted he did not look on the computer

1360
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,040
for any type of malware

1361
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,240
or spyware anything like that um so he

1362
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,680
didn't even go and look for it he just

1363
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,920
so

1364
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,760
again solely relying on what computer

1365
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,920
comp told him

1366
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,400
so was there spyware well yeah of course

1367
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,240
um so the new analysis found that there

1368
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,520
was a spyro program called

1369
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,079
new.net on the system so the way that

1370
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,040
new.net works

1371
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,040
is it is a um a cert a browser search

1372
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,480
hijacker so essentially what would

1373
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,119
happen is

1374
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,960
you know back then and even now um

1375
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,240
people would uh in

1376
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,640
in the browser uh i can't remember what

1377
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,240
it's called where you type in the url

1378
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,520
instead of typing in the url they would

1379
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,359
type in their search what would happen

1380
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,480
is the new.net would intercept that um

1381
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,680
because it would generate an error page

1382
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,960
they would intercept that error page and

1383
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,760
then show them what

1384
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,079
show the um the the person who had this

1385
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,440
installed what you know they

1386
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,280
what what the spyware wanted them to see

1387
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,359
it was actually discovered that this was

1388
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,839
installed five days prior to the event

1389
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,440
so on october 14th

1390
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
um it was installed and it was actually

1391
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,200
installed when a halloween screen saver

1392
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,960
was was installed onto the system

1393
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,680
so if you remember back to amy even now

1394
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,319
you know

1395
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,160
don't go searching for free screensaver

1396
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,040
because you're probably going to be

1397
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,079
downloading malware

1398
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,440
or i guess if you want malware to

1399
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,800
analyze you'll go search for free

1400
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,480
screensavers

1401
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,560
in addition to new.net being installed

1402
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,520
there's another

1403
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,800
program called free offers from

1404
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,560
freeze.com installed so you know that

1405
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,160
sounds very legitimate

1406
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,520
um yeah so um

1407
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,560
they even found two that on october 19th

1408
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,079
when this happened somebody had actually

1409
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,839
searched for new hairstyles

1410
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,760
and and new.net would have intercepted

1411
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,680
this so that i think the theory is that

1412
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,319
um probably amero had searched for this

1413
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,920
uh during downtime or something like

1414
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,640
that

1415
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,079
um the new.net had intercepted it and

1416
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,680
then just started showing the porn

1417
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,440
pop-ups from there

1418
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
so what happened because of all this and

1419
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,200
let me say too i really recommend going

1420
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,240
and reading the opinion

1421
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,079
it's not too long it's like maybe 15 20

1422
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,359
pages with images

1423
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,160
um it's a very easy read it's really

1424
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,920
really good i'm really impressed by what

1425
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,119
they were able to do

1426
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,119
you know 16 years ago and there were

1427
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,880
some pretty um

1428
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,520
uh pr uh pretty well respected people

1429
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,359
who did this so one of the people

1430
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,200
uh his name is joe stewart he actually

1431
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,160
works for i think dell secure works now

1432
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,079
has been in security since the beginning

1433
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,680
doing all this um

1434
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,240
obviously alex eckleberry had was in

1435
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,280
charge of this

1436
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,040
i really recommend going in and reading

1437
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,839
this but what happened

1438
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:10,720
so because of this uh on june 6 2007 um

1439
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
let's just say judge uh but the judge

1440
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,920
threw out the conviction uh

1441
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,960
from uh against amero granted her a new

1442
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,800
trial and then in november of the next

1443
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,200
year

1444
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,760
the original charges were dropped so you

1445
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,680
know these four charges of

1446
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,440
basically contributing to a delinquency

1447
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,359
of a minor were were gone

1448
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,359
she was convicted of a misdemeanor

1449
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,720
disorderly conduct

1450
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,960
i'm not sure why i couldn't figure that

1451
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,480
out i haven't read the

1452
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,599
court transcripts uh yet uh in it's

1453
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,880
interesting in the opinion that was

1454
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,319
published on the forensic analysis they

1455
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,359
actually do say that

1456
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,839
amero was her worst owned witness she

1457
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:44,960
said a lot of things

1458
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,800
in on the stand that she probably

1459
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,160
shouldn't have said or you could

1460
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,359
remember something so

1461
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,359
um that probably came to it she paid a

1462
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,200
hundred dollars uh she did lose her

1463
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,920
teaching

1464
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,280
license but i'm guessing that she didn't

1465
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,960
want to teach after that anyways

1466
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,200
uh but great thing is not convicted

1467
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,040
so what can we learn from this case

1468
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,200
first off don't rely on one tool if you

1469
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,400
do get in

1470
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,040
in this to uh into forensics and you do

1471
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,720
need to do some type of analysis

1472
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,000
don't just rely on one tool there are

1473
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,200
lots of tools out there there are free

1474
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,040
tools there are commercial tools

1475
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,960
now even if you are standardized by you

1476
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,720
know using in case or ftk or one of the

1477
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,760
commercial tools

1478
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
every once in a while go and look at the

1479
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,280
results from another tool

1480
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,559
to see you know maybe your tool is

1481
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,720
missing something in case misses stuff

1482
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,000
ftk misses stuff the if you're analyzing

1483
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,720
things like the

1484
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,480
mft on a windows system they're going to

1485
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,760
miss something they don't show you

1486
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,480
everything

1487
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,520
um eric zimmerman's uh analyze

1488
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,760
mft tool uh is amazing for analyzing uh

1489
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,839
file systems um you know check out all

1490
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,880
these different tools

1491
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,720
and maybe they won't work in all cases

1492
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,920
but at least you'll have those that you

1493
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,040
can go in and check yourself

1494
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,800
second again look everywhere for

1495
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,559
evidence you know again this goes back

1496
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:56,960
to

1497
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,079
not relying on one tool but

1498
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,680
you know dig into everything you know

1499
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,319
don't just you know

1500
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,000
in this case the the detective only

1501
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,280
looked in the temporary internet files

1502
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,160
directory

1503
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,599
look in the history i mean that's i

1504
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,640
don't know why you would just start

1505
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,839
there i mean the history is always the

1506
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,200
first place that i look at

1507
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,119
so you definitely look everywhere for

1508
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,760
different types of evidence

1509
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,079
big thing verify what your what your

1510
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,920
results are and then verify them again

1511
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,359
don't just rely that on them on the

1512
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,440
first time you know a lot of times

1513
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,920
again this kind of comes back to tools

1514
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,880
your tools are going to tell you one

1515
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,280
thing

1516
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,760
make sure that's correct in forensics at

1517
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,200
least you know with what i do

1518
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,400
every case that we work has the

1519
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,640
potential to go to court i never want to

1520
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,160
go on a stand and find out that i

1521
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,800
screwed up

1522
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,400
because i did not verify some data and

1523
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,240
somebody else you know did double check

1524
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,520
my results and find out that i was wrong

1525
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,640
then finally our next assume nothing um

1526
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,920
there are a lot of assumptions in this

1527
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,319
case like malware can't show you

1528
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,079
pornographic pop-ups you know things

1529
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,599
like that you know don't assume that you

1530
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:55,920
may

1531
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
verify all your data and finally this

1532
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,559
kind of gets back to

1533
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,200
what randy stone said if you get in over

1534
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,480
your head ask for help

1535
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,119
you know there's no shame in that

1536
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:07,599
especially

1537
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,520
if you're doing something like this you

1538
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,119
want to be able to

1539
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,880
uh you know make sure that you're doing

1540
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,480
the right thing so so please ask for

1541
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,440
help

1542
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,160
all right so i know i've been going for

1543
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,920
about talking for about 45 minutes right

1544
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,400
now

1545
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,680
last case i'm gonna go through this

1546
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,040
pretty quickly actually get to the

1547
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,599
really cool parts

1548
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,000
so uh let me say too this case is one

1549
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,520
that i worked

1550
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,640
uh at a former employer not not anybody

1551
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,240
that i'm associated with right now

1552
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,000
again um this was uh i'll

1553
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,520
kind of say it was not done in a

1554
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,920
classified setting

1555
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,640
it's others from the team have actually

1556
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,720
talked about this case

1557
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,880
even before i did so i feel comfortable

1558
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,760
talking a little bit more about this

1559
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,960
so at this time

1560
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,880
the organization that i was working for

1561
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,000
was getting a lot of apt if you're not

1562
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,839
familiar with aptr they're advanced

1563
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,119
persistent threats they are usually

1564
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,880
state-sponsored attackers not always but

1565
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,000
in this case it was

1566
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,599
a state-sponsored attacker that was

1567
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,400
constantly compromising the organization

1568
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,960
and uh going through and um you know

1569
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,680
stealing

1570
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,599
information compromising other systems

1571
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,760
and so my team was actually created

1572
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,800
to help combat this uh my role on the

1573
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,119
team was as the reverse engineer this

1574
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,079
was one of my first

1575
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,880
i true ir jobs i was on the ir team

1576
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,920
everybody did ir

1577
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,040
forensics but we each had our own

1578
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,960
specializations mine was malware

1579
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
analysis and reverse engineering

1580
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,040
uh and so this particular apt thread

1581
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,480
actor they had a

1582
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,599
backdoor uh that they always used um

1583
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,599
this there were multiple versions they

1584
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:46,960
actually versioned their software we

1585
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,079
were able to determine that

1586
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,760
the interesting thing was they used

1587
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,839
various command and control protocols

1588
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,640
they used http they had a ftp version

1589
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,319
they had an ssl version

1590
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,640
to get into the bits and bytes uh if you

1591
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,160
dug into it in a disassembler it was

1592
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,880
written in c

1593
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,800
plus it was object oriented and so they

1594
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,319
could just literally

1595
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,079
you know add a new plug-in to change the

1596
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,400
c2 protocol very very quickly

1597
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,720
um and they also implemented some type

1598
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,720
of encryption around their c2 traffic so

1599
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,000
it wasn't just like you know we could

1600
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,520
you know sniff the traffic and see what

1601
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,280
they were doing it what unfortunately it

1602
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,160
was not that easy

1603
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,280
so i i had a copy of this back door

1604
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,680
i and i was my job was to reverse

1605
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,280
engineering so i had a couple goals and

1606
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,240
this is something that i always

1607
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,760
recommend if you've ever taken

1608
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,599
any of my malware analysis courses

1609
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,119
actually any of my courses

1610
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,480
i always say you know when you go into

1611
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,680
an investigation when you're doing

1612
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,800
malware analysis when you're doing

1613
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,520
forensics

1614
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,440
have goals in mind because if you don't

1615
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,400
you're just going to be bouncing all

1616
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,119
over the place

1617
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,800
you rarely have time to do everything

1618
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,880
that you want and so you want to focus

1619
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,319
and you know meet those goals and if you

1620
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:47,599
have more time then you go on to the

1621
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,599
next goals but my goals were let's see

1622
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,800
if we can break the encryption

1623
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,160
you know it was doing this encryption

1624
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,000
over the network i wanted to see if we

1625
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,200
could get into that i wanted to see if

1626
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,480
we could break that

1627
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,800
um second you know determine what the

1628
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,240
commands were within it

1629
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,880
um this was a back door uh and so the

1630
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,280
the

1631
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,200
attacker was obviously obviously sending

1632
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,200
some type of commands to and from it

1633
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,400
and so i wanted to know um you know what

1634
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,920
those commands were because that's going

1635
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,440
to help us determine what the the

1636
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,800
attacker's capabilities

1637
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,160
are um not really a goal

1638
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,920
but the good news is

1639
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,160
i had resources available to me that had

1640
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,280
already accomplished some

1641
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,480
of this we uh we had instrumented our

1642
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,440
network

1643
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,079
uh i will give my boss at the time uh

1644
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,680
credit for this he had instrumented our

1645
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,839
network and this was a global network

1646
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,000
uh he had instrumented it with uh

1647
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,880
network uh

1648
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,119
full pcap capture which at this point in

1649
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,880
time was pretty rare to have

1650
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,440
um just uh globally so so we had the

1651
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,720
ability to get on

1652
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,640
on these systems we had created these

1653
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,160
sensors so we could actually deploy our

1654
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,040
own code to them

1655
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,319
we could do things very very quickly

1656
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,280
additionally there was actually probably

1657
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,800
still is

1658
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,839
um a lot of our competitors their

1659
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,359
security teams and us we had gotten

1660
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,880
together and formed a group because we

1661
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,760
were all getting hit by this

1662
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,119
organization and so we were sharing

1663
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:07,760
information

1664
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,440
this was like one of the first kind of

1665
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,200
unofficial fusion centers

1666
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,800
where you know all these like really

1667
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,720
really smart people were coming together

1668
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,839
and they were sharing this information

1669
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:16,960
so i actually had

1670
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,800
people i could bounce things off of um

1671
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,920
to my knowledge or what i'm about to

1672
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,520
talk about nobody else had figured out

1673
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,040
or if they had they didn't talk about it

1674
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,240
excuse me sorry about that so um

1675
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,720
because i work for trusted sec i am

1676
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,640
contractually obligated to include memes

1677
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,400
in uh presentation

1678
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,280
um so uh from here on out we're going to

1679
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,960
be getting into some technical stuff

1680
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,880
i will do my best to summarize it as

1681
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,720
best i can too because i know nobody

1682
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,280
wants to stay

1683
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,440
or most people don't want to stare at

1684
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,400
ida pro

1685
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,520
but here we go so

1686
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,440
as i reverse engineered this uh the

1687
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,000
encryption on this uh back door

1688
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,160
i found out that it actually used xor to

1689
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,280
encrypt the data

1690
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,960
now when you if you're not familiar with

1691
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,040
xor it's a mathematical operation

1692
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,040
that you take one value you xor it to

1693
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,040
another value and you get a third value

1694
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,440
out it's used a lot in encryption you

1695
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,200
should not use it for encryption

1696
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
at least solely for encryption because

1697
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,359
um let's say you have value a

1698
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,160
you export by a key and get value b in

1699
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,680
order to get that value back all you

1700
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,960
have to do is export the

1701
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,040
the encoded value by by the key or by

1702
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,480
the original value and you get that that

1703
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,520
third value

1704
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,839
um so it's not really the most secure

1705
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:26,960
it's not really encryption

1706
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,319
it's more obfuscation but the initial

1707
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:30,720
key

1708
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,319
that the um the attacker uh created

1709
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,319
um they would go through this loop here

1710
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,440
they would basically go through a loop

1711
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,400
15 times

1712
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,160
they would increase the loop value by a

1713
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,599
certain amount they would mod it by a

1714
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,720
value and then they would place that

1715
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,240
value into a

1716
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,960
byte array so you would end up with a 16

1717
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,440
byte

1718
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,559
xor key the key thing to remember here

1719
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,720
is that the initial key at least in the

1720
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,000
first pass

1721
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,400
is always the same key it's a static

1722
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,480
value every single time 100

1723
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,920
you're always going to get this key i

1724
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,000
looked at different versions of the back

1725
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,559
door

1726
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,319
they did not change it you always get

1727
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,839
this key

1728
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,160
so that was the initial key generation

1729
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,160
they actually went through a second time

1730
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,160
to modify that key and the way that they

1731
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,319
did that is they would take this

1732
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,040
static value uh over here again looked

1733
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,720
at different versions that static value

1734
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,920
did not change

1735
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,760
uh they would loop through the key the

1736
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,680
original key uh though the one that we

1737
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,160
have

1738
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,040
here they would look through loop

1739
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,000
through it and xor

1740
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,760
the bytes of the static value against

1741
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,319
the key

1742
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,760
yeah and so what would happen is you

1743
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,880
would end up with

1744
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,920
this key again we're still getting a

1745
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,040
static key

1746
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,040
across all the different versions after

1747
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,720
the initial key generation

1748
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,880
you still get this key now it would have

1749
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,559
been very simple for them to modify this

1750
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,000
all they had to do is modify this you

1751
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,960
know salt value

1752
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,240
and you'd get something different but

1753
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,720
they didn't um so

1754
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,200
we have our initial key around the

1755
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,079
encryption itself

1756
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,160
like i said all the data that was sent

1757
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,160
uh in every packet and they actually

1758
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,680
encrypted each packet

1759
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,880
that was sent out the data in each

1760
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,280
packet um it was encrypted using the 16

1761
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,400
byte xor key

1762
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,880
now two things remember the data was a

1763
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,559
variable length it wasn't like there was

1764
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,079
like the static buffer that they would

1765
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,280
send that was always

1766
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,280
you know 16 bytes or 256 bytes or

1767
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,480
something like that it was this variable

1768
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,200
length

1769
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,960
um the second is that they would

1770
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,240
actually create two

1771
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,480
random numbers to obfuscate the data

1772
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,000
length and modify the xor

1773
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,160
key the reason they did this is is

1774
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,200
that's how they introduced some

1775
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,480
randomness to this they would create

1776
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,839
these two random values

1777
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,280
and then they would take that and take

1778
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,119
those random values and modify

1779
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,720
this uh the static xor key

1780
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,839
and the length of the data that's how

1781
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,440
they they did it right there

1782
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,040
obviously getting the length uh it

1783
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,720
doesn't really matter um

1784
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,319
this is how they would go through and

1785
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,640
modify the xor key that static x4 key

1786
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,160
with the random number that they they

1787
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,000
generated

1788
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,680
they would basically just take take that

1789
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,599
second random number they would copy

1790
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,040
the first two bytes of the xor key uh a

1791
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,520
they would do this like loop over it and

1792
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,799
then they would copy those first two

1793
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,200
bytes back into the key

1794
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
what of what i just said is a huge

1795
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,598
mistake

1796
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,119
they only did this to the first two

1797
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,880
bytes of the xor key

1798
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,400
the rest of the xor key was still static

1799
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,319
i believe that this was a programming

1800
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,160
error on their part

1801
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,599
um and this right here because they

1802
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,680
screwed up in this way

1803
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,680
led to i probably still could have

1804
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,119
broken it and if they did it to the

1805
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,400
whole thing but

1806
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,920
this led to us being able to detect them

1807
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,359
at any point in time on our network and

1808
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,960
i'll explain how

1809
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,040
so yeah i went through all that what

1810
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,160
does that all mean

1811
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,920
if you just kind of glossed over by

1812
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,079
looking at all those ida pro

1813
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,720
shots what it comes down to is the

1814
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,040
backdoor creates a 16 byte

1815
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,520
encryption key the initial value is a

1816
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,240
static value

1817
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,480
they only modified the first two bytes

1818
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,319
of the encryption key with a

1819
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,280
uh with a random value so because we

1820
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,400
know what the static

1821
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,720
key is except for the first two bytes

1822
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,160
then in theory we

1823
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,000
even if i couldn't figure out anything

1824
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,520
more i could take that the rest of that

1825
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,400
static value

1826
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,240
and i could you know decrypt their their

1827
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,160
traffic

1828
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,559
um and then finally it would ups

1829
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,079
obfuscate the length of the data with a

1830
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,480
random value

1831
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,559
so this is what the encrypted packet

1832
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,119
looked like in each one that was sent

1833
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,559
the first two bytes would be the random

1834
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,000
number that was used to modify the

1835
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,400
length

1836
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,160
that random number was modified a little

1837
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,760
bit although again it was a static value

1838
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,040
that they modified it by so it's very

1839
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,079
easy to get back

1840
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,440
then the next two bytes would be the

1841
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,599
obfuscated length so because

1842
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,000
we know what the random number is we can

1843
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,280
take that and we can

1844
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,359
figure out what the length of the data

1845
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,799
is supposed to be

1846
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,119
the next four bytes the next two bytes

1847
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,960
were the random number that modified the

1848
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,000
xor key

1849
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,520
again this was modified a little bit but

1850
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,359
we could figure out why it was done in a

1851
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,040
static way so we could figure that out

1852
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,079
and then byte6 through whatever

1853
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,880
that was all the obfuscated data um

1854
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,079
bytes eight through nine

1855
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,480
over the command it was like a number

1856
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,359
value that

1857
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:15,280
equaled something so again because

1858
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,280
we know all this information uh we can

1859
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,640
decrypt this entire packet because

1860
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,240
only the first two bytes of this key are

1861
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,160
modified those are the only ones that we

1862
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,079
don't know however

1863
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,680
they send the random number that was

1864
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,599
used to modify those bytes in the packet

1865
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,119
so we can then take that and you

1866
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,880
figure out what it's supposed to be so

1867
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,359
we can decrypt everything in this packet

1868
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,839
um this again is hard to see i apologize

1869
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:44,079
um uh apparently this happened in 2010

1870
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,040
so

1871
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,960
eleven years ago is when this happened

1872
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,119
um this is uh

1873
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,359
a decoding program that i wrote i worked

1874
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,480
with somebody on my team

1875
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,319
we made it in real time so we could

1876
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:55,760
actually throw this on one of our

1877
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,839
sensors run it and in real time it would

1878
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:58,960
detect the

1879
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,640
uh the backdoor traffic and it would

1880
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,880
decode it a couple things to

1881
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,720
kind of show here uh we were able to

1882
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,079
figure out all the commands it had a

1883
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,200
heartbeat commands

1884
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,359
um it had a shell command and then you

1885
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,200
know once you type shell it would give

1886
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,319
you back a shell

1887
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,319
and then the the attacker could you type

1888
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:15,440
in the commands and we could see

1889
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,720
everything in real time

1890
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,640
and this is very very key to what i'm

1891
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,480
about to talk to next

1892
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,920
um additionally the heartbeat command uh

1893
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,599
was all zeros

1894
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,559
um the great thing is your zero xored by

1895
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,359
any number

1896
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,400
is that number so if you xor zero

1897
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,599
with ten the resulting value is ten

1898
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,520
so because of that because of where the

1899
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,880
command was in the packet

1900
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,040
that is a static value it was not

1901
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,960
modified so we could then write a

1902
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,680
snort signature at the time to detect

1903
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,079
this

1904
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,119
so we were actually able to determine uh

1905
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,119
you know write a signature to find any

1906
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,400
compromise system on

1907
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,920
our in our organization using snorts um

1908
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,839
the one part i didn't leave out here ups

1909
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,119
that was what we called the

1910
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,039
apt group so uh you can probably go and

1911
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,799
look it up who ups is

1912
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,359
yeah ups is i think they're apt one or

1913
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,720
or somebody so

1914
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,760
um but yeah uh

1915
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,160
but in other words we if they were on

1916
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,599
our network we would be able to detect

1917
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,119
it because we had visibility across the

1918
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:15,920
entire uh

1919
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,079
global organization and we could decrypt

1920
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,520
their traffic in real time

1921
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,440
so so what happened who cares you know

1922
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,280
great tyler you're able to do this

1923
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,799
so this is the cool part of the story

1924
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,160
and this is the part of the story that i

1925
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:26,960
love

1926
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,200
so one night our heartbeat alert went

1927
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,359
off the apt was in the network we had

1928
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:32,079
these alerts

1929
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,119
so that you know if we uh the the search

1930
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,559
that i was on was very small i think we

1931
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,480
were like four or five people we had

1932
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,640
when these alerts went off it was all

1933
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,160
hands on deck doesn't matter where you

1934
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,599
are doesn't matter what time

1935
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,079
um i actually had uh these alerts sent

1936
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,000
to my phone at a blackberry at the time

1937
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,400
it would be sent to my phone uh through

1938
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,359
email and when

1939
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,039
the uh or through a text and when the

1940
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,359
phone saw that um you guys remember

1941
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,680
janine in ghostbusters where she screams

1942
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,880
out we got one

1943
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,880
yeah that's what it would go off which

1944
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,000
sounded great at the time

1945
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,559
until it's 3 a.m and it goes off for the

1946
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:05,520
fifth time

1947
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,559
and my wife is just not happy um but you

1948
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,520
know this goes off

1949
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,039
in fact i think this happened of course

1950
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,400
it happened on a friday night it was

1951
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,319
like at seven or eight o'clock at night

1952
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,400
so it wasn't too bad but the alert went

1953
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,079
off the apt was in our network everybody

1954
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,039
kind of jumped on

1955
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,319
so what we did was using this real-time

1956
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,039
encoding

1957
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,640
we were actually able to watch the

1958
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,000
attacker in real time this is the first

1959
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,400
time we were able to do this

1960
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,319
we were able to see them connect to each

1961
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,440
system that they were connecting

1962
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,920
to so uh we had this visibility we had

1963
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,559
the the

1964
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,400
decoder going we were actually watching

1965
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,760
them type their commands of you know

1966
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,599
connecting from one system to the other

1967
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,599
so what we did was when they would

1968
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,520
connect to one system

1969
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,079
we take that system down as they would

1970
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,680
try to go to another system

1971
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,240
we would take that system down so one by

1972
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,000
one as the attackers are going to these

1973
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,559
systems

1974
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,160
some of which we did not know they had

1975
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,640
access to we would immediately take that

1976
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,680
system down

1977
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,720
and as the uh as this happened soon the

1978
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,400
attacker had no systems left

1979
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,559
you could actually see them tight as

1980
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,240
they were typing these commands

1981
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,000
trying to figure out why the system they

1982
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,359
had literally connected to

1983
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,280
three seconds before was no longer

1984
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,640
responding they were starting to panic

1985
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,359
you could see that

1986
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,640
they're making more mistakes in their

1987
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,559
typing and all this it was so cool to

1988
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,119
see

1989
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,559
but with this we were actually able to

1990
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,400
find everywhere the attacker had we

1991
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,839
kicked them out and

1992
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,760
to my knowledge we never saw them come

1993
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,000
back and this is a group that had been

1994
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,920
plaguing us for years

1995
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,200
now did they never come back i can't

1996
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:33,760
tell you

1997
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,720
um the the kind of downside of this is

1998
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,559
we kind of revealed our hand that we

1999
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:40,000
knew what they were doing we could see

2000
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,200
what they were doing so they may have

2001
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,359
switched to an entirely new back door

2002
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,960
i even obviously eventually left that

2003
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,119
organization to my knowledge though they

2004
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,400
never saw them again

2005
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,039
so if we did actually scare them enough

2006
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,319
to kick them out it worked

2007
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:56,000
so that was so cool so what can we learn

2008
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,680
from this and i know i'm over time so i

2009
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,480
apologize

2010
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,760
um first off don't roll your own first

2011
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,039
off don't roll your own encryption

2012
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,119
obviously this is a kind of standard

2013
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,079
thing the

2014
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,000
adversary went and did this they they

2015
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,599
tried to be smart they tried to you know

2016
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,440
do all these loops to modify their xor

2017
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:11,839
key

2018
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,680
and they failed horribly they would if

2019
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,280
they would have used something like rc4

2020
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,119
or you know something else like that

2021
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,640
chances are we would not have been able

2022
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,599
to figure to break their encryption

2023
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,400
reversionary reverse engineering is

2024
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,599
powerful

2025
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,119
if you don't have somebody on your staff

2026
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,319
that can do reverse engineering or

2027
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,480
malware analysis

2028
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,559
fear find somebody who can it is super

2029
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,400
powerful you don't want to be uploading

2030
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,000
malware to virustotal you don't

2031
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,400
want to be uh necessarily sending it to

2032
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,839
your antivirus company

2033
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,000
uh because once you do that again you

2034
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,200
you kind of reveal your hand to the

2035
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,799
attacker or you reveal to the

2036
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,280
world that you have been attacked you

2037
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,039
have somebody on staff who can do this

2038
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,280
or or work with somebody who can they

2039
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,640
can get you a lot of the information

2040
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,079
that you need very very quickly

2041
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,920
or at least if nothing else you know

2042
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,599
work with some of these uh

2043
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,440
online sites like um joe sandbox and

2044
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,880
any dot run uh who can you can purchase

2045
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,400
a private sandbox so

2046
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,920
what you upload is not shared with

2047
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,240
anybody

2048
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,559
visibility and instrumentation is key

2049
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:13,920
you know the reason we were able to do

2050
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,839
this is because my boss had worked very

2051
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:16,640
very hard

2052
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,039
to get network sensors deployed on most

2053
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,400
networks around the world

2054
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,000
at least all the major networks in this

2055
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,079
organization if we had not had that

2056
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:24,880
visibility

2057
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,640
we would have probably seen the attacker

2058
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,160
go to a certain location and then we

2059
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,359
would have lost sight to them

2060
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:30,960
a lot of organizations i see when they

2061
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,359
put up ids or something like that

2062
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,839
it is only on their internet connection

2063
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,119
there is a lot of stuff going on your

2064
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,160
internal network

2065
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,280
you need to be you need to have

2066
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,520
visibility into that uh if it's

2067
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,039
even if it's just something like netflow

2068
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,559
you don't need to deploy like

2069
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,039
dark trace or you know a full ids even

2070
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,480
if you have something like netflow

2071
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,319
going on your network on your internal

2072
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:53,280
network that can be extremely powerful

2073
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,520
uh and then finally one person is not an

2074
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,559
ir team

2075
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,799
i i played a key role in this but so did

2076
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,640
all the other people that i worked with

2077
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,640
uh we had that we had the person uh

2078
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,079
obviously my boss who i mentioned who

2079
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:04,480
depo

2080
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,400
who got all the network sensors deployed

2081
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,000
we had a network engineer who worked

2082
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,839
tirelessly to get those working at top

2083
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,799
speed we had uh the the person who

2084
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,839
had written the kind of the shell

2085
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,599
for my script so that i could literally

2086
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,039
just write the decoding part

2087
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,640
plug it into his and it automatically

2088
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,079
became real time

2089
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,280
so you know an ir team is a

2090
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,960
team you need to work with multiple

2091
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,000
people everybody's going to have the

2092
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,440
role and as you work together

2093
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,760
like in this case you can do some pretty

2094
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,400
freaking awesome things

2095
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,720
so i have been talking for over an hour
