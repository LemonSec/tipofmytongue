1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,879
because that's always fun to start off

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,840
with just a q a

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,359
it's because it's the trusted second

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,080
logo and trusted set green

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
right i'm a principal security

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,599
consultant at trust attack

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,759
is probably why he's leading me into

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,960
disclosing that

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,840
um but yeah i've known rocky for uh

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,880
quite some time

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,720
um i was trying to figure it out the

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,080
other day and i

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,519
think it's been 2008 and i'm really bad

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,039
at math so you guys can

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,159
can do that but yeah so rocky i

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,360
actually wouldn't be here today if it

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,760
wasn't for rocky um

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,000
and i actually owe him a lot i refer to

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
him as my business daddy

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,719
uh because when i first started i was

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,280
doing

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
network engineering i didn't know

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
anything about infosec

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
uh i i was a little bit of an [ __ ]

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,000
teenager

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,360
uh i mean yeah so

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
i yes i i would take

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
uh this was back you know when all of

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
the hashes were just lm hashes so

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,320
we would crack the password and we'd

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
crack like half of it

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
and then we'd crack the other half of it

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
because it was obvious what the password

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,320
was

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,880
so he kept our administrator at our high

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,479
school would just come up these

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,799
ridiculously complicated passwords to

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,240
which we would take a couple days to

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,560
crack

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
and then write it on post-it note not do

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
anything wrong with it we would just

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,759
leave it on a post-it note on his desk

43
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,400
or on his

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
door so that he knew that it was broken

45
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,439
so that was that was my

46
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,240
uh like how i got into to hacking but

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,840
that was really rocky that

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,799
it brought me over uh to the pen testing

49
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,200
uh

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,320
and introduced me to the conference

51
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
scene as well um

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
see gerbicon started in 2012 right

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
so i think derbycon 2 was the first

54
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,880
conference that i went to rocky was like

55
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,159
hey

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,759
why don't you come down to kentucky with

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,520
me and then check this thing out

58
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,479
so that that was uh when i met dave too

59
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
because he did the the training actually

60
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,040
uh adrian was one of the instructors too

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,479
uh during that uh

62
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,680
that training so come a long way

63
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,360
um but yeah so uh i got a story about

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
this one time he's doing a physical uh i

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
don't know if you know uh paul koblitz

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
but i was with him and

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
and so we were in this high-rise

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,280
building

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
and he went one way to take one route

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
and i went another and

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
it was like the 21st floor or something

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,520
like that so i went up to the 22nd floor

73
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
right and i go down the fire escape

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,440
and luckily it didn't lock behind me but

75
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,239
i get there

76
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
and i'm trying to figure out how to open

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
up the emergency exit from the opposite

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,519
side and i

79
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,920
i think that i i got a pretty good uh

80
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
idea and um

81
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
but i just wanna run past paul so i run

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,599
back down and i grab paul and bring him

83
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,280
back up there so the both of us are now

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
in this fire escape

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,920
this is a you know a stairway shaft of

86
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,239
you know 30 stories at least so it's

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,440
just echoey

88
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,480
and then all of a sudden we hear a door

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,840
hello anybody there

90
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,640
so one lesson that i learned that day is

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
when you have the adrenaline really

92
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
pumping

93
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
in your brain you know even there was no

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,120
threat of going to jail

95
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
or you know this was all sanctioned

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
stuff but you still get that adrenaline

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
i i learned fight or flight if you start

98
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
eating

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,120
it takes away that adrenaline so if you

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,799
ever you know running from

101
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
somebody i'm not just saying yes it's a

102
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,720
it's a

103
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,879
like a biohack so yeah i learned that

104
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,760
from covalent

105
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
but anyway so we're sitting there we

106
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,360
hear these you know

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
you just eat all the time no he but he

108
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
when he's doing stuff he carries

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,760
he taught me to carry granola bar for

110
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
real i do when on physical pen tests i

111
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
carry a granola bar

112
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,599
because your heart gets pumping when you

113
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,879
know you're picking a lock and all of a

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,319
sudden it opens in front of you

115
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
and this happened to public said i

116
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
actually less than six months ago

117
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
um and the the guy goes can i help you

118
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,400
we said yeah uh it said telephone room

119
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,319
we were looking for the

120
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,120
telephone oh no that's over here and so

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,760
he led

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,439
me back escorted me behind the counter

123
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,640
back to the telephone that was one of

124
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,959
the goals anyway different story

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,320
so we're in this elevator shaft

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,639
and

127
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,840
i'm shaking like

128
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
just he's like all right you know eat

129
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,280
something um

130
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,240
but anyway so so the the door closes and

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
we go

132
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
we immediately like run up to hide in

133
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,080
the bathroom we're like what just

134
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,280
happened you know and that's what he

135
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
gave me the food and stuff

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
and then you know some time went by and

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
we finished up our assessment and i was

138
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
sitting down in the lobby just kind of

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,759
waiting for paul

140
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
and the security guard comes up to me

141
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
and he goes hey

142
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,639
uh were you up on the 23rd floor

143
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,280
yeah what were you doing up there i said

144
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,919
well i

145
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,800
i was talking to my wife i i took a

146
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
private phone call in the

147
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,120
fire escape and he was oh okay i figured

148
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
it was something like that

149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
you know they reported that a guy with a

150
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,400
beard and really nice pants

151
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,680
was in the fire escape and so i saw you

152
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,199
i thought that was you i was like yep

153
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,560
that was me good detective work

154
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,120
and uh yeah so uh trying to think oh

155
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,039
that was also the time where

156
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,759
uh we since we went the separate ways

157
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,039
paul had gotten busted

158
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,479
right away like he tried to tell the

159
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,080
front desk lady something and she didn't

160
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
believe him so

161
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
he was just sitting there busted so then

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,479
i come up the elevator

163
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,199
i see him he looks at me i didn't see

164
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,520
the text message that said like

165
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,199
go to the other floor because he was

166
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,039
already busted that was fun

167
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,960
all right let's see what other stories

168
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,080
are

169
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
on the elevator oh i got back on the

170
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
elevator yeah

171
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
and then went right back in because i

172
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,479
saw him he was like

173
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,600
uh let's see uh

174
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
i got stories but there's some stories

175
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
that

176
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,680
they're so no they're so specific that

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
you can't

178
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,919
the the laptop from hell

179
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,759
all right so i i'm still

180
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,520
so i had to write a report the other day

181
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,280
for a client and it had zero findings

182
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
and it was the most frustrating time

183
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,360
that i had ever had because by design

184
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
they gave me the password i could log

185
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
into the account

186
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,199
as long as i was physically on that

187
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,280
premise if i

188
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,800
took it to my house which i did

189
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
i it as soon as you logged in i logged

190
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
you up i couldn't stop it

191
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
everything's encrypted it's all a tpm it

192
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
was a brick there was nothing i could do

193
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,520
to it so

194
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
i sent them a slow clap gif and uh

195
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,840
that was that was their report so do you

196
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,400
know what i'm talking about

197
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,840
so we'll talk about it later uh let's

198
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,160
see

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,599
the audience what was the name of the

200
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,520
one song oh

201
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,759
i believe it was absolute i is the

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,240
software i i hadn't heard it a time i

203
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
did i damned to try and sir they even

204
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,479
told me

205
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,479
like what it was triggering on and i

206
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,240
still could not trick it because it was

207
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
just so much different metadata i was

208
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,440
pulling in

209
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,319
that yeah so i it was frustrating i gave

210
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,400
up on that yeah so check out absolute

211
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
um also it does uh like

212
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
proximity alerts so as soon as that

213
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
device showed up at my network as soon

214
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,240
as i plugged it in

215
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,599
they got an email they knew when i

216
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,240
started working on it so that was fun

217
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,599
but uh let's see uh physical

218
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,879
stories are usually the best um

219
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
so i was in boston in a high rise and we

220
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,280
walk up and there is this

221
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,319
turnstiles you know so one one person in

222
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,400
uh through the the gated time and i was

223
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
like oh

224
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,000
we're done guys like there's a security

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
guard right there you know

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
we can't make it into the elevator bank

227
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
so the guy i'm with is like here

228
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
hold my beard and just walks just walks

229
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,199
right behind the guy

230
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,800
and as soon as the gate opens he just

231
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
sticks his hand in and holds it

232
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,360
no arm goes off nobody looks at him

233
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,039
security guards don't care he just kept

234
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,360
walking i said okay

235
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,520
i did the exact same thing right after

236
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,879
he did we got in

237
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,080
uh that was uh um so we were talking

238
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,639
earlier

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,640
uh about uh like pretexts and some

240
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,559
pretexts are off limits like uh uh

241
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
being a law enforcement agent like

242
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,719
impersonating a law enforcement agent

243
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,120
uh so i i don't do that and i don't

244
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,959
advocate for that i also don't advocate

245
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,560
to say that you're the fire marshal

246
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
however a a good ruse uh is

247
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,200
do a fire safety inspection and check

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,080
all of the expiration dates on all the

249
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
fire extinguishers which gets you

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,320
into a lot of buildings in a lot of

251
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
rooms and

252
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
yeah that and carry a ladder you can go

253
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
anywhere anybody

254
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,880
any questions all right i think i'm out

255
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,399
of stories
