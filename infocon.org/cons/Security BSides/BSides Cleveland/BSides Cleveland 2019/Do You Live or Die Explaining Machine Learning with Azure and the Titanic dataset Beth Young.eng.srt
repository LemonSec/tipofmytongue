1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
up in the computer and you get output

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,250
for a machine learning you've got data

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,139
you have your output which in most cases

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,960
just means you have some labeled data

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,629
you put it all in and you get a program

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,119
or in our case an algorithm that comes

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:23,160
out of it so there's two types

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:27,119
supervised and unsupervised supervised

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,330
learning is you have training data it's

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,430
labeled you know what the outcome is as

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,579
you're teaching the computer what you

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,590
want you can think of this really as

13
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:41,460
classifications or buckets of data so

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:44,070
you you know got a giant ball pit you

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,690
pick a ball up this is red and it goes

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,910
in the red bucket you pick another one

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,680
it's blue it goes in the blue bucket so

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,690
things go in very predictable places for

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,570
regression classifications these are

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,430
your continuous variables so time money

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,859
that type of thing those are your

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,019
continuous or your regression

23
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:06,960
classifications for unsupervised

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,020
learning the desired output isn't known

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,740
so your clustering so if you think of

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,110
like user agent strings you kind of

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,860
concussed Erb these are all of my

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,369
Mozilla these are all of my Firefox or

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,140
Chrome or whatever it is so you can

30
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:31,039
cluster your based on specific

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:34,049
characteristics of the data um here spam

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,540
starts supervised learning and then when

33
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,670
you put it in production it still is

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,229
learning and that's based on buckets so

35
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,729
you can think of your unsupervised

36
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,340
learning do you guys remember this in

37
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,530
wall-e he's got a spork he's like well

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,420
it kind of looks like a spoon but it

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,640
kind of looks like a fork and he's just

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,640
I don't not sure which bucket it goes

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,430
into that's your unsupervised learning

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,930
he's trying to figure out which one

43
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,960
close more closely matches so for

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,890
security applications there are security

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,680
applications out there already your spam

46
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,670
detection is one of them I mentioned

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,530
all righty anomaly detection you're

48
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,700
looking at your network traffic what

49
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,689
doesn't fit in the normal pattern

50
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,798
unsupervised again you got your

51
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:30,409
clustering this is slowly building I

52
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:35,090
mean we've been using machine learning

53
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:37,189
for spam techniques for almost twenty

54
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,069
years now so machine learning is in the

55
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:46,010
security field isn't new it's just

56
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:48,290
become the newest buzzword so if there

57
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,260
are applications for security data out

58
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:54,950
there why am I not using security data

59
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,510
why did I pick the Titanic because it

60
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,668
really is easier for people to

61
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,370
understand I'm gonna live or I'm gonna

62
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:04,400
die if you look at some of the data

63
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:08,060
that's out there I know this is kind of

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,709
small but we just have a URL and whether

65
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,560
it's good or bad there's no real

66
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:15,500
features to it we don't know why they

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,959
labeled it good or bad or you get things

68
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,870
like this which has 22 different

69
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,290
features but it's things like an AAS

70
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,930
number or their their page ranking it's

71
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,209
not again really helping us understand

72
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:33,019
why something is good or bad

73
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,959
so using showing you this with security

74
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,909
data was a little harder to do so I pick

75
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,010
something easier to help explain the

76
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:45,198
concepts because you guys understand

77
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:47,298
this data age sex name passenger class

78
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:52,069
it's easier to understand and get the

79
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:55,009
basics down so a moment of silence here

80
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:57,679
we are gonna try the live demo we've got

81
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:59,869
to pray to the demo gods and I really do

82
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,410
have to put my glasses on so I can see

83
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,510
[Music]

84
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:10,050
so we are going to the Azure machine

85
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:14,480
learning studio and to get this started

86
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:21,420
we just click for a new blank experiment

87
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:31,130
so our blank experiment gives us just a

88
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:31,130
canvas to work on all right a moment

89
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,349
[Music]

90
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:52,779
see I obviously didn't make the

91
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:57,520
sacrifice yes all right

92
00:04:52,779 --> 00:05:01,389
so we now we got it I think all right

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,659
and that is hard to see so we're gonna

94
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:10,389
make it bigger

95
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:16,029
yes turn off the light - all right you

96
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:17,349
guys see it all right now I'm in the

97
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,939
dark and you can't see me so this is

98
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:22,029
awesome

99
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:26,439
okay so I've already loaded up my data

100
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:29,080
set you can find data sets to play with

101
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,229
there's a website called Kegel and I'll

102
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,139
have that link at the end so I've loaded

103
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:37,240
my Titanic training set so I'm just

104
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:40,680
gonna drag it over here and it gets

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,599
dropped I've already loaded my data now

106
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,689
next thing that I'm gonna do is you need

107
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,870
to explore your data the speaker this

108
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:50,979
morning Frank when he was talking about

109
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,439
you know machine learning is not a

110
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:56,199
silver bullet this is why you have to

111
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,360
understand your data if you don't

112
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,990
understand your data you can't train

113
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,210
anything so you have to know where am I

114
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,979
missing data what does it look like so

115
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,839
the first thing we're gonna do here is

116
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:10,839
we're gonna look at our data we need to

117
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:14,529
visualize our data to understand what we

118
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:17,129
have I was afraid of this this is gonna

119
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:17,129
be slow

120
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:24,069
okay so on our Titanic data and I can't

121
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,589
move that window

122
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,299
the first thing field we have as we are

123
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:31,479
looking at this the other thing that we

124
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:33,669
need to do is decide what data is going

125
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,179
to be important for us to make our

126
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:39,579
predictions so if we look at passenger

127
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:42,429
ID if you click on the field it gives

128
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:47,129
you statistics about your data so you'll

129
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:51,568
see here that all of our data we have

130
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:54,429
891 rows and 12 columns so if we have

131
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,399
891 unique values what does that tell us

132
00:06:54,429 --> 00:07:00,039
it's just an identifier it's not gonna

133
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,139
help us classify anything so passenger

134
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,748
ID it's not going to be important for us

135
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:07,869
when we're looking at our data our

136
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:10,719
survived you'll notice that we have two

137
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:13,479
unique values we have a 0 and a 1 this

138
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:15,998
is our label we're gonna need this

139
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,029
column because this is going to tell us

140
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:22,569
whether that person lived or died so 0

141
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:26,349
they died 1 they lived so we're gonna

142
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:29,919
need this one p class you'll notice that

143
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:32,498
we have three values of 1 and a well

144
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,529
minimum is 1 max is 3 so there's

145
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:37,869
probably a 2 in there because we have 3

146
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:40,089
unique values these are what's the

147
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:42,389
passenger class are they first class

148
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:44,860
second class or third class passengers

149
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,229
this is probably important if you guys

150
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,629
remember your Titanic in history lessons

151
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,899
first class passengers were more likely

152
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:54,279
to get off the boat remember so this is

153
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,589
a field that we're going to want to know

154
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,839
later and you'll notice that there's no

155
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:04,239
missing values which is good because we

156
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:06,849
don't want missing values name we don't

157
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:11,888
have any missing values but they're all

158
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:14,829
unique but does name matter all the best

159
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:18,639
survives and all the Ben dies is that

160
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:21,610
the way it works no this one probably

161
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,049
doesn't matter whether what their name

162
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:28,959
is so we're not going to use that one

163
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:29,649
we're gonna go on across here sex male

164
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,020
or female

165
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:33,700
again no missing values

166
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,120
this is probably important because we

167
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:41,550
know more women got off than men

168
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:44,290
what about age think it's important yeah

169
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,170
age is going to be important but notice

170
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,050
down here we have a hundred and seventy

171
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,390
seven missing values what does that mean

172
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,609
we've got to do something about those

173
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,050
missing values so we're going to talk

174
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,600
about this a little bit more when we

175
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,140
clean our data but just remember we have

176
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,830
missing values in the age column so

177
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:08,530
sibling and spouse and PR chiz parent

178
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,000
and child so if they're traveling with

179
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:14,650
somebody do you think they're more or

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,840
less likely to get off well I don't know

181
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:21,340
so we're gonna include those and see

182
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:24,640
what we come up with ticket is just a

183
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,500
ticket number oh it we only have six

184
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,300
hundred and eighty-one unique values

185
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,730
which means there's some duplications in

186
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,180
there but that's still a lot and it's

187
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,550
probably not going to tell us much fare

188
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:41,500
may tell us something

189
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:44,680
but if we use fair this is also related

190
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,420
to the class of the passenger because

191
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,500
first-class tickets cost more than

192
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,469
third-class tickets

193
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,690
we're going to include it but just know

194
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,830
that we could be skewing our data a

195
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,110
little bit and then the last two are the

196
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,770
cabin numbers and where they embarked

197
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:05,970
where did they get on the ship does it

198
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,920
matter if I got on at Southampton

199
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:12,550
probably not it's more important to know

200
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,990
whether I was a passenger class I had so

201
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,479
now we've looked at our data we kind of

202
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,680
understand what our data is we kind of

203
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,100
know what columns are going to be

204
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,709
important to us or and machine-learning

205
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,620
speak we know what features are

206
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:29,710
important to us so we've looked at our

207
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,870
data the next thing we do is we select

208
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:34,120
now you'll notice that I'm searching for

209
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,480
things up here this is the easiest way

210
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:42,470
to find things

211
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:46,590
so select and then if I scroll down here

212
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:51,210
went too far select columns in our data

213
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:53,160
set now I need to connect things and

214
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,440
you'll notice that when I click on the

215
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,140
button here it only gives me one place

216
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,050
to connect it they make it very easy to

217
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,640
know where your connectors need to go so

218
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,219
we've connected our data set but we

219
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,990
still have a red exclamation meaning

220
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,240
there's something else that we need to

221
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,040
do so we click and you'll notice that

222
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,820
over here we have a select columns so

223
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,310
we're going to launch a column selector

224
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,500
and we're gonna pick our column so this

225
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,319
is where what columns were important to

226
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,500
us well we knew survived was important

227
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,270
because that's our label passenger class

228
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,250
was important name not so much

229
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:35,069
definitely the sex of the passenger

230
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,500
their age was very important whether

231
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,560
they were traveling with somebody so

232
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,720
parent sibling or our parent child or

233
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,400
sibling ticket wasn't important remember

234
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,940
fare we're gonna put it over there even

235
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,050
though we might skew our data a little

236
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,000
bit and then we don't need the other

237
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:58,969
ones so these are the columns that we

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:07,050
think are important agreed okay

239
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:09,330
so somewhere on here I should have too

240
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,760
far I can't hardly see it so we've

241
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:15,780
selected our columns now next thing we

242
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,790
need to do is fix that age problem so we

243
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,520
need to do something called clean our

244
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,699
data so we need to clean our missing

245
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,220
data so we're gonna drag it over connect

246
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,340
it up again so this way our data is

247
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,950
filtering down now so now we need to

248
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,250
clean which column do we need to clean

249
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,320
and we're not going to do all columns

250
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,420
we're going to begin with no columns and

251
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,590
we're going to include based on the name

252
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:46,760
and we're gonna find age so that's the

253
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,760
only one we need to clean

254
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:55,090
I'm so glad I got them really just top

255
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:59,590
corner of that circle so now how do we

256
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:04,090
clean it though so our options are we

257
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:06,010
can substitute a value we can just

258
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,070
delete it completely we can remove the

259
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:11,970
entire column we can remove any row that

260
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:16,510
is blank but if we do that we only have

261
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:18,670
891 rows right now so if we remove them

262
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,130
we're getting rid of quite a bit of our

263
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,860
data that's gonna impact how well our

264
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:28,540
module learns so we're going to replace

265
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,980
it with the median now we don't want to

266
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,930
replate we could replace it with a

267
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,300
custom value we could say replace it

268
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,719
with a zero but then we've skewed our

269
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,630
data towards the younger end if we say

270
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,090
replace it with 75 we skew it the other

271
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:48,280
way but let's pick the middle and it

272
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:50,440
will automatically create calculate what

273
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,540
the mean and the median is and we can go

274
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,540
back up here and see what that is so if

275
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,540
we go back to our visualize

276
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:19,069
Oh slow Network I shouldn't have done

277
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:19,069
that just gonna have to go

278
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:27,120
and it's will eventually come up but if

279
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,810
you go into the visualize it will give

280
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:36,420
you the mean so if you go back to the

281
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:41,819
age and our statistics oops

282
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:44,069
age you'll notice that we have almost a

283
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,400
pretty standard distribution meaning

284
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:51,570
that most people fall between sixteen

285
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,970
and forty and if you look up here it

286
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,300
tells us that our mean is 29 and our

287
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,130
median is 28 so mean and median are

288
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,150
fairly close together so we're just

289
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:05,189
gonna use the median we're gonna use 28

290
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:08,699
but it can do that for us automatically

291
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,770
so you'll notice over here I picked

292
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:14,250
median there

293
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,210
so we've now cleaned our data what do we

294
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,720
need to do next

295
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:22,880
the next thing is splitting it so when

296
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:30,710
you're doing your training on these

297
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:34,760
scroll down nope I can't see where my

298
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,760
thing is here

299
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,809
[Music]

300
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:52,479
oops that's too far so need to connect

301
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,840
up we're gonna use our that's really

302
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,250
small

303
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,870
you guys can't see it now and I can't

304
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:00,550
move all right

305
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,410
so you'll notice that we had two buttons

306
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,719
here one is our clean data set and the

307
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,880
other one is a transformation we didn't

308
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,430
do a transformation we're just using our

309
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,290
clean data set so this is the one that

310
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:14,430
I'm picking the side that I'm picking so

311
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:17,770
now we need to split our data this is

312
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:22,270
whatever you think is best you know your

313
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:25,329
data so academics like to do 80/20 some

314
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:28,000
people like to do 7525 but what we're

315
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:31,900
doing is we're splitting into a training

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,640
data set and a test data set so our

317
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,439
training is what we're going to use to

318
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,050
train our models so it can figure out

319
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,680
which ones which features are important

320
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:46,959
the test piece is to test how well our

321
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:50,349
model learned so I'm gonna split it 8020

322
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,460
just because I like 80/20 and then even

323
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,800
has some other things here like

324
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,230
randomized to split even started with a

325
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,410
seed so that every time you split it you

326
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:02,620
get the same thing I'm gonna randomize

327
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,030
the seed so that anytime I run this the

328
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,680
data it looks is gonna look a little

329
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,949
different means we get some different

330
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,250
numbers at the end but for this example

331
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:15,069
that's okay so now we've split the data

332
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,329
and weren't done with our data piece now

333
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,730
we need to start looking at our

334
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:22,030
classification algorithms so we're gonna

335
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:28,470
look for train the model and you'll

336
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:32,220
notice down here where's my training

337
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:35,399
train model now we're going to do this

338
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,179
twice so I'm going to put two of them on

339
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:42,268
here so we need to connect and you'll

340
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:45,210
notice again it makes it so that I know

341
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:47,610
where my connection goes so you see that

342
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:50,639
when I do this I have two green dots so

343
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,699
I am going to connect this twice so that

344
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:58,019
our training data goes to both of our

345
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,669
training model modules so now we have

346
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,590
our training but you'll notice that

347
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:01,980
there is another dot here what else do I

348
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,840
need

349
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,669
well I need to know how to classify it

350
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,168
so I'm going to look for our

351
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:16,320
classification now this is where what

352
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:20,100
does all of these mean and this is one

353
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:24,330
of the reasons why I went to class so

354
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:28,230
you've got a lot of options here we know

355
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:30,629
that our data has two it's a two class

356
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,149
problem you live or you die

357
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:35,459
so I'm not going to use any of the multi

358
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:38,158
class so I'm gonna look at these two

359
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,039
classes then which ones of these so I

360
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:45,240
think is better

361
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:47,070
pick you can't go wrong on this if you

362
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,929
don't like the answers that you get you

363
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,490
can come back in and take another one

364
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:54,659
and look at it again and see if it does

365
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,730
any better so your base this is what

366
00:18:54,659 --> 00:19:00,179
does like your spam filtering that uses

367
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:02,690
a Bayesian model boosted in decision

368
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:05,460
trees this is where you start

369
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,769
male/female that's a that's a decision

370
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,899
and then it goes down a tree if it's

371
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,549
male what was your age that's another

372
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,939
decision and it branches out so it

373
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:16,730
creates a tree decision jungle just

374
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,070
means you have a bunch of decision trees

375
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,730
so you can go and read what all of these

376
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:28,950
are we're just gonna pick two let's pick

377
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:32,930
a decision forest and let's go ahead and

378
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:36,820
pick a neural network

379
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:42,500
you guys this is gonna get messy big

380
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:45,530
let's take that back over try to keep

381
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,800
this a little clean okay so now we need

382
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:51,920
to connect that up there and we need to

383
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,930
connect to this one up over here we

384
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,870
still have a red exclamation point

385
00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:00,860
though so what else do we need we need a

386
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:04,340
value so if we click on this we need to

387
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:06,590
pick a selector and we had tells us

388
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,310
launched the column selector this is

389
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:15,050
where we need to tell what our label is

390
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:21,280
so our label data is there survived so

391
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:21,280
we've done that one can do the other one

392
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:37,939
okay so we have two models now we've

393
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:42,889
trained them we've given them data we

394
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:46,220
need to next do ask or how well has our

395
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:50,750
training module worked so we're going to

396
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:54,140
score first and we need to do this twice

397
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:57,890
we need to have one for each one we

398
00:20:54,140 --> 00:21:02,270
connect this up here and this one over

399
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:04,580
here now when we split our data this is

400
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:07,399
where that test data set comes into

401
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:11,289
place so you'll notice that we can come

402
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:15,709
and take this over oops click the button

403
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:17,809
over there so now our test data is going

404
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:21,860
down to our scoring so now it's going to

405
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:24,860
evaluate how well it when we train the

406
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:29,000
model and then the last piece is to

407
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:31,360
evaluate which one of these is better so

408
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,789
we're going to evaluate both of them and

409
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,860
that's it we've built a machine learning

410
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:43,549
model now how well does it work

411
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:46,340
so let's run it oh I missed you're right

412
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:52,510
thank you and you'll notice it didn't

413
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:52,510
run okay so now we run it

414
00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:01,070
it's going to take it a few minutes but

415
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:04,220
it is going to come up you'll notice

416
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,110
that we start with clocks that just

417
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,520
means it hasn't got to that point yet

418
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,520
green checkmarks me

419
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:22,020
means that it passed the test if you see

420
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:25,360
one of these probably has a spinning

421
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,240
there it is the spinning means it's

422
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,299
that's the piece that it's working on

423
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:35,559
this usually takes anywhere from 30

424
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:39,580
seconds to 2 minutes any questions why

425
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:42,280
that's running pretty clear so far not

426
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:51,010
the magic that you that the vendors will

427
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:52,809
let you think it is yeah I run this all

428
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:56,470
the time and haven't ran into any

429
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:58,990
charges yet so but I don't know if

430
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,120
that's just the license I ran it through

431
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,220
school and I ran it through I'm running

432
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,879
it through work and I haven't ran into

433
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:13,210
any charges yet so I can't answer that

434
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:15,370
question all right we're done you notice

435
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:19,000
that we got green checkmarks so we

436
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:23,260
finished it now let's see how well we

437
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,150
did so right click and you go to your

438
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,150
evaluation results and visualize

439
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:35,169
so blue is always the one that was on

440
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:37,299
the left the reddish maroon color was on

441
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:41,049
the right so it starts with the blue

442
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:45,750
this is the blue line and down here it

443
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:48,760
gives you a bunch of numbers which I

444
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:51,400
could go into the math behind all of

445
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,790
those but then we're gonna be here for a

446
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,530
couple hours and nobody wants to get

447
00:23:54,790 --> 00:24:00,159
into the bath piece right after lunch

448
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:04,379
right so we're just gonna focus on the

449
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:07,150
f1 score just know that f1 score

450
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,919
balances your recall accuracy and

451
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,530
precision

452
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,970
so this that's the more balanced score

453
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,720
that you need to focus on here

454
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:20,080
so our what I do on the side the

455
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:25,570
decision jungle decision force our F

456
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:28,030
score is 68 so not bad this part over

457
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:31,090
here this is called your confusion

458
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,370
matrix so how many did it get right to

459
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,970
positive how many did it get wrong which

460
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:39,729
was your your false positive

461
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:44,710
so there's your confusion matrix and it

462
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:46,660
does get pretty confusing oops I close

463
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:51,970
that and I didn't mean to sorry about

464
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:54,520
that so if you want to look at the other

465
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,700
one so let's highlight the maroon one

466
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,750
and you'll see that our f1 score on this

467
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,210
one is 71

468
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,850
so the neural network did slightly

469
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:07,299
better so that's the one we're going to

470
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,280
keep so now we know which one we're

471
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,139
gonna use so we're gonna get rid of

472
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,840
these other ones we don't need to

473
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:20,410
evaluate anymore we don't need this

474
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:23,290
score we're not gonna keep that one and

475
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:25,600
we're not gonna keep that one so let's

476
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:29,649
move these things over and make it a

477
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:33,129
little cleaner now since I deleted

478
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:37,410
things I have to run it again make sure

479
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,410
I didn't introduce any errors to it

480
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,000
we're good that one ran fast like it so

481
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,700
hmm

482
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,390
we're now ready to start looking at this

483
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,810
as a web service so we're going to set

484
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:55,220
this up as a predictive web service

485
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,169
you'll notice that when I do this is

486
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,710
going to go through some transformations

487
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:03,170
here does some things its packaging

488
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,090
things up and I come up with something

489
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,940
that looks a little bit different than

490
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:12,350
what I had before once that's done I

491
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,490
have to run it again what it does is

492
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,919
it's going to make sure that the

493
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:20,210
transformations that it did didn't break

494
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:31,160
anything so it's running again you'll

495
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:32,420
notice that it's running up here ok

496
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,570
we're finished

497
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:39,310
no errors everything is green so now

498
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,310
let's deploy it as a web service

499
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:53,529
we are now ready to run data against our

500
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:55,989
model and you'll notice that we have an

501
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:59,200
API key so we could set this up as a

502
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:01,929
website if we wanted but I frankly don't

503
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:06,549
have time to code a really nice webpage

504
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:10,539
for this so what we're gonna do is use

505
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:14,739
it under an excel so we're going to

506
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:17,820
download this excel 2013 or later yes

507
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:17,820
I'm going to have sample data

508
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:31,439
and I'm gonna save it not there I'm

509
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:34,170
gonna save it under here and I've

510
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,230
learned that sometimes if I click on it

511
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:43,560
down here it gets confused so I'm gonna

512
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:45,740
open it from here instead and this is

513
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:49,020
just going to be an Excel spreadsheet

514
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,760
now this is where I'm going to tell you

515
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,639
to do things that as a security

516
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,680
professional make me horrified but we're

517
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,840
gonna do it anyway we're gonna enable

518
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,280
editing we're gonna click that button

519
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,720
and then the next thing we're gonna do

520
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,000
the other box the first time that you

521
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,860
run this the other box that pops up says

522
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:15,300
do you want to install this add-on from

523
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:18,419
office be a user Yolo click it do it so

524
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,960
I have that loaded on here too so now

525
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,490
I'm going to tie my Excel to that

526
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,300
predictive web service that we just

527
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:29,070
created on Azure studio and you'll

528
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,550
notice that it's now connected and I

529
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:34,679
have other things that I have to do I'm

530
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:37,350
going to say you sample data so I can

531
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,620
just see what that data was like from

532
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:44,399
our training set and then I'm going to

533
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,989
pick a row here and I always do this

534
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,380
backwards so I'm gonna actually try to

535
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:54,420
be smart about this today I'm going to

536
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:57,870
select this row this is where I'm going

537
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:01,620
to type in my data and I'm going to say

538
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:06,449
my data does not have headers and my

539
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:11,850
output is going to be down here on 15 so

540
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:13,830
I think I can just type in a 15 don't

541
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,590
include headers on this one and I wanted

542
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:20,639
to auto per day so as we're typing in it

543
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:22,379
should start doing our predictions now

544
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,430
if I didn't screw this up

545
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:29,220
so passenger ID we know that we don't

546
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,570
have a passenger ID survived is what

547
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,570
we're actually trying to predict so I'm

548
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,990
going to leave that one I am a

549
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,470
first-class pass

550
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:41,019
my name is Beth and you'll notice as I'm

551
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,909
doing this it's checking I don't have

552
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:48,190
enough in here yet for it to do their

553
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:51,809
prediction I am female I will tell you

554
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:56,080
my age for another four days by the way

555
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:58,178
I am traveling alone I'm so I have

556
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,149
nothing there and you'll see again it's

557
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:04,830
predicting thinking about it and then

558
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:11,590
how much did I pay for my fare I paid

559
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:17,860
$75 I now get a percentage

560
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:20,918
I am 94% likely to survive the sinking

561
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:24,158
of the Titanic but I can change these

562
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:29,470
values now and it will change this so if

563
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:32,889
I change this to male 24% it is now

564
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,990
making calls out to our algorithm to

565
00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:38,139
figure out what our survival rate might

566
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:40,210
be and you'll notice that I could make

567
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:43,029
this anything and it doesn't change that

568
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,639
because name wasn't important but

569
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:50,320
travelling with passengers are with

570
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:52,209
parents our child for a male it doesn't

571
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,360
change it changed it a little bit from

572
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:58,990
24 to 26 what if I change this to a

573
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:05,469
third class passenger ouch

574
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:07,750
4% you're probably gonna die so that is

575
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,539
how that works that is making

576
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,519
predictions based on our training set of

577
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:14,200
data so you can sit here and you can

578
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:15,750
change these values however you want

579
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:24,549
them what if I change this back to

580
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:28,179
female 34% what I learned from doing

581
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:30,250
this never travel third class always

582
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:33,730
travel first because if you I take that

583
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:35,559
to first class I'm at 93% now just

584
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:42,850
changing the passenger class what about

585
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:45,350
second class oops wrong field 93 it just

586
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:48,439
dropped it just a tiny bit

587
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:53,870
pretty cool huh you've just created your

588
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:59,110
first machine learning model so let's go

589
00:31:53,870 --> 00:32:04,549
back to the slides now I did if you want

590
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:06,860
everything that I did I put in my slide

591
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:08,870
deck just in case something broken I

592
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,689
couldn't do a live demo so if you're

593
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:15,529
interested in trying this just let me

594
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,399
know I'll send you the slides because

595
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:20,480
it's all there

596
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,719
and I also had something in here

597
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,259
remember I talked about precision recall

598
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:30,200
this was a slide if I it helps kind of

599
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:32,299
understand what it is there's also some

600
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:43,220
links to articles to help you understand

601
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:45,620
it better so alright links so here's the

602
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,340
resources so if you want to try to play

603
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,340
this on your own

604
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,119
[Music]

605
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,160
all right

606
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:16,019
[Music]

607
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,779
[Music]

608
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:39,449
alright so the link if you want to try

609
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:43,439
this is the azure machine learning

610
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:45,720
net kaggle is where I got the Titanic

611
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,309
data set they have a bunch of other

612
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,779
stuff out there so if you're interested

613
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:50,700
in learning this and doing some more

614
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:52,830
they have all kinds of data sets out

615
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:57,989
there that you can play with they also

616
00:33:52,830 --> 00:34:00,509
do competitions so if you start playing

617
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:03,210
with this you can submit you can create

618
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:06,450
your model ensemble whatever you want to

619
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,369
do and submit it to the competitions I

620
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,049
wanted to show you this one this is

621
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:20,579
probably going to break again because I

622
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:22,819
didn't do this before yep alright to go

623
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,819
back

624
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,489
duplicate

625
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:44,159
so what we could have done is done

626
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:48,299
something really thank you all right um

627
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,639
data science dojo they built something

628
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,950
around the Titanic data you know I said

629
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,700
you had an API key you could build

630
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:58,439
something like this and it does the same

631
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,240
thing that our spreadsheet was doing was

632
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:05,810
it first class second class third class

633
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:12,870
I'm female I'm old not that old

634
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:15,380
traveling alone and I pay what did I say

635
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,380
75

636
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,480
um

637
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,119
[Music]

638
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,240
now we're gonna get a different answer

639
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:29,050
than what I did because they use

640
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,598
different features this one says I have

641
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:34,900
a 24 percent chance of surviving we're

642
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:38,079
on the one that I did I had what was it

643
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,760
93 94 percent so just different features

644
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,790
they picked probably a different

645
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,579
classification than what I did so it

646
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:50,050
that's where you can get different

647
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:51,640
answers so you can play with that one

648
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:55,390
again that link is out here on the

649
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:57,819
slides also and then again accuracy

650
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,859
precision recall a couple links to help

651
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:04,300
explain what those are instead of just

652
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:05,710
saying use the up score last thing I

653
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:10,540
want to leave you with I found this one

654
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:12,880
really funny it's a little blurry so

655
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,320
there are many different types of

656
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,690
machine learning things out there and

657
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,780
it's being used more and more so if you

658
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:22,270
think of your self-driving cars that is

659
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,280
using a visual machine learning is that

660
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:28,750
a person is that a lamppost is that a

661
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,910
mailbox it is using the machine learning

662
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,099
and the visual pieces of that for the

663
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:35,740
self-driving car you've got voice

664
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:39,609
recognition you know your prompts on

665
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:42,098
your the phone systems and how to get it

666
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:43,589
routed to the right place that's using

667
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:46,990
machine learning in the background

668
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:49,029
Amazon's recommendation engine Netflix

669
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:51,819
you should watch this next that's all

670
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:53,829
built on machine learning so there's a

671
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:55,540
lot of things that are out there but if

672
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:58,569
you put all those machine learning

673
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:05,230
pieces together you end up with the

674
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:08,230
Terminator just remember that so thank

675
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:11,490
you are there any questions anything I

676
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,490
can try to answer

677
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:18,280
[Music]

678
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:34,700
so the question was what was I using to

679
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:37,099
do that that was actually in the cloud

680
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,830
that's the Azure machine learning studio

681
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:42,470
and that was that first link on the

682
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:56,779
resources slide right there that's

683
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:58,580
that's where I went yes you can change

684
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,690
the weight so on the features that we

685
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:04,040
selected can we make a weight for

686
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,589
changing which features are more

687
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,210
important than others yes you can that's

688
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:10,369
getting into the more advanced stuff

689
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,530
that I thought might be a little too

690
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:14,859
it'd take me too long to get through all

691
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,859
of it

692
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:23,449
[Music]

693
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,729
[Music]

694
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:34,578
which is more important on those in the

695
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:36,859
decision tree there is I'd have to go

696
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:39,559
back I've looked at it but I can't

697
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:44,089
remember where I found that it's under

698
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:46,910
the evaluation piece and it was

699
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:48,589
something selected on you know how I

700
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,979
selecting the columns and they there's

701
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:53,930
something on that side I'd have to find

702
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:59,029
it if you email me so I can remember to

703
00:38:53,930 --> 00:39:01,098
go look it up it is there yeah yep

704
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:02,839
and one thing I didn't show is you know

705
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:04,400
if we weren't happy with the results

706
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:06,670
that we were getting we could have went

707
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,670
back in you know if we thought that Fair

708
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:13,369
was influencing it too much we could

709
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,950
have went back in and unselected that

710
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:19,130
and ran it you can change any of that

711
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:21,589
stuff before you do that transformation

712
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,660
to deploy it as a web service so you

713
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:26,029
could have went back in and edited any

714
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:28,489
of those things if you didn't like how

715
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:29,380
it was working if you thought you could

716
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:34,309
do better

717
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:37,519
71 for that F score it's a little better

718
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:39,170
than guessing but it's not when you're

719
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:43,368
actually deploying these you're gonna

720
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:46,039
try to get that F score up to 85 90

721
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:49,039
somewhere in there so that it's just a

722
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:51,949
little bit better than guessing I didn't

723
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:54,289
play with this one as I was doing this

724
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:56,150
demo to try to get that F score up I

725
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:59,209
would to me it was more important to get

726
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:02,749
through the demo than it was to try to

727
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:04,819
get that F score higher but if you're

728
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:09,109
gonna do anything with this you're gonna

729
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:14,140
try to maximize that F score good

730
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:14,140
question thank you anything else yes

731
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:20,040
[Music]

732
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:36,050
okay I caught about half of that so

733
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,049
speak

734
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:46,840
[Music]

735
00:40:51,890 --> 00:41:00,650
so the question was as I went through

736
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,239
and I selected columns I realized that

737
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,970
it wasn't working as well as I thought

738
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:07,549
and I needed to add more data how did I

739
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:10,368
know that if I couldn't get that F score

740
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:12,799
up where I needed it to be I realized

741
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:17,239
that I don't have all the data so a good

742
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:20,349
example of that was in one of my classes

743
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:24,759
we were playing with coaches salaries

744
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:29,150
and what impacted how much a sec

745
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:33,920
football coach salary made and it wasn't

746
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:38,569
just a factor of school size and grades

747
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:44,289
we had to get how big was the football

748
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:44,288
stadium how many fans would come

749
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:51,288
endorsement contracts so at that point I

750
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,239
couldn't just go out to the NCAA and

751
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,460
pull down their salary information and

752
00:41:53,239 --> 00:42:00,109
school information I actually had to

753
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:02,869
scrape the Wikipedia page to get stadium

754
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:04,700
information to know how many fans would

755
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:07,450
come to a game and then I had to go

756
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,618
scrape another website to get data on

757
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,629
endorsement money that they might be

758
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:15,410
making because that's all has to be

759
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:17,539
reported so you know the first one it's

760
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,569
like oh I can do this I can just check

761
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:23,599
student body population athletic

762
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:27,680
performance and athletic grades and

763
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,599
maybe figure out a salary but when I

764
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,098
couldn't get that F score up it's like

765
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,829
okay well now I need to add more data

766
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:36,430
sources and figuring out how to add that

767
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:36,430
data in

768
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:48,269
so why would I exclude it if it's not

769
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:50,880
bringing me again it's that F score if

770
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:53,308
it there's too much jitter in there and

771
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,910
I can never get that F score to

772
00:42:53,309 --> 00:43:00,569
stabilize I can also not just add date I

773
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,339
can remove data so if we had put name in

774
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:04,859
there that would have caused too much

775
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:07,319
jitter because name really doesn't mean

776
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:09,930
anything you can't tell anything by the

777
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:12,719
name you know even if you think oh well

778
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,368
we can tell that's a female name versus

779
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:20,339
a male name you've got names in there

780
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:22,829
that are like missus instead of using

781
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:26,219
their missus bath young it's going to be

782
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:28,170
missus and the husband's name so it's

783
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:30,779
very hard to just pick out the name and

784
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:32,309
know whether it's male or female so it's

785
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:34,519
going to cost too much jitter in the

786
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,519
data

787
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,460
[Music]

788
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:48,199
that's where we mean to know our data

789
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:52,279
and freight them it's just a feature

790
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:55,399
that it it's a yes on a neural network

791
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:58,159
that is going to drop on that jitter it

792
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:59,509
will start ignoring it but if we know

793
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,549
that it's going to cause a problem to

794
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:02,809
begin with why why included it's just

795
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:06,489
one thing that we don't need to include

796
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:06,489
and look at

797
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:19,450
[Music]

798
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:21,609
so other things that are again I picked

799
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:24,790
a sure because it was drag-and-drop

800
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:27,910
fairly easy to understand the industry

801
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:31,870
standard is going to be using our so

802
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:38,680
look at our studio you can also there's

803
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:40,960
Python google has a it's Google code I

804
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,930
can't think of what the URL is off the

805
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,320
top of my head but Google as a place

806
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:51,190
kind of like this where you can log in

807
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:55,300
use it again I used it through school so

808
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,280
they had G sweet but it's a place where

809
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,010
you can type in Python code and run it

810
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,310
there's also a dragon drop I think in

811
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:07,729
there

812
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:14,219
[Music]

813
00:45:07,729 --> 00:45:17,968
yeah I prefer our studio for that it's

814
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:18,919
trying to think of the other I just lost

815
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:21,659
it

816
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:23,519
it's another cloud solution but iBM has

817
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:33,239
one

818
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:39,419
I just forgot it no it's not Watson but

819
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:41,009
it's like it's gone down sorry but iBM

820
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:43,828
has a solution if you look for but again

821
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:46,279
that one's in the cloud so machine on

822
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:54,630
the machine I would run our studio or

823
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:58,409
Python uh-huh anything else okay

824
00:45:54,630 --> 00:46:02,519
I don't think I put my email address on

825
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:10,049
here anywhere that I add this you can

826
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:12,439
find me on Twitter remember my own email

827
00:46:10,049 --> 00:46:12,439
address

828
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:20,700
you can find me there to make it bigger

829
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,700
so you guys can see it
