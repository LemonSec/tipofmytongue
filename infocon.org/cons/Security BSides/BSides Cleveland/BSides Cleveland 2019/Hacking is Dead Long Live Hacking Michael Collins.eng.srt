1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
michael collins i got talking to the

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,850
mike I tend to wander so I'm gonna have

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,420
to stand in front of the mic remind me

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,410
when I'm doing this I bought my robot

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,570
I'll explain him here in a second but

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,940
but yeah I'm here today to talk about

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,550
how hacking is dead which is a terrible

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,109
intro to a hacking conference but I

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,460
promise there's light at the end of the

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,119
tunnel and we'll kind of we'll kind of

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,529
talk through that so thanks to everybody

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,769
besides for putting on a really awesome

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,899
awesome conference seeing this thing bro

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,860
I think first year I came it was what 60

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,770
some-odd people

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,629
I heard it's 300 this year and that

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,969
there was approximately like an 80

18
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,120
person waitlist to be able to get into

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:48,230
this thing so I primarily to see the

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,480
keynote talk apparently I don't know so

21
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,828
thanks thanks Adrian Crenshaw for doing

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,398
all the video for this it's a it's a

23
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,899
really nice my my talk that I did at

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,489
Derby con two years ago is actually

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,789
taped and it's really nice what it's

26
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,018
taped sorry it's it's reported it's a

27
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,420
really nice way to you know be able to

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,860
kind of send people link and show kind

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,939
of you know your speaking skills kind of

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,189
stuff you worked on on things like that

31
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,419
so it's a nice it's a nice bonus to have

32
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,699
him here

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,270
big thanks to Chris Sanders for putting

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,430
on an awesome training yesterday the he

35
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,839
wrote practical packet analysis which is

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,130
basically the Bible on this stuff so

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
it's really cool to have him come into a

38
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,869
conference like this and do some

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,490
training thanks for letting me talk at

40
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,619
10 o'clock in the morning instead of 8

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,030
I'm a little a little spunkier after I

42
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,619
get some coffee and miso and I do I will

43
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,130
warn you I get a little chatty sometimes

44
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,720
so I've been told this time that Ben

45
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,670
will actually come tackle me to get me

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:53,009
off stage if if I talk too long so

47
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:54,570
speaking of it's 1007 ok and then you

48
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,250
may notice I just wanted to bring this

49
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,449
up I'm kind of in the middle of an

50
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,820
awkward breakup I've truly had a Matt I

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,799
I recently decided to get this really

52
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,529
nice Alienware a laptop because I could

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,160
do some gaming on it super powerful it's

54
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,100
way more powerful than my Mac

55
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,690
and as you can see I have my Mac with me

56
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,250
so I'm not really sure what I'm gonna do

57
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:27,880
in May I may go and get a Mac actually

58
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:30,160
again so I don't so if you were here two

59
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,470
years ago you might remember me I gave a

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,560
talk called drone delivered attack

61
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:39,580
platform which is basically using a

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,760
drone to deliver a wireless hacking drop

63
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,110
kit and I wrote the the talk from the

64
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,730
perspective of me attacking my

65
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,590
chicken-coop to kind of take the sting

66
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,850
out of it they'd actually propped up a

67
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,760
wireless network and we're doing some

68
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,829
stuff looking at a salacious pictures of

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,760
roosters it turned out on the internet

70
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,990
but but I bring that up because one of

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,140
the things I want to talk about is I've

72
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:04,150
continued to kind of evolve my kit so

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,390
I've managed to turn it into robot form

74
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,920
which is a completely useless it's

75
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,420
actually better for the drone because he

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,670
can like fly over fences at least this

77
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,940
guy's really slow but what's cool is

78
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,739
because I've coupled the kind of the

79
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,620
architecture of the driving with the

80
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,780
architecture of the hacking it uses the

81
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,820
trusted set tab like I did on my drone

82
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,040
project to call back out over Wi-Fi and

83
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,859
call home which means basically that I

84
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,840
can send this to LA have somebody power

85
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,210
it on it would call home and I could

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,500
drive it around as if I was standing

87
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,560
five feet away from it which is which is

88
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,640
pretty cool so now and the reason I

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,160
brought that up is because in my

90
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,320
original talk I had decoupled the

91
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,390
hacking kit from kind of the drive

92
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,130
mechanism of the drone now I'm kind of

93
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,570
back to it would be kind of cool to kind

94
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,740
of couple those again because you can do

95
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,440
the same thing with the drone again

96
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,640
right basically have the drone call back

97
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,650
out over the Internet

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,929
you know VPN into it and you could you

99
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,880
could literally drive the drone from you

100
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,550
know anywhere as long as you were within

101
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,230
within cellphone range so just just

102
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:10,570
brought that up is kind of a kind of a

103
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:13,149
cool aside this is actually kind of it's

104
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,620
it's my current kit - my software and I

105
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,420
just wanted to kind of bring that up for

106
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,700
one reason because one of the things

107
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,299
that we're gonna do today is this is

108
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,858
open to be able to hack into

109
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,599
so I'm gonna I'm gonna plug this in

110
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,370
because one of the things I'm gonna talk

111
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:27,770
about is kind of new kind of technology

112
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,620
and kind of looking at new technology to

113
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,310
hack in to things like that so I propped

114
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,810
my robot up if you can hack into him

115
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,120
before the end of the day and send me a

116
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,099
picture from the front of the camera of

117
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,080
yourself well we'll have some will have

118
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:44,449
some giveaways for you so I think I

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,550
think I heard a new car is what I heard

120
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,930
you're getting a literally a new car if

121
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,520
you if you break into the robot that's

122
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,530
what the besides people told me it's in

123
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:57,169
the budget so it's it's gonna be okay

124
00:04:51,530 --> 00:05:01,159
yeah so there's a couple talks I decided

125
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:03,500
not to give I'm an avid I'm gonna have a

126
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:06,590
jiu-jitsu practitioner when I started I

127
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,659
wait around 235 pounds I've little down

128
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,539
a little bit since then but there's a

129
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:13,159
lot of kind of similarities between how

130
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:16,009
you learn jujitsu and how you learn

131
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,330
hacking it's very organic a lot of times

132
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,509
you feel like you're really not getting

133
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,490
anywhere you it's good to kind of pick

134
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,990
skills and kind of focus on them so that

135
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,789
was gonna be one of my talks that one's

136
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,229
on the cutting room floor I'm not giving

137
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:31,430
that one today obviously but I want to

138
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:35,508
bring that up your phone is listening to

139
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,680
you when I when I first saw this this is

140
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:38,779
one of those things where like your

141
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,539
sister-in-law sends you something and

142
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:43,370
she's like no Mike really you know

143
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:45,560
Facebook Messenger is listening to you

144
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,789
they listen to all your stuff and and

145
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,819
I'm thinking now there's there's really

146
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:52,430
no way and then you know over time

147
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:53,719
there's been some really weird things

148
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,889
that have happened I think everybody

149
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,960
here at this point has probably had

150
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,819
something happen where you're sitting

151
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,770
around at dinner you're talking about

152
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,210
some really obtuse subject that you

153
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,919
would never Google you probably never

154
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,318
have googled and next thing you know

155
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,469
it's in the the newsfeed on your on your

156
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,449
phone so so I thought that was

157
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,940
interesting the other interesting part

158
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,440
about it is you know how is nobody kind

159
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,870
of kind of figured that part out yet

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,159
well it turns out that the some of these

161
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,590
clients are pretty hard to get in the

162
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:24,800
middle of they're pretty hard to hack

163
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,750
and I I think you know some of it is

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,600
probably using code that is used for

165
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,850
other stuff so then I was at

166
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,220
at besides in Las Vegas and this guy

167
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,900
gave this talk about robot hacking you

168
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,740
see you see how I ended up here this is

169
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,820
this is a continuous story I promise and

170
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,990
one of the things he talked about it was

171
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,400
super interesting I was like who cares

172
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,750
if somebody can hack into your robot

173
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,549
right like I can drive your robot around

174
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,350
who really cares well he's talking about

175
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,060
all the stuff that your robot can do and

176
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,560
you know what it's got a GPS in it it's

177
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,300
got this other stuff and he's like and

178
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,290
it's got a gyroscope in it

179
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,560
and your your gyroscope can be used as a

180
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:03,190
microphone and so then I was like okay

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,720
so your your phone has a gyroscope in it

182
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,040
let's just pretend because all of the

183
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,780
all of the companies deny that they're

184
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,240
listening to you on your microphone to

185
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,150
inform ads right what if they're using

186
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,220
the gyroscope on your phone to process

187
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,799
vibrations and it knows if it sees a

188
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,630
certain pattern of vibrations that that

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,430
meant you talked about camping and then

190
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,540
all of a sudden you know it's popping up

191
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,900
camping ads and things like that

192
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:31,010
completely a theory I'm just you know

193
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,359
just just just bring that up so not what

194
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,590
we're talking about today feel free to

195
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,510
steal that talk idea by the way if you

196
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,070
want to do the research and stuff it

197
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,490
turns out it's very difficult to like

198
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,110
sit in a restaurant and just organically

199
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,120
like talk about camping and then it

200
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:48,590
never it just never does it does the one

201
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,090
you don't want it to do it so so what

202
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,419
we're here to talk about today is things

203
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:55,429
that kill our love it's not it's not my

204
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,160
needy nature it's I'm actually talking

205
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,360
about a love of hacking so we're gonna

206
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,730
we're gonna talk through a few things

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,360
and kind of the reason I got the idea

208
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,390
for this this talk is that and I go way

209
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,480
back so I I started literally hacking

210
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,820
when I was in sixth grade I'm 47 now so

211
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,760
it's it's been a while I've probably

212
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,920
been doing infoset and ethical hacking

213
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,480
stuff for probably about 25 years now so

214
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,590
I have a I have a long history in this

215
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,180
and the the thing that's happened you

216
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,710
know a number of times over the years is

217
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,420
people you know some new technology will

218
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,580
come up and people would be like well

219
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,340
this is gonna be the end of the need for

220
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,400
hacking skills right you know you know

221
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,810
it could be automation you know we'll

222
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
talk

223
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,478
endpoint protection I've heard a lot

224
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,098
where it's like oh you're not gonna be

225
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,050
able to get something running on you

226
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:45,880
know the actual device I'm not gonna

227
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,170
steal too much thunder on the endpoint

228
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,060
protection stuff because my buddy

229
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,469
Brandon is gonna be giving a really good

230
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,420
talk on that stuff but we will talk

231
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,440
about that a little bit but the these

232
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,209
are the things that have kind of come up

233
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,870
over the years so we'll talk about kind

234
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:01,930
of arms races and some examples of that

235
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,640
automation the decline in available

236
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,370
exploit code which i think is a really

237
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,870
interesting kind of topic talk a little

238
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,240
bit about firewalls endpoint protection

239
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,350
and then kind of improve programming

240
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,060
frameworks and how that's kind of

241
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,100
continually kind of killing whatever the

242
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,630
latest hacks are because they build they

243
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:23,110
basically build the mitigations into the

244
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:24,970
programming frameworks over time so so

245
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,560
kind of one of the first arms races that

246
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,130
occurred and this this takes your way

247
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,319
back to I believe the the 60s originally

248
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,140
but you used to be able to do something

249
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,390
called blue boxing so interestingly

250
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,300
enough the guy that's giving the last

251
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,770
talk mentions the same computer that I

252
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,240
started on back in the day which was a

253
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:49,089
TI 99 for a it had this was in fifth

254
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,820
grade it had no floppy drive no hard

255
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,680
drive it had a it was basically like a

256
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,290
big 20 like it was a cassette you know

257
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,540
thing and you saved your programs off to

258
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,980
cassette tape there's people here young

259
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,520
enough not to remember cassette tapes I

260
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,589
promise you but but what was interesting

261
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,569
about that that computer specifically is

262
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,100
that you could generate Hertz tones you

263
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,420
could generate to hurt stones on top of

264
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,030
each other and basically generate things

265
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,979
like dial tones generate a 2600 tone

266
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,560
which is what you needed to do to take

267
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,050
over you know take over a trunk line at

268
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,050
the time the problem here is that there

269
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,030
was kind of dual back back in these days

270
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,189
people didn't really even kind of think

271
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:30,220
about hacking right like you know just

272
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,510
there hadn't been hackers before so so

273
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,890
when they designed things they would

274
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,260
typically put all the documentation

275
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,970
house the bell labs literally would put

276
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,069
all the documentation out about their

277
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,270
signaling and kind of the the tones that

278
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,860
are used and things like that

279
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,449
it turns out that there was a few people

280
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,400
that discovered this independently

281
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,380
before the documents were published

282
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,130
there used to be a whistle you can hear

283
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,319
that that would

284
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,870
blow in a Captain Crunch that would blow

285
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:55,269
2,600 but but it was basically an

286
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,579
inbound signalling earn and banned

287
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:00,069
signaling problem right the the control

288
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,660
tones got sent over the same lines that

289
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,939
that you were talking on so you could

290
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,969
you can use it to get free phone calls

291
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,860
and things you know kind of kind of

292
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,209
control long-distance mechanism this was

293
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,440
back in the day when you had to pay for

294
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,518
a long-distance I know I know I know

295
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,899
people don't remember that anymore

296
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:19,360
either but that used to be a thing so

297
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:21,040
but what ended up happening is the phone

298
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,209
company had to respond to this and then

299
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,040
this is this is going to be the pattern

300
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:26,290
that we see continually here right so

301
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,649
somebody comes up with a hack they kind

302
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,319
of they kind of automate it so that

303
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,940
other people can use it in this instance

304
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,319
people were basically building kids for

305
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,240
other people to be able to do this this

306
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:39,969
is an example of kind of one of the

307
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,769
early kids over here Steve Jobs and

308
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,990
Wozniak were famous for kind of being in

309
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:47,560
this business way back in the day and

310
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,660
then the Hat gets widespread and then

311
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,819
companies have to kind of respond to it

312
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,259
so then then there's this arms race that

313
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,939
I'm talking about right you're there's

314
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,130
this development of the stuff that's

315
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:58,630
that's you're using the hack and then

316
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,579
they start developing countermeasures

317
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,680
and then this then you start getting

318
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:05,349
this race that goes out right so so what

319
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,719
happened is they basically had to

320
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,000
develop mechanisms to mitigate this and

321
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,920
not publish how that was going on which

322
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,660
was very unusual at the time because

323
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Bell Labs basically published everything

324
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,189
that they came out with so they had to

325
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,410
do this in secret and they actually

326
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:23,139
modified the central offices to be able

327
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:26,079
to detect that tone so people started

328
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,399
getting in trouble when I say trouble I

329
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,660
don't know if anyone actually got got

330
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,009
arrested for any of this stuff for a

331
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,040
while because at first there was really

332
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:35,980
functionally no laws against against

333
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,620
hacking right so but then then

334
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,560
eventually this died off when they did

335
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,149
digital switching systems and the all

336
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,000
the signalling was kind of taken out of

337
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:47,860
and at that point so so for this example

338
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,290
this was an arms race that eventually

339
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,120
gets lost right we you know you can't

340
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:58,599
blue box anymore it's just not gonna

341
00:12:52,120 --> 00:13:00,570
work so another another kind of arms

342
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,330
race that came up was was

343
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,830
dialing I'm gonna try and show a demo

344
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,680
here let's really keep our fingers

345
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:10,980
crossed that this works but this is kind

346
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,449
of kind of back at the start of my

347
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,820
career I never really did too much blue

348
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:18,030
boxing but I did a whole bunch of war

349
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,850
dialing the the war dialing term came

350
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,800
from the movie basically the only thing

351
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,230
that's true in the movie about hacking

352
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,050
is that people did war dial all the

353
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,190
other stuff doesn't work Ally Sheedy is

354
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,569
actually not going to show up at your

355
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,150
house and come watch you hack and think

356
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,910
you're cool so I was I was completely

357
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:40,819
misled I got into this business for all

358
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,689
the wrong reasons but but you know

359
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,700
basically what you would do and this is

360
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,680
in the days of landlines I know this is

361
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,750
way way back now you know nobody nobody

362
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,699
it doesn't have a landline seriously at

363
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,630
their house anymore no one no their oh

364
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,510
my gosh okay

365
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,070
holy cow okay so you know you had to be

366
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,020
home to answer the phone

367
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,850
there was no caller ID you had to

368
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,189
literally pick the phone up and not know

369
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,520
who was on the other hand there's crazy

370
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,890
who's crazy times you know but but what

371
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,199
you could do is your computer you could

372
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,790
literally sit it up um you know I'm

373
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,130
talking out of school here I was I was

374
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,510
under 18 at the time but you know you

375
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,970
would literally in the morning you'd set

376
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,620
your computer up to to dial just a bunch

377
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,380
of numbers and your exchange during the

378
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,860
day it would find you know you'd come

379
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,660
home you know find maybe you know twenty

380
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,520
to thirty modems that you could then go

381
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,110
follow up on you know they might be

382
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,569
bulletin board systems they might be fax

383
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,820
machines they might be legitimate kind

384
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,820
of computer systems the other thing that

385
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,440
was kind of happening at that time is

386
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,060
you know again people didn't really

387
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,000
think about computer hacking is a thing

388
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,199
and even until this movie came out and

389
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,730
then you know people kind of understood

390
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,250
that there was you know some stuff going

391
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,110
on but most people didn't change the

392
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,330
defaults for the computer systems that

393
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,670
they were setting up so if you dialed up

394
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,050
to some sort of system and you did some

395
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,610
research on and looked up what the

396
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,370
default username and password was

397
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,870
typically that would get you in so you

398
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,070
know hacking was kind of easy mode back

399
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,210
in this stage right you're literally

400
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,980
just kind of dialing around looking for

401
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,780
stuff

402
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,070
and you know that's kind of how that

403
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,160
worked what what ended up happening

404
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:16,230
again is the the phone company

405
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,360
implemented digital switching stuff they

406
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,550
started having to monitor for things

407
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,800
right so so then what you would do is

408
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,300
you had instead of having like like a

409
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,040
fixed dial rate you had to kind of

410
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,449
modify your timing which we're gonna see

411
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
what the port scanning thing kind of the

412
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:33,270
arms race they're very similar kind of

413
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,650
thing goes on and so they got they got

414
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,260
much better kind of detecting this so

415
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,640
they also had to pass some laws because

416
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,860
again there was it relating kind of laws

417
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,740
against this stuff at the time so that

418
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,430
you know it was it was basically you

419
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,890
know illegal to to try and dial a device

420
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,239
that that you weren't you know it had

421
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:55,699
had no intent to kind of you know

422
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,620
communicate with so one of the popular

423
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:03,090
war dialers at the time was called tone

424
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:05,310
log if if you go out in google tone lobe

425
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,600
you come up with this guy who's who's

426
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:11,900
the greatest rapper in the world

427
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:15,120
apparently but but actually he was

428
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,130
that's the that is the guy that they

429
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,180
kind of named the the program after it's

430
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:23,689
called tone locator right so we're gonna

431
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,689
see

432
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,930
I love that when demos work thank god

433
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,070
this was the only one I didn't think was

434
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,479
gonna work so so come back me come back

435
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,640
with me in the Wayback Machine for a

436
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,520
minute I need you to imagine a couple

437
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,550
things I need you to imagine me with a

438
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,920
full head of hair it was somewhat a

439
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,349
mullet ish kind of haircut if I could

440
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,300
describe it that way I'm probably

441
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,050
getting up getting ready for high school

442
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:07,260
or my late middle school I'm probably

443
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:10,230
playing playing Def Leppard on cassette

444
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,970
tape and if you don't know who Def

445
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:17,490
Leppard is it's the it's the greatest

446
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:18,959
seven-armed band on the planet so sorry

447
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:24,689
that was terrible and this could be on

448
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:31,830
video too good so so the way this one

449
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:34,309
works let me get it all typed out so you

450
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,309
guys can see

451
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,449
oh it's gotta work that's not beautiful

452
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,120
so um so this is kind of what it looked

453
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,850
like right this is this is exactly the

454
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,409
code that I was running back in high

455
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,600
school when I was doing my war dialing

456
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:58,030
it's running in a DOS emulator thanks to

457
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,500
emulators so actually when I first

458
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,820
looked up the image I'm like I bet I can

459
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,350
run this in an emulator that'd be really

460
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,820
cool and like five people here are gonna

461
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,909
thinks is really cool but I thought it

462
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,290
was cool so but you can you can see kind

463
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,910
of how it goes right like it just it

464
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,770
just you know is gonna keep dialing

465
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,750
numbers until it until it finds

466
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,790
computers and then it's gonna stack them

467
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,740
by you know well that was a busy one so

468
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,810
you know you could you could move back

469
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,400
around on it CDs would be carriers

470
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,580
detected which would be computers that

471
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,770
you found things like that and because

472
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,270
because this was written by nerds it's

473
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,770
got some funny features like if you hit

474
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,120
G it'll it'll mark it as a girl in case

475
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,379
a girl picked up the phone while you're

476
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,449
dialing I I assure you that there was

477
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:45,160
exactly zero relationships that started

478
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,680
this way zero exactly zero so so yeah so

479
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,000
that's kind of what that looked like

480
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,830
they eventually came out with there was

481
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,330
u.s. robotics modems after a while so

482
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,760
this got way more efficient because what

483
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,290
would happen is it can tell if a voice

484
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,690
picked up so if a voice picked up it

485
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,030
would hang up right away and start start

486
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,040
dialing other stuff but again this was

487
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,470
an arms race right like at first you

488
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,820
would do you know wait 30 seconds if you

489
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,400
didn't get it carrier you would move on

490
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,320
to the next and you could you could just

491
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,940
dial sequentially at first well then you

492
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,620
had to kind of randomize it because they

493
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,080
were getting savvy to it so if they saw

494
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,310
you you know dialing you know 1 2 3 4

495
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,199
they would shut you down pretty quick

496
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,950
then you would randomize it then you had

497
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,600
to randomize the timing again this is

498
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,590
gonna be super similar to the port

499
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,969
scanning stuff that we're gonna talk

500
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,220
about here in a second right the you

501
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,910
know a whole arms race where you know

502
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,220
the as the the attackers techniques get

503
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,870
better the defenders techniques kind of

504
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:48,000
rise at the same pace and kind of get

505
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:48,000
better along with them so oh yeah

506
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:14,649
it's that look okay yeah okay so yeah so

507
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,740
so foot scanning again back back in the

508
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,570
early days this is even before nmap I

509
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,970
know some people didn't remember a row

510
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,620
beforehand map but but there was there

511
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,060
was port scanners and it was kind of one

512
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,770
of the earliest kind of port scanners

513
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,110
was called strobe there were a few other

514
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,760
ones there I think the interesting thing

515
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,379
about this one that a lot of people

516
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,020
don't know is written by Julian Assange

517
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,520
who's the the WikiLeaks guy so he was he

518
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,050
was actually a super legit hacker back

519
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,540
in the day I don't want to say he's not

520
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,460
a legit hacker anymore but he did

521
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,310
apparently rub feces all over the walls

522
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,460
at his uh his that he kind of went crazy

523
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:51,220
a little bit so but but yeah so that was

524
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,740
his code again this was a super simple

525
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,990
port scanner there's no kind of ability

526
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,520
to do half-open scans or send scans or

527
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,890
any of that stuff there's no kind of

528
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,260
timing you know modifications to unless

529
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,260
you went into the code but what was nice

530
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,210
about this port scanner at the time

531
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:10,000
especially on high security networks is

532
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,610
it was basically a self-contained C file

533
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,350
and one of the one of the only ways you

534
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,510
would typically get caught on a high

535
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,189
security network back in the day was my

536
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,020
movement files back and forth right they

537
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,490
were there watching for that but what

538
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,889
you can do is you could take the C code

539
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,270
here you can basically get two terminals

540
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,100
up you could cut and paste it over to

541
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,330
the system and then compile it on the

542
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,159
other system and run it from there and

543
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,540
it ran fine and it was a really nice way

544
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,070
to kind of hop around whatever their

545
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,080
detection mechanisms were on things like

546
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,939
that that probably doesn't work that

547
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,080
well anymore but you know just just kind

548
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,960
of bring that up this again this is old

549
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,790
this this is exactly what inspired a few

550
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,450
doors who's the guy who wrote and mapped

551
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:52,178
a there was a group of

552
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,650
three of us at the time we had we had a

553
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:56,740
research group called basement research

554
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,780
but we had done some of the initial kind

555
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,790
of looks into kind of tcpi

556
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,790
fingerprinting which which which got

557
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:07,659
integrated later among a couple a couple

558
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:09,549
other things but but again you know so

559
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:13,900
nmap comes out you know you've got a

560
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:15,070
sophisticated scanner as in mapping and

561
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,100
you know port scanning became more

562
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,500
popular you know firewalls and stuff

563
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,270
started having better defenses so again

564
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,860
and map starts implementing all these

565
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,480
other features you know you can do you

566
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,100
know you can mess with your timing you

567
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,500
can mess with you know the type of scan

568
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,790
things like that to try and avoid

569
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,809
whatever defense mechanisms are out

570
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:36,399
there so again this was supposed to kill

571
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,570
hacking at the time right there they're

572
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,860
gonna be like no we're gonna come up

573
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,500
with a thing you can't poor it's key and

574
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,270
you really can't map as any of my sock

575
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,820
brethren will tell you that working a

576
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,809
sock currently people mostly don't care

577
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,909
if you port scan them anymore because

578
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:50,710
it's such a common thing so it's kind of

579
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,700
come back around now to where you know

580
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,350
you can pour it's gained just about

581
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,150
anything and yeah I promise you that

582
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,860
well I don't promise you don't go scan

583
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,540
the FBI they might come find you but you

584
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,439
know you can scan a lot of stuff and

585
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:07,290
they're not gonna they're not gonna

586
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:09,280
necessarily come come get you so DDoS

587
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,879
one of the first things I want to point

588
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:16,059
out is I do not consider DDoS hacking at

589
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,210
all it's the technical functional

590
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:20,620
equivalent of me calling a hundred pizza

591
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,350
guys and having them show up at your

592
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,820
door all at the same time but it's

593
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,830
somewhat effective right you know you

594
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,870
you get enough people who participate in

595
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,570
this and you can you know you can bring

596
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:34,030
down bring down networks some of the

597
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,129
some of the original companies the you

598
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,418
know got attacked kind of struggled with

599
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,570
this because there really wasn't any

600
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:42,160
kind of defenses in place at the time

601
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,530
now there's whole companies that

602
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,480
specialize in DDoS protection because

603
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,809
it's been become such a common kind of

604
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,549
thing I don't know if any of you were

605
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:53,549
around at the time this is going on

606
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,550
if you logged into the IRC Channel and

607
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,350
kind of read what was going on at this

608
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,720
time you would lose an IQ point

609
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,159
approximately every 30 minutes it was

610
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,760
some of the dumbest stuff you've ever

611
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,760
seen

612
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,120
I saw people like you know hey I found

613
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,940
their DNS server it's 127 dot zero dot

614
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,550
zero dot one and and there's literally

615
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,800
this whole crowd of people like yeah you

616
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,260
know you guys you're terrible hackers

617
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,190
but you know but you know they kind of

618
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,310
feel like they're part of something you

619
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,140
know so so again it's this pattern right

620
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,510
this pattern we keep talking about you

621
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,220
know hardly any defenses at first the

622
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,600
attackers get more sophisticated and

623
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,480
then every you know everything kind of

624
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,530
Rises at the at the same pace how am i

625
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,710
doing on top I'm doing pretty good

626
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,710
actually

627
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:47,600
so automation is one of the big ones I

628
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:51,530
want to talk about one of the big things

629
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,709
where I continually heard kind of about

630
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:57,500
the depth of hacking so at this time I

631
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,120
was probably working a lot of

632
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,890
professional services stuff so I used to

633
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,510
work for a couple of big accounting

634
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,820
firms for like a lot of my early career

635
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,190
and I would basically go around and hack

636
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,889
in probably every big company that you

637
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,630
could think of you know just that had

638
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,070
been hired by these accounting firms to

639
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:16,370
kind of come to pen testing and stuff

640
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:18,139
and I literally remember remember

641
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,030
sitting with someone one time and

642
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,980
they're showing the Internet security

643
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,420
scanner which is one of the first kind

644
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,370
of commercial you know braid

645
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,890
vulnerability scanners at the time and

646
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:30,889
he's like look Mike it's hacking and I'm

647
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:34,280
like it's kind of hacking I mean it's

648
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,480
you know so so the thing the thing one

649
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,960
of the things I want to talk about is

650
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,120
don't ever confuse automation with kind

651
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,210
of the end of what you're doing because

652
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,709
what's gonna happen is automation and

653
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,390
this is true with any hack that comes

654
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,660
out right like there's any exploit that

655
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,430
somebody comes up with if first is very

656
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,750
difficult to implement and then

657
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,490
somebody's gonna write some sort of

658
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,960
Metasploit module for it or something

659
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,550
like that and then it's become automated

660
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,470
then it becomes very easy to do right

661
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,540
you literally just go plug in a couple

662
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,140
of parameters kick it off and then that

663
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,360
exploit has been been

664
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,940
made it at that point but what I want us

665
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,719
to do is embrace automation because what

666
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,010
automation is automation is not killing

667
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,350
hacking or it's not killing things that

668
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,760
we do what it's doing is it's taking

669
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,830
pieces of what we do

670
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,570
automating those so that we can do it at

671
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,040
a wide scale so that we can move on and

672
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,330
do cooler things right because there's a

673
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,580
lot of cool things that we want to work

674
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,250
on as hackers there's lots of new

675
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,889
technology that comes out so so don't

676
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,540
ever think that you know automation

677
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:38,640
automation is kind of the killer of

678
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,810
things but but you know the war dialer

679
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,130
was kind of an early example of

680
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,470
automation you could even kind of look

681
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,060
at that then and be like okay this is

682
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,530
kind of automating functions

683
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,679
the thing I didn't mention when I was

684
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,470
talking about war dialers was again not

685
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,660
only could you dial during the day for

686
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,980
for other computers but again this was

687
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,960
back at the time when you had to pay for

688
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,750
a long distance so people had long

689
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,870
distance calling carts right so what you

690
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:06,600
can do is basically dial up the number

691
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,860
for you know for the longest where you

692
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,980
would put in your long-distance calling

693
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,330
card enter a random number if it got a

694
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,770
carrier on the other end it would know

695
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,379
you got a legit kind of long-distance

696
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,790
calling card number and they barely had

697
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,850
any monitoring for this stuff back in

698
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,350
the day so if you allegedly did

699
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,830
something like that during the day you

700
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,209
would come home and maybe have 20 or 30

701
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,439
other people's long-distance calling

702
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:32,250
card numbers that you could use to make

703
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,540
long-distance calls but again same type

704
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,220
of thing you know the the phone

705
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,670
companies eventually kind of got wise to

706
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:42,650
that and kind of shut that down ISS and

707
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:45,090
Expos and scanners of that you know that

708
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,670
same thing like it's automating the

709
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,020
process of mapping networks which is

710
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,730
something that hackers do it's

711
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,580
automating the process of looking for

712
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:56,040
vulnerabilities but what it what it's

713
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,689
it's not really killing what you need to

714
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,430
be doing is a hacker what it's doing is

715
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,380
automating some of the pieces that used

716
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,820
to be really painful and making those

717
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,860
simple so that you can spend more of

718
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,490
your time doing kind of the manual

719
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,840
techniques and things like that

720
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,420
same thing with web application security

721
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,689
scanners you know back in the day I

722
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,279
don't know if people

723
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,440
remember like the days before sequel map

724
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:21,039
trying to do like a sequel injection on

725
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,460
a website was super super painful oh my

726
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,730
god

727
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,809
you know it's you know you know now

728
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,730
we've got things like verbs that

729
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:29,320
automate a lot of that stuff we've got

730
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,330
programs like sequel map that automate a

731
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,370
lot of that stuff this makes our life

732
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,918
better this doesn't make this isn't like

733
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,928
taking something and being like oh well

734
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,620
that's that's not a thing anymore

735
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:43,120
again this is taking things and you know

736
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,658
make it making it easier so that we can

737
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,299
focus on cooler stuff so source code

738
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:51,340
scanning the same thing is been kind of

739
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:53,620
killing a lot of the typical exploits

740
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,000
that we would find were to talk about

741
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,850
exploits here in a second and kind of

742
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,240
what happened with those but again you

743
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:03,370
know it's it's it's allowing us to focus

744
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,870
on other things you know if the if the

745
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,879
source code is good and we were putting

746
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,469
out good programs then let's go out and

747
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,490
look at look at other places in the

748
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,289
organization where there might be

749
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:19,000
problems and kind of focus on those

750
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:20,710
right this this one really hurts my

751
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,679
heart you're gonna have to give me a

752
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,750
minute here so I I don't remember if

753
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,049
people remember way back in the day I'm

754
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:31,120
gonna say like in the 90s especially

755
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:33,460
there was there was really mailing lists

756
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,459
and things out there and so if somebody

757
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,460
came up with an exploit for something

758
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:41,350
you know typically they would even even

759
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,149
before responsible disclosure was a

760
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,009
thing you know they a lot of people

761
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:47,110
would typically be like look I had this

762
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:49,690
bug and this particular vendors product

763
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,479
I let the vendor know 30 days later they

764
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:55,870
would drop the exploit code and the the

765
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,580
thought at the time and I've I've

766
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,469
changed my thinking on this a little bit

767
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,210
since then and I'll explain why but the

768
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,220
thought at the time was it really levels

769
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,899
the playing field right the the bad guys

770
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,029
have the exploit code but the good guys

771
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:08,408
have the exploit code also so that you

772
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:10,299
can use that code to test your own

773
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:12,009
systems and find out if you're

774
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:16,000
vulnerable to this specific thing or not

775
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:18,850
right what ended up happening is people

776
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,759
would would automate this and they would

777
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:24,250
militarize it on a large scale so what

778
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,990
ended up happening is shortly after

779
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:29,000
someone would publish an exploit

780
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,980
someone would write some sort of scanner

781
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,110
that would look for it on a wide scale

782
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,370
and then they basically just bang across

783
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,010
the whole internet looking for whatever

784
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,989
this specific bug is and you getting

785
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:41,270
hacked at that point is not any

786
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,040
different than being a victim and like a

787
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,050
drive-by right you're literally just

788
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,670
happened to be on the internet with the

789
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:50,330
specific piece of software that has the

790
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:52,420
specific bug but what was nice at that

791
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:55,610
time especially if you're a protester is

792
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,650
you had access to a lot of good quality

793
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:00,350
exploit code without having to buy a

794
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,000
commercial tool or anything like that it

795
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,050
just tended to be freely available so

796
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,460
that was I don't want to say that was

797
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,960
the good old days of hacking I'm gonna

798
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,570
I'm gonna age myself again here a bit

799
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,640
but but it was you know it was nice

800
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,550
because you had you had access to really

801
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,310
good quality exploit code can anyone

802
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:18,139
here remember the last time that new

803
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:22,520
vulnerability came out and you had an

804
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:24,950
exploit within 90 days even I mean for

805
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,170
some simple stuff probably but but

806
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,260
what's kind of happened is there became

807
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,370
a market for exploit code and and

808
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,520
there's a couple reasons for that

809
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,959
the the companies founded valuable to

810
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,970
kind of know about this stuff before it

811
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,860
came out right so this is where some of

812
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,240
this bug bounty stuff comes and things

813
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,790
like that where you know people are

814
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,780
getting paid to develop exploits so they

815
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:48,560
don't want to give it away for free

816
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,690
right if you can if you can sell it the

817
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,179
other thing that happened is and this

818
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,580
this is still true if you were if you

819
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,500
have a zero-day X say I find a zero day

820
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,490
exploit and my iPhone if I did I would

821
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,050
be rich I wouldn't be here right now

822
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,330
let's be honest I mean those things go

823
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:05,210
for an incredible amount of money now

824
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:08,300
but you know if I have something like

825
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,820
that and I don't tell anyone about it I

826
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:13,430
basically have a skeleton key to get

827
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,590
into everybody's iPhone that nobody

828
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,450
knows about and nobody's got any kind of

829
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:19,669
protection mechanisms to protect against

830
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,200
right so this would be similar with any

831
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,000
kind of zero day that comes out right

832
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,640
like you get a zero day exploit that

833
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,340
comes out let's say it's Apache you

834
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,530
don't tell anyone about it well that

835
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,330
that's the skeleton key to get into that

836
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,310
Apache server

837
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,659
no one knows enough about it to develop

838
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,460
any protection mechanisms you know

839
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,020
there's no IDs there's no laughs in the

840
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,539
world that's gonna see what you're doing

841
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,090
because no one

842
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:44,720
all snows about it so then what happened

843
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:47,100
is these things got attractive to

844
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,909
government agencies and intelligence

845
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:54,600
agencies and things because you know we

846
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:56,159
you know I we there's you know the NSA

847
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,539
has huge groups of people

848
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,369
I think it's called tailored access

849
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:01,408
operations I think is what they call it

850
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:02,939
but you know people that literally their

851
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:05,190
job is to go break into other computers

852
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,779
you know from you know from an

853
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,820
intelligence standpoint and try and get

854
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:11,190
access to things so they find things

855
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,899
like that super valuable so what's kind

856
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,559
of happened is we've gotten into this

857
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:18,389
age now where when exploits come out

858
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:21,629
they may most likely be being developed

859
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:24,029
by by some sort of government agency not

860
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:26,119
only us you know the US has used

861
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:29,309
capabilities here but you know China has

862
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:30,928
incredible capabilities in this area you

863
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:32,580
know Russia's got really incredible

864
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:34,169
capabilities in this area and they have

865
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,809
just huge teams of people that are super

866
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:38,399
smart that can get paid a lot they have

867
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:40,408
you know kind of unlimited research

868
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,330
budgets to go do this stuff so a lot of

869
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:43,679
zero-days now kind of sit with people

870
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,519
that you probably wouldn't want to have

871
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,960
them you know unless unless you're a

872
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,369
terrorist or something I you know I

873
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,450
don't think you're probably a target I

874
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:53,999
don't I don't think they really care

875
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,979
about my you know my pub pictures or

876
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:57,720
anything like that probably but you know

877
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:59,820
it's it's kind of it's kind of where

878
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,989
things have gone is you know there's

879
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,720
just not this kind of availability of

880
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:09,540
exploit code anymore now interestingly

881
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,869
enough if you talk to red teamers this

882
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,250
day and you ask them like well in the

883
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:16,169
course of you know because then when I

884
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,929
define red teamer I'm saying you know

885
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:20,549
typically you know maybe like a Mandy

886
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:22,799
Anderson or a company like that where

887
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:24,629
they come in and they basically do two

888
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:27,290
things they they start off with an

889
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:30,149
assumed breach so they they basically

890
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:31,529
you know give us a workstation we're

891
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:32,638
gonna have access to we're gonna see how

892
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,119
much damage we can do in your

893
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,220
environment

894
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,379
and and I asked someone I'm like well

895
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,618
how much exploit code do you typically

896
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:43,469
use in the course of a day or a year and

897
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,690
he's like zero you're basically living

898
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,969
off the land anymore right on that stuff

899
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,470
so as kind of the availability of

900
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,839
exploit code went down they've kind of

901
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:54,549
ship

902
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,900
two different techniques yeah and

903
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,250
they're kind of assuming kind of an

904
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:01,240
internal kind of you know they've

905
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:04,380
already got access access to stuff so

906
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,379
[Music]

907
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,150
firewalls were another technology that

908
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,980
came out again it was supposed to kill

909
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,680
basically everything that we do as

910
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,350
hackers you know first it was just basic

911
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,850
Network firewalls quickly we learned

912
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,830
that you know you have to open the

913
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,750
firewall for some stuff and the some

914
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,980
stuff tends to be vulnerable so if you

915
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,360
can get into the some stuff you're

916
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,220
behind the firewall and then you can

917
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,890
kind of kind of weave your way around

918
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,740
and do damage there's next-gen firewalls

919
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:34,359
now like palos and things and then

920
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,930
there's web application firewalls that's

921
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,510
down a lot of some you know especially

922
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,470
sequel injection and things like that

923
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:45,280
the thing we'll talk about here in a

924
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:47,230
minute is you know you have to do your

925
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,210
testing sometimes assuming that controls

926
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:52,330
will fail you know there's there's all

927
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:54,310
the times where you know you have a Web

928
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,540
Application Firewall and you think it's

929
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,029
doing what it should be doing and

930
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,740
somebody comes out with some sort of

931
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,630
bypass or something or maybe the the

932
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,870
laughs is down you know something like

933
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,270
that

934
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,799
I really want to kind of encourage

935
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,770
people to start thinking about things

936
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,110
from kind of a deconstructed perspective

937
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,970
you know don't don't assume that if

938
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:16,300
you're hacking something and you didn't

939
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:18,129
get in that day that that should be the

940
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,120
end of kind of your exploits because you

941
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,000
know what you should really be thinking

942
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,710
of is here's kind of here's kind of my

943
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,260
application here's all the layers of

944
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,340
stuff that protect it and maybe I want

945
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,970
to go pick on the Web Application

946
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,740
Firewall specifically for awhile right

947
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:35,350
because because again you know controls

948
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,910
will fail and some especially like

949
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:39,190
network pentesting anymore has become

950
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:41,290
very situational right like if there

951
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:43,540
happens to be an exploit out that day

952
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:46,360
that works on a particular system that

953
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,890
you find and you catch them between when

954
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,740
the exploit came out and when they put

955
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:53,170
the patch down you know you're gonna

956
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,720
have a successful you know engagement

957
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:58,270
there unless you know you're somebody

958
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,799
like you know a trader sore someone

959
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,420
who's sitting on like this whole army of

960
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,420
people who reverse engineer in their

961
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,890
sleep and right

962
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,350
you know right zero days you know

963
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,270
constantly it's just not within a normal

964
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,970
pen testers capability typically to be

965
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:13,580
writing zero days on the fly so what I'm

966
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,230
saying is the fact that you know it's

967
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,730
kind of time-based so you need to be

968
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:19,430
able to kind of test like all of the

969
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,340
controls and an account for the fact

970
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:24,890
that maybe you know maybe there isn't an

971
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,630
exploit and an Apache that comes out you

972
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:31,879
know next month and then what happens to

973
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:34,130
you when that when that happens right an

974
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,810
end point protection this one kind of

975
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,100
cracked me up for a while I'm gonna I'm

976
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,250
gonna let Brandon talk about this one a

977
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,250
lot

978
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,279
this is again where I heard a lot that

979
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,560
this is gonna be the death of hacking

980
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,870
right you know we've got stuff on our

981
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,690
end point now you can't land malware on

982
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:52,759
there that's gonna work anymore you know

983
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,410
whitelisting was a big thing you know

984
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,840
we're basically you have a list of

985
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:59,629
allowed programs and because of that

986
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,460
your your malware is just absolutely not

987
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,400
gonna run on the end point we all know

988
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,540
especially uh people that work in

989
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,270
security operations centers that

990
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,680
typically nowadays you know people don't

991
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,810
come hack through the front door right

992
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,790
the the days of you know people haven't

993
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,190
really week perimeter defenses are kind

994
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:20,390
of gone for the most part there are some

995
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:22,250
examples but you know typically you know

996
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,299
it lands on your workstation somewhere

997
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,040
you know you've got you've got some

998
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,400
button clicker in your organization you

999
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,950
know you send them an email I actually

1000
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,320
decided that the security education and

1001
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,319
this front is completely useless

1002
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,930
I've seen it's true it's true

1003
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,460
I uh it has to be technical controls I

1004
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:43,970
don't care how many times you send

1005
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,590
people fake spam messages or you know

1006
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,689
you can do talks you can do all this

1007
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:49,370
other stuff my experience has been that

1008
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,770
no matter how much education you do with

1009
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,359
your users the the numbers stay roughly

1010
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,890
the same you know you can make them a

1011
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,190
little more savvy and I've seen some

1012
00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:00,950
cool stuff we're like you know it'll

1013
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,540
alert you know on things in your you

1014
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,910
know in Outlook to kind of you know help

1015
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,650
you make some better decisions but but

1016
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,299
you never you're never going to get that

1017
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:10,730
number down to zero and you have to get

1018
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,140
that number down to zero because it just

1019
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,850
takes one person right you just need one

1020
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,220
person to click on a link and all of a

1021
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,868
sudden somebody's landed on your and

1022
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,209
network and they're running they're

1023
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:21,609
running all over the place any of my big

1024
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,500
any of my big sock operations will tell

1025
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,450
you that this is still a constant battle

1026
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,530
right no matter how good their and we're

1027
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,848
talking about really really big

1028
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,840
companies that have all the money in the

1029
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,690
world to spend on protection

1030
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,310
capabilities and they still it still

1031
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:36,369
ends up landing on the workstation and

1032
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,200
and you've got problems so similar to

1033
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:39,880
obeying you know and this is what I tell

1034
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,040
people all the time you can't have

1035
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,960
perfect security ever right you can have

1036
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,119
pretty good security that's going to

1037
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,290
keep out most people and then what you

1038
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:49,090
need is really good monitoring

1039
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,910
capabilities to kind of detect when

1040
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:53,650
things go wrong so that would be the the

1041
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,930
bank alarm that goes off and hopefully

1042
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,880
what happens is the police show up in

1043
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,799
time to catch the robber which is what

1044
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,970
we want out of our out of our security

1045
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:08,770
operations right so man I'm gonna hit

1046
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:12,220
this right on time on that on that front

1047
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:15,160
just to talk talk a little bit this was

1048
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,810
kind of the arms race again right so you

1049
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,009
know originally it was really easy to

1050
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:22,420
kind of land malware on a workstation as

1051
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:24,130
endpoint protection improved there was

1052
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,140
kind of these things that came up to

1053
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:30,280
basically like obfuscate your malware

1054
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:32,290
code I will tell you that running Python

1055
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,180
through veil is still like magic pretty

1056
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,369
much for the most part it gets by a lot

1057
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,470
of stuff but you know there's you know

1058
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:42,790
there's a you know ms/ms a venom there's

1059
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:45,040
a you know veil and then lo P a lot a

1060
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,570
lot of people know lo P here he was he's

1061
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,220
a local guy that's out in Denver now

1062
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,960
when one of my favorite people but he

1063
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,430
wrote he wrote Great Scott which is

1064
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,080
basically a tool to kind of help you get

1065
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,460
around whitelisting it'll kind of buzz

1066
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,970
through stuff until it finds things that

1067
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,810
works and things like that and then

1068
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:01,899
Metasploit actually just come out with a

1069
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:04,390
new evasion module so you know these

1070
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,950
these things again it's an arms race but

1071
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,990
this is this has been an imperfect

1072
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,060
science you know no matter no matter how

1073
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,560
did this this stuff is that this that

1074
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:15,640
comes out no matter how good kind of

1075
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:18,549
obfuscation techniques are people still

1076
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,440
find a way to make things work and and

1077
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,870
they do this in mass it's it's pretty

1078
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,400
crazy you know

1079
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:26,100
they have this all all kind of

1080
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,340
militarized and make it make it work at

1081
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,380
scale so a lot of a lot of these botnets

1082
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,120
and things and things that exist now it

1083
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,950
exists because of this kind of

1084
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:42,359
deficiency and this ability to kind of

1085
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:44,790
detect things like this improve

1086
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,760
programming frameworks so this this is

1087
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:50,820
kind of the other thing that goes on is

1088
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:54,510
as time goes on programming frameworks

1089
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,880
are making it harder to be a bad

1090
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:59,280
developer at least a bad developer from

1091
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,340
a security perspective I've always been

1092
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,990
really surprised because you look at

1093
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,000
things from a hackers perspective for so

1094
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:08,459
long and then when you talk to

1095
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,960
developers they have very different

1096
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,130
considerations and I think that's one of

1097
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,140
the things we all need to think about

1098
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:16,290
sometimes right is they need to get

1099
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:19,170
things working they need the users to be

1100
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:20,970
happy with the code but a lot of times

1101
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,710
security is kind of a secondary

1102
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,290
consideration to what they have going on

1103
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:27,240
right so traditionally you know it was

1104
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,460
it was not uncommon for me like to test

1105
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,859
a web application and find a cross-site

1106
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,570
scripting and then go talk to the

1107
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,160
developer and they hadn't ever heard of

1108
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,810
cross-site scripting you know so they

1109
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,549
they just they don't a lot of times I

1110
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:43,020
just don't think you know like a hacker

1111
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:44,280
does so but what's happened is let you

1112
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,100
know languages have improved

1113
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,780
you know Python is you know super

1114
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,660
popular kind of you know scripting type

1115
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,730
language now but you know it kills a lot

1116
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,870
of stuff like you know buffer overflows

1117
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,490
and things like that that used to were

1118
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,799
to work on something like a C language

1119
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,209
or something like that and then you know

1120
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,670
programming frameworks have gotten a lot

1121
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:05,100
smarter and kind of force you down the

1122
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:07,170
right path right so it's much it's

1123
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,380
becoming much harder if you implement

1124
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,790
you know programming frameworks properly

1125
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,460
you know to do the wrong thing in your

1126
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:21,300
code so so again you know this is this

1127
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:23,940
is improve things the yeah so why why

1128
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,110
can't you kill hacking which is kind of

1129
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,150
where we're trying to get to here right

1130
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:29,760
why why why all this stuff that keeps

1131
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:32,220
coming up and hacking is still super

1132
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,360
prevalent and we still seem to be able

1133
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,470
to do what we want from the

1134
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:39,480
most part on systems and things well the

1135
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,080
first thing is is it the people problem

1136
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,300
right people people are button clickers

1137
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,160
you know again you know talking about

1138
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,680
the fishing thing you know you can't you

1139
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,450
cannot do enough education to where

1140
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,359
you're gonna have someone that doesn't

1141
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,410
get some email and and they're going to

1142
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,090
click on it and they're in the work

1143
00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:00,089
station is gonna be owned

1144
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:02,520
so social engineering just in general is

1145
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:04,850
tends to be a really big problem I would

1146
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,680
say over the course of my career

1147
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:11,040
probably have broken into about half as

1148
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,470
many systems through social engineering

1149
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,210
as I have through technical means and I

1150
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:17,310
think that lines up with a lot of other

1151
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,720
people who have worked in this space I

1152
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:20,910
know I know kevin Mitnick was real

1153
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,520
famous for you know for kind of being a

1154
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:26,069
really good social engineer but you know

1155
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,840
I looked like I'm a nice guy you know I

1156
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,640
stroll up you know I kind of chitchat

1157
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,650
with the you know the person guard in

1158
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,940
the lobby and next thing you know I'm

1159
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,410
kind of in the building

1160
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,760
you know plugged in in a conference room

1161
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,710
and the defense is looking much

1162
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,640
different from that perspective than

1163
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,610
they do when you're trying to hit them

1164
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,830
from the internet I always tell people I

1165
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,600
think that's a super unlikely attack I

1166
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,880
said you know the reason that I'm good

1167
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,140
at it is because I have a letter in my

1168
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,760
pocket that says you're not going to

1169
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,049
take me to jail if you catch me because

1170
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,090
I'm they're supposed to be doing it on

1171
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,620
purpose and it's really hard to put a

1172
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,960
nerd in a suit sometimes and make them

1173
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,720
look like like they're supposed to be

1174
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,400
there so I got complete a suit on and

1175
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,970
look look reasonably like I'm supposed

1176
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,350
to be there so but but yes social

1177
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,540
engineering is not going away you know

1178
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,700
calling people up talking talking them

1179
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,350
out of stuff over the phone you know

1180
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,200
fishing all these types of things are

1181
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:20,460
not going away so and have always been a

1182
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,529
problem again developers don't think

1183
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,870
like hackers right

1184
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,330
so so kind of forcing them down a path

1185
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:29,790
to you know to do better stuff you know

1186
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,410
source code review having these

1187
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,880
frameworks that kind of continually

1188
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,710
review source code as they're doing

1189
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,590
development and things help help kind of

1190
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:40,950
that problem a lot but I especially

1191
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:42,600
noticed this in newer thing so one of

1192
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,919
the things I noticed about my robot when

1193
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,120
I first propped him up is I started

1194
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,730
digging in on the code it was

1195
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:51,870
terrible it's literally terrible and I'm

1196
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:55,440
like but again this is new technology so

1197
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:58,359
you know old problems resurfacing right

1198
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,760
you know you you get established

1199
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:04,000
technology they work the kinks out for a

1200
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,550
while you know the problems tend to go

1201
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,380
away and then they implement some new

1202
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:11,470
feature and all of a sudden some 20 year

1203
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,240
old bug is back in the product or you

1204
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:16,600
know maybe it's just new technology you

1205
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,520
know you know Internet of Things or you

1206
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,130
know your Smart TV you know all of these

1207
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,410
types of things again are a lot of times

1208
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,810
developed without really thinking about

1209
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:27,009
the security implications of them so one

1210
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:30,880
of the things I would encourage you to

1211
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:31,960
do is to always really really be

1212
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,760
thinking about kind of what the next

1213
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:38,440
thing is right so don't don't don't kind

1214
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,540
of if you become a really good network

1215
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,250
pen tester don't know it's it and think

1216
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,200
I've developed a really good network pen

1217
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,660
testing skills you should be thinking

1218
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,520
about you know developing you know some

1219
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,830
some web application hacking skills or

1220
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,840
some highly encourage people to develop

1221
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:55,330
some reversing skills these days because

1222
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,310
a lot of a lot of hardware hacking kind

1223
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,259
of requires some of that but you know

1224
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,210
don't don't don't kind of don't kind of

1225
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,170
sit around you know continually be kind

1226
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,970
of thinking about the next thing to

1227
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,560
study I have always just kind of gone

1228
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:07,359
out and studied what I think is

1229
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,360
interesting and that's never really

1230
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,980
failed me it's actually always been kind

1231
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,350
of kind of interesting to see like I'll

1232
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,030
be studying some particular technology

1233
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,259
and like a week later comes up on some

1234
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,510
hack that I'm doing or something like

1235
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,990
that so you know I really encourage you

1236
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:24,700
just to kind of you know you know let's

1237
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:25,990
just study what you find interesting you

1238
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,879
know we all do this because we love it

1239
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,049
and that that's part of that's part of

1240
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,910
why we're good at this stuff right is

1241
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,710
because you know we don't we don't see

1242
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:34,810
this as pain but there there are people

1243
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,490
out there who literally like kind of

1244
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,690
kind of find things and just kind of sit

1245
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,100
on them and then they're like okay I'm

1246
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,270
good at this and you can't you can't do

1247
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,009
that in this field because things are

1248
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:44,080
moving too quickly the targets are

1249
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,760
moving they keep moving our cheese so to

1250
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,990
speak right you know they move the

1251
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,010
cheese from one side of the maze to the

1252
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,109
other and if you're sitting over here

1253
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,070
waiting on them to drop cheese again

1254
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:55,640
you're not going to find it you know you

1255
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:58,439
got it you got to be be be kind of agile

1256
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:02,189
new technologies are coming out quicker

1257
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:06,239
than then defenses right and traditional

1258
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:07,859
things so as much as sometimes it seems

1259
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,169
like things that I used to hack that

1260
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:12,299
were fun to hack or not hackable anymore

1261
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:14,189
and I say that with reservation because

1262
00:48:12,299 --> 00:48:17,939
everything's hackable from some you know

1263
00:48:14,189 --> 00:48:19,229
from some standpoint but you know

1264
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:22,890
there's all this new stuff that's

1265
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:25,468
continually coming out so the growth the

1266
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:29,009
growth of things you know they're new is

1267
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:30,150
for sure outpacing the the pace of

1268
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:33,479
things that are getting buttoned up

1269
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:35,999
properly so and then defenses are always

1270
00:48:33,479 --> 00:48:38,999
imperfect right so so again think of

1271
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:40,919
think of think of things from a controls

1272
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,169
perspective you know don't don't go out

1273
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:44,969
and maybe bang on the front door of your

1274
00:48:43,169 --> 00:48:47,429
internet connection and think things are

1275
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:48,929
okay kind of deconstruct that internet

1276
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:50,189
connection and be like well I'm gonna go

1277
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:52,169
pick on the web server for a little

1278
00:48:50,189 --> 00:48:53,759
while in the absence of the laughs you

1279
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:55,408
know and see how that looks so I'm gonna

1280
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:58,140
go pick on the firewall or I'm gonna

1281
00:48:55,409 --> 00:49:00,419
pick on the intrusion detection system I

1282
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,089
think you'll be amazed if you kind of

1283
00:49:00,419 --> 00:49:05,400
take that approach to things sometimes

1284
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:07,078
how much how many controls that you

1285
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,849
thought were operating properly or not

1286
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,289
operating like you would expect you know

1287
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:11,999
you're gonna find gaps there I guarantee

1288
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:14,880
you and it's just because there's kind

1289
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:16,229
of this tendency to you know you put a

1290
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,489
firewall up and you're like okay the

1291
00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:21,589
firewall is good and then you never

1292
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:21,589
really loop back around and retest it so

1293
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:28,079
and then you know kind of kind of

1294
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:32,669
expanding your influence this would this

1295
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:34,919
would be for a lot of people you know

1296
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:37,979
well and and first of all before I get

1297
00:49:34,919 --> 00:49:39,390
there you know III don't want people to

1298
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:41,129
think that you know to be a good hacker

1299
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:44,158
to be a good insecurity you know you

1300
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:46,169
have to have started in in sixth grade

1301
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:48,150
you know and have been doing this a long

1302
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:52,288
time some of some of the people that I'm

1303
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:55,019
most most proud of you know started kind

1304
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:57,179
of later in life Sean who's who's one of

1305
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:58,890
my favorite people on the planet you

1306
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:00,359
know was it a talk of mine and decided

1307
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:03,269
he wanted to get into this he just got a

1308
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:04,380
black badge at derbycon you know super

1309
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:06,479
super proud of that guy

1310
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,039
Aaron Miller which is one of the guys

1311
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:09,598
that I originally started with when we

1312
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,269
did the basement research stuff was a

1313
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,950
was a lawyer or an accountant by trade

1314
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:16,890
and just like a Linux hobbyist and just

1315
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:18,450
decided pick security up so it literally

1316
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:21,960
anyone can pick I don't say anyone can

1317
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:23,308
pick this up up you know but you know if

1318
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,460
you're interested in it you have the

1319
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:27,660
drive there's there's a ton of you know

1320
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,489
need in this space right now there's a

1321
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,749
ton of jobs out there and you can kind

1322
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:35,160
of take your pick of things that that

1323
00:50:30,749 --> 00:50:38,220
you want to work on I definitely want to

1324
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,839
encourage you to I'm gonna hits us right

1325
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,868
on time this is great

1326
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:45,269
embrace embrace automation so don't

1327
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:46,799
don't think of automation is as evil

1328
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:50,069
think of automation is the thing that's

1329
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:55,170
kind of helping helping your job helping

1330
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:57,359
automate the detection of things in a

1331
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:59,369
quicker manner to enable you to move on

1332
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,630
to cooler stuff I want you to think of

1333
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:03,089
that think of it like that don't ever

1334
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,349
think of automation as oh my god this I

1335
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:06,299
came up with this really cool hack

1336
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:07,769
someone wrote a Metasploit model for it

1337
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:09,210
now everybody can do it you shouldn't

1338
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:11,988
think of it like that this is what

1339
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:14,910
enables you to move on to cooler things

1340
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:17,369
I think think of hacking as a skill that

1341
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:21,239
can be broadly applied maybe maybe your

1342
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:23,549
job is not necessarily a a hacker but I

1343
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:25,440
think thinking about things from a

1344
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:26,969
hackers perspective it can be valuable

1345
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,719
to just about anyone's job

1346
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:32,430
I recently transitioned to I'm not

1347
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,019
working specifically in InfoSec I'm

1348
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,578
working on some internal cloud things

1349
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:38,069
and software-defined networking things

1350
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:39,869
and what I found is my hacking

1351
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:41,849
backgrounds super valuable in that space

1352
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:44,099
because you know again it's it's Linux

1353
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:47,719
containers again what's old is new we're

1354
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:47,719
back we're back to Linux again you know

1355
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:52,319
you know understanding firewalling and

1356
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:54,390
things like that all super important in

1357
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,430
that space so so think think of hacking

1358
00:51:54,390 --> 00:52:01,308
as a skill that you can kind of broadly

1359
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:04,319
apply to your job and and other things

1360
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:05,789
attack emulation is kind of something

1361
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,920
cool that's kind of been coming up

1362
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,359
lately but a lot of people is they're

1363
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,609
developing these controls frameworks

1364
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,819
especially like like miter attack and

1365
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:17,308
things like that having the ability to

1366
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:20,279
automate attacks and be able to do them

1367
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:22,109
at scale and repetitively so again so

1368
00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:24,799
that you can go test individual controls

1369
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:27,089
and things is super valuable so again

1370
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:29,369
kind of having an attacker mindset and

1371
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:31,979
that spaces is really valuable because

1372
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:34,769
you can basically take things that you

1373
00:52:31,979 --> 00:52:36,479
do on a day to day basis use them in an

1374
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:38,698
applied framework and then use that to

1375
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:40,049
kind of broadly test lots of things it

1376
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:42,119
really kind of gives you the ability

1377
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:45,089
instead of like I'm gonna go look at

1378
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:46,829
this today you can you know hit it all

1379
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:51,269
all over the place and kind of you know

1380
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:52,890
kind of apply that on a lot of things an

1381
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:54,299
incident response is somewhere where you

1382
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:58,169
can plug in in your organization if

1383
00:52:54,299 --> 00:53:00,869
you're like on the pen test team I I'm

1384
00:52:58,169 --> 00:53:03,479
always shocked when I see C socks that

1385
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:06,029
don't rope in the hackers when something

1386
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:08,339
big happens because I find that the

1387
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:09,689
hackers especially your internal hackers

1388
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:12,509
that have kind of been engaged to be

1389
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:14,189
continually testing your defenses have

1390
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:16,859
some really good ideas when a real hat

1391
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:18,419
goes down as far as like oh well I think

1392
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:20,729
maybe they're trying to do this because

1393
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:23,279
I know this is over here or they're

1394
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:24,538
trying this technique or you know it's

1395
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:26,969
really good to kind of plug those guys

1396
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:28,589
in there so if you're an internal pen

1397
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:30,359
tester and you're not involved with your

1398
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:31,859
sock I would encourage you to to get

1399
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,719
involved with your sock if you can as a

1400
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:35,669
way to kind of expand your influence and

1401
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:38,729
kind of kind of functions at your at

1402
00:53:35,669 --> 00:53:41,009
your company their vulnerability

1403
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:45,149
validation is a really interesting one

1404
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:46,650
too I'm getting the the Aaron's gonna

1405
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:48,779
come tackle me here in one minute so

1406
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:52,859
yeah but he's got a long way to run so

1407
00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:54,479
yeah I have a vulnerability validation

1408
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:55,859
as part of you know vulnerability

1409
00:53:54,479 --> 00:53:57,779
management is a good one to plug in to

1410
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:59,130
kind of kind of doing proof of concept

1411
00:53:57,779 --> 00:54:03,299
things on vulnerabilities to show if

1412
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:04,769
they work or not secure design physical

1413
00:54:03,299 --> 00:54:08,130
security and social engineering like we

1414
00:54:04,769 --> 00:54:09,749
talked about already and then again you

1415
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:11,130
know focus on new technologies as they

1416
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:13,408
come out because those are gonna kind of

1417
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:15,569
be the new thing Charlie Miller's a

1418
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:17,039
famous local guy he's the guy that's the

1419
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:19,799
the jeep hacker but everybody's heard

1420
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,689
about he was famous for kind of you know

1421
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:24,179
he was originally like famous for

1422
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:25,339
breaking in a max and then he would go

1423
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:26,809
out to this pond on come

1424
00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:28,549
in every year and they and him and his

1425
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:30,499
buddy wouldn't run over the max and then

1426
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:32,329
then he was the iPhone hacker you know

1427
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:33,919
so he's been really good about doing

1428
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:35,809
what I'm talking about which is you know

1429
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,739
don't don't sit in one spot you know he

1430
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:38,690
kind of figured out what the next thing

1431
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:41,749
was and so now he's you know he's kind

1432
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:43,190
of the famous car hacker guy so so yeah

1433
00:54:41,749 --> 00:54:44,868
you know just kind of move on to things

1434
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:46,549
you know move on to new technologies and

1435
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:48,890
kind of kind of study what uh what

1436
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:51,079
you're passionate about so and that is

1437
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:54,279
the end according to the sign right at

1438
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,279
the back thing thank you everyone
