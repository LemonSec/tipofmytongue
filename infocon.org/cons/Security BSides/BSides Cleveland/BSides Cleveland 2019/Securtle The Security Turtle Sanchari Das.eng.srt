1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
yeah well that was fun wasn't it hello

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,200
everybody my name is Joshua strife I'm

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,780
from Indiana University I run the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,490
internet-of-things house I work for the

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,219
security and privacy group and

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,779
informatics computing and engineering we

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:23,180
are a seven professor group with a slew

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:27,740
of PhDs maskers undergraduate students

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:30,560
and I also do educational outreach to

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,850
seventh grade through 12th grade as well

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,510
what I'm going to show you today is the

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,940
security turtle and if it looks really

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,949
really cute and simple it's actually

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,339
based out of some stuff that's not so

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,170
simple but it is really cute and I'm

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,570
gonna give you some my some background

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,550
on where we ended up with this and why

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,960
we ended up where we are so you're gonna

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,019
see quite a few different things as we

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,850
go forward okay and if anybody has any

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,730
questions as we're going please just

22
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,989
raise your hand whatever you want let me

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,960
know and I'd be happy to answer your

24
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:11,610
questions all right so every day all of

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,899
us move around in a world of invisible

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,810
risk

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,590
we can't smell it we can't see it we

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,049
can't touch it yet it's there now it's

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,070
not unique to cybersecurity there are

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,979
other fields where there are things

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:31,949
places where there's invisible

32
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:33,600
untestable untestable risk right we

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,340
worked in a nuclear power plant we'd

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,259
have this problem but users workers have

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,450
ways in which they measure risk so they

36
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,079
can decide where they're going to be in

37
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,820
what they're going to be doing right

38
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,139
like a dose meter notice I went

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,029
old-school on this I could have gone

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,829
something much newer but this makes my

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,490
old school happy okay

42
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,490
and with

43
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:07,050
users are able to measure that risk and

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:12,209
make mitigation choices accordingly the

45
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:16,050
problem is our users and all of us have

46
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:19,100
risk every day you know we do digital

47
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,420
stuff at the coffee shop all the time

48
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,390
grandma's checking her bank account at

49
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,549
Starbucks there's potential risk there

50
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,140
she can't taste whether it's a risk ya

51
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,730
can't smell it she can't see it because

52
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,958
she doesn't have any way to measure that

53
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:39,988
right so she just takes something

54
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:44,580
happens in our homes happens in our

55
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:49,530
board meetings and be Frank happens in

56
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:52,769
her children's bedrooms okay the risk is

57
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,780
there great or small we don't know we

58
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,140
move about our days completely oblivious

59
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,360
of what the level of risk we're at now

60
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,809
many of you here are probably in the

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,209
risk defense system you have IDs systems

62
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,000
you know how to run snood and all sorts

63
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:13,220
of fun stuff but I'm not sure how much

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,220
that's gonna help grandma at Starbucks

65
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,810
so what we tell users what's our

66
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,209
standard advice for users

67
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,100
we've made some successes over the years

68
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,220
on what we tell users to do and they do

69
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,070
it and they remember it they remember

70
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,780
that wi-fi's have to be locked down they

71
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,060
know there need to be passwords on

72
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,650
routers they get that now whoever

73
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,090
remembers the old days where nobody was

74
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,590
doing it you could drive through streets

75
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,200
and pick up all sorts of Wi-Fi is

76
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,170
everybody's locking down their Wi-Fi now

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,570
that's a success story we tell people to

78
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,238
run an anti-virus to run the malware

79
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,340
program on your laptop many of us go to

80
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,310
universities or in businesses or

81
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,720
industries where that's required it's

82
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,430
not on your laptop you're not going to

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,380
have your laptop there that's good we've

84
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,769
also been working really really hard on

85
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,239
phishing right everybody here has

86
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,040
probably been through some kind of a

87
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,470
phishing training or runs a phishing

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,429
training or has to measure how well

89
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,418
phishing training is working we're

90
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:20,168
making some progress in this area but

91
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:21,668
success has limits and the risks are

92
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:25,870
much greater than the places we've had

93
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:27,698
successes so not all the routers are in

94
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,710
the homes where users have control over

95
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,530
them they meet up with routers all day

96
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,239
long that aren't theirs we have trust

97
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:38,280
that these routers are protected or

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,560
locked or safe but we don't know we have

99
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,659
devices that are wandering all day long

100
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,500
having communications with all sorts of

101
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,900
different places we have Bluetooth which

102
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,550
is now a major vector it's a major issue

103
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,859
especially if you take Bluetooth Low

104
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,380
Energy into effect which we all have all

105
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,970
sorts of devices on us they're giving

106
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,800
out all sorts of information or

107
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,630
collecting up informations we want to

108
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,180
and all of these things are happening

109
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,340
all day long and some of them are you

110
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:12,280
know some small amount of them are risks

111
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:15,369
and the user has no idea and it's

112
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,559
because we're connecting to the internet

113
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,909
or we're interconnecting not necessarily

114
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,760
with the internet but with all sorts of

115
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:25,320
different things all through our lives

116
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:28,539
this is the IOT this is our new world so

117
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,430
what's the problem with this well part

118
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,860
of the problem is we have social

119
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,979
contracts we have constructs of privacy

120
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,960
we have understanding of what's

121
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,270
protected what's public what's private

122
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,520
and we've done a really good job about

123
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,409
that as a society but those

124
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,419
understandings don't hold up to our

125
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:50,639
technology anymore I'll give you an

126
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:52,990
example who here has ever used Kroger

127
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,949
okay I don't know if this is a regional

128
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,940
thing I would be careful with this

129
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,320
Kroger any grocery store when you go to

130
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,599
Kroger and you buy something you're

131
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,830
gonna use your discount card and very

132
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,889
likely you're gonna use your credit card

133
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:09,370
now raise your hand if you think this is

134
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:13,180
a truly private transaction of course

135
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:15,220
it's not and we know that right there's

136
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,130
a database connected to this there's a

137
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,469
database connected to that and if

138
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,229
subpoenas roll down informations coming

139
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:26,230
because these are not a truly private

140
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,870
transaction okay great and people

141
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:33,300
that people understand that what's the

142
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:37,660
universal form of purchasing privately

143
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,340
cash our buddy cash walk in that store

144
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,270
boom do you use your do you use your

145
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,070
Kroger Plus part no no you don't use

146
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,380
your Kroger Plus card or you ask for a

147
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,450
new Kroger Plus card right and that

148
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,980
keeps it transaction private as long as

149
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,920
you never use that second Kroger Plus

150
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,570
card again great and this isn't

151
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,820
understanding of privacy that we have

152
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:04,780
except for there's a problem with it the

153
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:08,140
problem is that credit card machine is

154
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,599
at a fixed location that I know it's

155
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,849
right here when you're doing your

156
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,680
transaction right and you stand right

157
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:18,880
next to it whether you're using cash or

158
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,640
credit card you're right there boom if

159
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,070
I'm Kroger or I'm anybody else what's to

160
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,000
keep me from taking a blue tooth box and

161
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,710
a Wi-Fi box shielding it really heavy so

162
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,520
that only has about a foot-and-a-half

163
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:36,099
range and every time I run a transaction

164
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,130
I just do a quick scan of what's in the

165
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,200
one foot area and I already picked you

166
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,830
up with Kroger plus card and credit card

167
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:47,590
20 times go ahead and use your cash I

168
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,530
already know who you are and I'll still

169
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,140
attach it to my database because these

170
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,000
things whether you're a Fitbit whether

171
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,729
your phone all of these things are

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,700
identifiers this is what people don't

173
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:03,190
understand this is the new edge of

174
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,550
technology meeting privacy and our old

175
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:10,030
social constructs are gone people have a

176
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,090
feeling of this threat they have it when

177
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:16,179
we have breaches when people find out

178
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,409
that your teddy bears could spy on you

179
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,610
by the way I'll show you that in a

180
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,230
minute when you can use toy unicorns to

181
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,370
track where children are and communicate

182
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:29,110
with them when I can take over the

183
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,510
entire lighting system of your house

184
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,510
through your crockpot

185
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,849
okay or worse than that a later team not

186
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,020
my team found out that I can attach the

187
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,370
crockpot and if you're attached to

188
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,699
crocked right at the same time I can

189
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,870
steal the

190
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:47,820
pictures off your phone okay people hear

191
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,820
about these and what do they think ah

192
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:54,400
this new world we live in

193
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,920
I'll just turn off my phone okay but the

194
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,329
reality is we can't do this this is the

195
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,949
world we live in this is the world our

196
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,140
users live in there's no removing

197
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,120
yourself from it you can't say I won't

198
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,040
buy an IOT fridge because in five years

199
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,040
all fridges will be IOT there's just not

200
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,230
going to be an option so what is it our

201
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,810
users need

202
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,430
well they need some education and they

203
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,680
need some education frankly that doesn't

204
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,120
necessarily come from engineers because

205
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,800
the indication that comes from engineers

206
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,950
is typically a text wall nobody's gonna

207
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,849
read it anyways right the education that

208
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:32,290
they can understand and they need some

209
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:34,600
basic directions we don't go into great

210
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,270
detail about the decision-making process

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,370
that goes into who gets to go when at a

212
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,079
stoplight and what the exact timings are

213
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,920
on things we just give people green

214
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:49,300
yellow red and it works really well so

215
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,640
why does this work this works because we

216
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,770
have mental models that are simple and

217
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,439
that affect us at an emotional level

218
00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:00,010
that we can remember now these are

219
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,210
tricky some are related to age for

220
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,730
instance we've done studies where we

221
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,470
found that over the age of 60 a mental

222
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,110
model related to space is what people

223
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:11,110
understand whereas if you're 45 and

224
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,810
under it's totally dirt and disease okay

225
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,010
and if we speak to those in our

226
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,380
education we have an impact and those

227
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:25,030
impacts lead to a change in actions and

228
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:27,670
let me give you an example so one of the

229
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,650
problem any people here have ever been

230
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,110
instructed for the love of God don't

231
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,819
pick up a USB Drive in the parking lot

232
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,440
and take it and put it into the server

233
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,330
raise your hand if that's been an

234
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,320
instruction set now raise your hand

235
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:46,330
again if you've done it yeah nobody's

236
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,880
not fast to it right but a user doing

237
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:51,010
that's a serious problem and so we

238
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,860
worked with the question how do you

239
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,960
impress upon users so that they

240
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,260
member not to do it again and I'm gonna

241
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,820
give you an example this is our mental

242
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,100
model video this was used with an

243
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,490
industry partner they used this video

244
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,130
and six months later everybody still

245
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:15,420
remembers this video video ready can you

246
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:18,900
see it okay here we go very short and I

247
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:32,640
have to get permission sorry how

248
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:36,120
embarrassing this video is really

249
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,800
memorable okay because we wouldn't just

250
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,300
pick up candy and shove it in our mouth

251
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,589
if it was dirty on the ground most of us

252
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,750
wouldn't at least so we work with things

253
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,070
like this give you another example which

254
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:52,820
I'll probably have to give permission to

255
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,820
as well sorry about this but this one

256
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:04,910
it's about passwords

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,910
[Music]

258
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,190
maybe single-use passwords or maybe

259
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,890
using your passwords across multiple

260
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:24,090
things is a really bad idea so it makes

261
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:26,550
sense okay so let's talk about a case

262
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,900
example in front of me I've got a cloud

263
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,150
pet unicorn there's another one over

264
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,069
there clap had also made kitty cats and

265
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,199
the cloud pet unicorn is a simple

266
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,210
child's toy it's actually a really good

267
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,550
idea when mommy or daddy have to go

268
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,400
overseas and faraway this toy becomes

269
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:44,219
the point of contact children record to

270
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,920
this its heart light goes on it sends a

271
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,810
message they send it back over the phone

272
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,709
it comes back down to the toy the heart

273
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,900
blinks blammo we have our opportunity to

274
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,720
listen to what mommy says and it gives

275
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:03,660
them a great way to talk via this stuff

276
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:05,660
cute toy it's cheap toy it relies on

277
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,209
Bluetooth Low Energy

278
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,550
you shook your head no okay you know

279
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,900
it's coming here and it's one of the few

280
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,640
toys in the world to actually been

281
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,350
removed from Amazon and eBay

282
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,880
due to the failures i'm about to show

283
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,410
you so it runs off Bluetooth Low Energy

284
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,620
if you don't know Bluetooth Low Energy

285
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,209
it's a pretty simple protocol and it's

286
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,900
what we use for our Fitbit so the things

287
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:33,410
that runs batteries for a long time

288
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:36,720
broadcaster roughly 30 40 feet depending

289
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:39,480
single device single central can speak

290
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,120
to a single one of these toys at a time

291
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,400
so the toy broadcasts constantly and

292
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,590
when I link to it it ceases to broadcast

293
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,760
and I can interact with that well one of

294
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,990
the problems with Bluetooth Low Energy

295
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:56,130
is in the badly done implementation it

296
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,530
has no security and we'll take just a

297
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:02,820
second here and I will give you a live

298
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:07,199
demonstration of the problem so this is

299
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:11,220
a simple set of JavaScript and what this

300
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:17,340
allows me to do is I can connect to the

301
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:19,410
toy I can find the toy I can find the

302
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,210
toy within about 50 feet which just so

303
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,589
we're clear is about the distance from

304
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,130
the middle of the standard residential

305
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,500
street

306
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,120
any point in a home and I can use that

307
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,940
to find out which room of the home the

308
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,940
toy is in then I can take the toy over

309
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:42,510
now once I've taken the toy this takes

310
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:43,140
just a moment I can do whatever I want

311
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,810
with it

312
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:49,260
I can issue commands that don't exist in

313
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,540
game play I can choose to record with it

314
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,760
for example I remember how I said the

315
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,010
heart goes on when you record normally

316
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,720
well that's a separate software command

317
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,620
I could just choose not to turn that on

318
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,600
and instead I could just start recording

319
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:08,330
without you knowing that I'm doing it

320
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,330
yadda yadda and then when we're done I

321
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:17,970
can mic your house or if I wanted to I

322
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,600
could give the command that makes it

323
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,720
look like a message has come from a

324
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,120
parent when it hasn't and I could

325
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,430
actually shove my own audio across to it

326
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:35,880
and then I could actually play my audio

327
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:38,250
remotely good half the audience got that

328
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:42,330
that's excellent but instead of it being

329
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:45,450
a Dalek yelling it could be instead hey

330
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:49,800
this is mommy I'm back early don't wait

331
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:52,140
daddy come outside and that's when

332
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,760
things get very scary now that's

333
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,970
ignoring the fact that they stored their

334
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,560
entire database of user accounts

335
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,690
passwords and audio recordings in an

336
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,729
unprotected location and it all got

337
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,760
stolen that's a whole nother story

338
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,640
but as a direct threat against people I

339
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,770
can drive by your home and I can find

340
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,930
this and I can talk to it and I can

341
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:16,890
locate the bedroom with it and it's only

342
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:18,660
one of many products so we concern

343
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:22,710
ourselves greatly with this question of

344
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,750
what is possible in the IOT world and

345
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:29,490
what new threats are we facing in the

346
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,810
IOT world okay but it's not just

347
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,300
Bluetooth

348
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:37,319
I can give you example of Wi-Fi that's

349
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,339
an issue now fisher-price tell me if

350
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,550
you've ever heard of the brand named

351
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,890
fisher-price okay this is a respected

352
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,390
brand you can easily write off the cloud

353
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,980
Pat is saying who knows that person

354
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,130
that's just some small company the

355
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:54,090
millah know where whatever but

356
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:57,960
fisher-price is gonna get it right no no

357
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:00,060
they're really not okay so we took this

358
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,560
toy and a high school student and we

359
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,099
said hey let's find out what's going on

360
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:08,310
inside now the way this toy works is you

361
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:10,530
hold a card in front of its face it sees

362
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,960
the card it plays the game that way a

363
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,300
child doesn't have to use a toy now pay

364
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,100
a phone to play with now a parent also

365
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,050
has a phone and they can issue great

366
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,480
game commands like brush your teeth

367
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,129
clean your room go to bed which is why

368
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,730
parents love this toy okay

369
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:29,220
but the child deals with it primarily

370
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,490
through these cards and a very small

371
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,890
nose camera now our assumption was okay

372
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,080
they put a nose camera in the pictures

373
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,510
are very simple it must be a grayscale

374
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,429
high contrast image you have to hold it

375
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,820
four inches off the nose that must mean

376
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,590
that okay this this cameras got maybe

377
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,750
some sort of a lens on it that's got a

378
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,360
high angle so after six inches you can't

379
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,750
see any things it's all blurry totally

380
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,270
makes sense not scary at all

381
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:59,310
well ah that's not what we found he

382
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:02,040
knows when it's been thrown up and down

383
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,139
it knows when it's being hugged and it

384
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,790
has a PowerPoint on its back that when

385
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,030
you plug it in it shuts down and does

386
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:11,870
Wi-Fi enabled backups now where does

387
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,950
this mean we know it's Wi-Fi capable I

388
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,679
will give it away the fact that the

389
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:19,430
power unit on the back does not carry

390
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,680
data they data clipped it so that's good

391
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,270
but we have interesting concerns about

392
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:30,210
this because when we open it up and look

393
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:32,340
inside this is what we find now the a23

394
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,170
dual-core chip was the first thing that

395
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,490
caught our attention that's pretty

396
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:41,730
interesting the 32 gig hard drive also

397
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,140
caught our attention now we knew there'd

398
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,429
be a Realtek card in there that's no

399
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,299
surprise that's that's the

400
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:50,190
Wi-Fi Bluetooth down here this this

401
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:53,789
ribbon port for an LCD that's kind of

402
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:56,100
odd because there's no LCD anywhere this

403
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:58,470
camera here that was a little concerning

404
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,570
but we already knew about it didn't seem

405
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,789
to have a lens cap on it but can you

406
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,879
guys see this right here

407
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:08,340
where does that look like that's a

408
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:11,570
microUSB port hiding inside the center

409
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:16,408
of a machine what our what that's for

410
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:19,678
shall I show you this isn't the Android

411
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:24,330
tablet that's all it is

412
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,460
okay and what they did was they crammed

413
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,168
it in the head they were in a

414
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,240
specialized operating system that uses

415
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,830
two gigs and leaves 30 gigs unallocated

416
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,249
in case anybody wants some place to

417
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:40,110
stuff data of whatever kind it's all out

418
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:41,450
there and it turns out the camera runs

419
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,039
all the time

420
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:51,330
turns out the camera is a 1080p video

421
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:55,169
camera but it gets better it's running

422
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:59,189
Android 442 it's a full Android tablet

423
00:19:55,169 --> 00:20:02,970
and a teddy bears head oh but it gets

424
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,710
better so I thought today hey while I'm

425
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,190
here let me just shoot some video

426
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,980
through the teddy bear of the the back

427
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,190
speaker room ah come on

428
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:19,759
really my apologies but I do want you be

429
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,759
able to see this

430
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:42,039
so if we here we go you can see that

431
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,039
it's rotated up but as you can see I

432
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:50,110
have full control I can do full video

433
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:57,529
there we go

434
00:20:52,899 --> 00:21:01,219
why can I do this I can do this because

435
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:03,799
it is a full Android and it's running a

436
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:08,960
standard operating system and I'm able

437
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:12,049
to do it because they stripped out all

438
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,809
the users they running the operating

439
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:17,139
system completely as root and debugger

440
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:20,029
mode is turned on by default

441
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:22,010
anybody who plugs into that port has

442
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:25,639
full control to install any software

443
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:28,908
they want at all I mean you could

444
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:33,070
install things like this old netcat ping

445
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:35,269
that I've got here you could install

446
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,340
versions of Tor now that you're gonna do

447
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:40,279
a lot with it but most importantly you

448
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:43,459
can install tcp/ip based remote access

449
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:46,340
software like visor which is what we did

450
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,659
and I can run it over tcp/ip I don't

451
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,959
have to have a direct cable if I don't

452
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:52,639
want to which means that all I need is I

453
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,570
need physical access to the toy for

454
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:59,750
three minutes I have to make a little

455
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,389
seam cut plug in pull out replace my

456
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,789
seam on its way wherever it wakes up I

457
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:06,529
have full control and this is not a

458
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:07,658
unique toy there are plenty other toys

459
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:10,360
that have problems

460
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:13,130
this one's just repeatedly egregious

461
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,689
because some engineers somewhere decided

462
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,200
that nobody would ever open up a toy

463
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,909
look inside

464
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,679
so what does that mean that means that

465
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:25,039
we need to be looking at ways that we

466
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,470
can empower users to protect themselves

467
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,519
against these kind of attacks and others

468
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,159
most importantly I'm interested in

469
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,600
question of Wi-Fi and I'm really

470
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,230
interested in the question of Bluetooth

471
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,689
Low Energy

472
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,269
because Bluetooth Low Energy is

473
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:42,509
pervasive on our bodies and our homes

474
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:44,009
and a lot of these devices scream out

475
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:45,210
and tell a lot of people about them so

476
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,499
they're valuable enough to dry it you

477
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,269
were driving down the street with just a

478
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:51,659
Bluetooth scanner on we amazed what you

479
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:53,070
see and the question is how do we

480
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,450
protect ourselves from people who are

481
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,519
doing these things whether it's to

482
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,139
actually take the device whether it's to

483
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,379
dock somebody for something embarrassing

484
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:03,570
in their home for whatever reason and

485
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:05,639
this is where we began asking this

486
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,759
question of if we could protect our

487
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:10,139
users so what's the design we'd be

488
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,220
looking for we'd be looking for

489
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:14,248
something that requires minimal

490
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,739
education for the user to use we looking

491
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:18,929
at something that empowers mitigation

492
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:20,669
where a user can protect themselves and

493
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:25,320
we're looking for something that gave

494
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:27,899
them real-time information so a little

495
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,309
bit of Education but mostly really

496
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:36,119
simple communication of ambient threat

497
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:39,570
situations so it makes sense so you've

498
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:42,749
seen the attack against this guy this is

499
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,840
the secured alit self - cute little guy

500
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:50,280
and yes it's still very much in its

501
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,159
proof of concept stage so

502
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,399
is

503
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,400
[Music]

504
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,100
there we go

505
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:06,320
we'll wake up long-term our goal is to

506
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,159
have who here ever has heard of atomic

507
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,750
Gucci good basically just a little toy

508
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,230
about this big hangs off your backpack

509
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:17,330
hangs off your purse and it can it

510
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,770
carries very little mission it could be

511
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,159
as simple as a button like the glowy

512
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,260
buttons we have here you get it small

513
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,290
you get it to where the user can wear it

514
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:30,980
and then you get it so that what it does

515
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:34,399
is as it measures certain parameters

516
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,800
around it it just changes colors just

517
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,330
simple colors right because we all know

518
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,060
that green means things are going pretty

519
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:43,220
good yellow means we should probably be

520
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,490
concerned about what's going on and red

521
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:51,440
means oh god stop whatever is happening

522
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:54,110
let's just stop right so well it's

523
00:24:51,440 --> 00:25:02,960
waking up I'll show you an example so if

524
00:24:54,110 --> 00:25:05,870
we do an attack on unicorn you've seen

525
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,810
what happens correct unicorn will follow

526
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,310
my commands and really a parent has no

527
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,250
way to know that this is happening in

528
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,080
the house and the child effectively has

529
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:21,400
no idea of knowing that somebody else is

530
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:21,399
attacking the toy but what if instead we

531
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:33,530
set this so that when the attack comes

532
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:37,000
the attack actually has to pick which of

533
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,000
the two unicorns are there

534
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,610
and it's a tense

535
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:55,130
unicorn that's not really in the corn

536
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:56,928
and issues any command that's giving the

537
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,140
command to the unicorn that's the real

538
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:02,270
unicorn then when he goes back he does

539
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,700
the second one he chooses the other

540
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,820
unicorn because we have the turtle

541
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,890
showing up as a unicorn it looks exactly

542
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,470
like a unicorn to anybody externally

543
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,990
with a USB only with a Bluetooth

544
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:17,480
low-energy and they issue any kind of a

545
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,900
connection command a turtle goes

546
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,190
ballistic goes red let you know that

547
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,559
somebody is attempting to connect to

548
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,450
bluetooth devices in your home now we

549
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,700
can rotate this out it doesn't have to

550
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,270
be why are you not waking up doesn't

551
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,270
have to be

552
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:40,580
[Music]

553
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,810
doesn't have to be cloud Pet we can set

554
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,370
this up as anything's matter of fact

555
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,260
what we'd like to do is set it up as a

556
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,360
series of twelve different devices that

557
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,370
if you stood in front of my house you

558
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,229
just see all these different bluetooth

559
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,290
low energy devices popping up and

560
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,390
shutting down and popping up it would be

561
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,490
like oh if you like visual glimmer it

562
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,960
would be amazing and if you connect it

563
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,490
to any of them I would catch you doing

564
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,840
and then I would know you'd be there

565
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:07,820
doing it now what about what about Wi-Fi

566
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,360
can we do the same thing of your Wi-Fi

567
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,250
yes absolutely if you attempt to talk to

568
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,719
the turtle via Wi-Fi through ping

569
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,180
through an ssh through anything like

570
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,320
that we'll catch you doing it and we'll

571
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:24,290
know instantly and what we do hardware

572
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:29,270
wise is pretty simple currently we're

573
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:31,700
just using a Raspberry Pi zero big

574
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:37,450
battery battery board it's really that

575
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:40,610
easy and then python modules and

576
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:43,370
basically using a graduated number

577
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:46,070
system so we determine what level of

578
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,429
threat given activities are those

579
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:51,860
cumulate up and when they reach a

580
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,880
certain threshold number wise it goes

581
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,790
yellow and they reach a certain

582
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,940
threshold level they go to red that make

583
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:02,180
sense okay and the modules can be laid

584
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:04,670
out in a thousand different ways and our

585
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,460
long-term goal is to actually move this

586
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:10,030
off of Python and PI to something that's

587
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,700
much more board dedicated on a smaller p

588
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,960
a smaller PCB board so that we can get

589
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,240
the size of the thing down right now

590
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,800
it's enormous

591
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,380
and also it uses way too much battery

592
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,659
but you get the concept now

593
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,060
the question many people ask is okay

594
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,490
this is great but how does this help

595
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,010
grandma well it helps grandma because

596
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,940
grandmother then knows what behaviors to

597
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,060
do and not do

598
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,120
I met Starbucks I want to log into my

599
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:41,510
bank account okay I'll go with this

600
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,280
kernel she curls green probably okay to

601
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,650
log in the bank account if I look over

602
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,670
at Sakura land it's red all I gotta do

603
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,390
is say grandma

604
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:52,070
if it's read don't do anything just do

605
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,720
something else now is not the time to

606
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,210
log into the bank count she doesn't need

607
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,220
to know why it's red although we've been

608
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,990
asked for people to please put a little

609
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,580
monochrome board on the bottom to give a

610
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,350
readout of why it's doing it so the

611
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,149
geeks can have all of our fun

612
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,070
understanding what's really going on and

613
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,570
maybe try to find the person in there

614
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,889
that's doing something they should but

615
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,360
grandma doesn't need to know that and

616
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,310
and my eight-year-old doesn't need to

617
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,169
know that they just need to know that

618
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,820
right now something is going on and they

619
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,100
need to be at a higher level of security

620
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,020
in their behaviors and they need to

621
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:27,740
mitigate against those that make sense

622
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:30,050
okay and that is for the most part what

623
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,970
the secure is designed to do does a

624
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:35,300
pretty good job we're still in

625
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,470
production of it we are interested if

626
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,180
there are other people who want to work

627
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,280
with us we would definitely be

628
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,670
interested in talking more about it I've

629
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,870
got some information here for those of

630
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,570
you who have never been to a door fruit

631
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,010
Adafruit is the best thing in the world

632
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,510
it's cool this website for learning how

633
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:54,379
to do things especially Bluetooth Low

634
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:57,640
Energy I'm trying to see where I'm on my

635
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:03,580
time card here okay I'm spell the time

636
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,580
so anybody have any questions

637
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:19,790
yeah yeah so we'd like to do basically

638
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,470
all the spectrums we'd like to do siggy

639
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:26,350
and everything we can get our hands on

640
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:29,720
the trick is power consumption right now

641
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,370
because we're on Raspberry Pi zero our

642
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,500
time on life on that even though that

643
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,959
battery is pretty big our time on life

644
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,300
is only about an hour which doesn't

645
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,490
really give us much if we can get

646
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,430
smaller we want to put more antennas in

647
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:45,260
it we want to put more frequencies in it

648
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,030
but we also want to begin rotating out

649
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:51,379
other things so that we have a series of

650
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,879
things that looks like on the Wi-Fi we'd

651
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,060
like to have two separate Wi-Fi is

652
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:01,100
running we quickly get into a problem

653
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:03,530
with Wi-Fi on the question of do we only

654
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:07,969
attach to other wife eyes and watch

655
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:10,760
behaviors coming in or do we do we try

656
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,220
to do some analysis of actual traffic

657
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,180
that's flowing we have one PhD whose

658
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:19,550
current work right now is analyzing

659
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,770
packet behaviors in the Wi-Fi spectrum

660
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,600
so that you can watch packets coming

661
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:27,170
through and begin to say okay that's a

662
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,959
camera okay that is a doorbell okay

663
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:33,260
that is a laptop and then begin to

664
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,720
assign numbers to those because you can

665
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,840
begin to say well you know if it's a

666
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,910
thermostat for you know a house we can

667
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,560
rate that lower if that's if that's a

668
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,090
camera maybe that's a little bit higher

669
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,370
if that's a laptop okay now we really

670
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,030
got to be concerned but we're still in

671
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,030
progress on that

672
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:54,240
we'd like to get it the size of what

673
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,990
he's wearing right now that's blinking

674
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,420
at me

675
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,550
so about this big as what we would like

676
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,440
the turtle is the form we're very happy

677
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:05,490
with so it's our little Sakura but it

678
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,070
could be anything by making it a cute

679
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,630
little turtle it creates the image of

680
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,389
you know when a turtle gets scared it

681
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,470
pulls in and hides and is safe and

682
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,510
that's kind of what we're telling our

683
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,700
users to do is they don't necessarily

684
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,740
know why we're telling them to hide but

685
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,910
now's a good time to hide or at least

686
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:28,800
not interact in risky behaviors at that

687
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:34,740
time that makes sense a minutes how many

688
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:40,980
questions we made it it's right now it's

689
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:42,960
handmade Wow listen sorry yeah no we

690
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,350
can't we made this thing ourselves and

691
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,510
then we are moving on forward into

692
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,610
trying to get smaller and then we'll go

693
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,370
into production if if it's deemed to

694
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,659
we've got our University's patent people

695
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,919
are looking at and trying to tell us if

696
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,590
it's interesting enough to be really

697
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,580
interesting or if it's not and pearl we

698
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,540
have to wait for them to make that

699
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,340
decision see where we go from here but

700
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:11,908
okay

701
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:13,949
any other questions is the turtle

702
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:17,730
broadcasting right now the turtle is

703
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:24,980
actually a passive toy at this time he

704
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:28,559
did turn red Wow yeah yeah yep yep

705
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:32,370
so he's the one who did it yeah and

706
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,168
that's that's the idea so we made the

707
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:37,350
cloud because table pet because club

708
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:39,720
head is an extremely well known toy that

709
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:42,178
can be attacked a lot of Bluetooth

710
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,179
low-energy devices don't broadcast their

711
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:48,480
names which is the way to do it but some

712
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:50,789
do so frankly our plan was to make it if

713
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,740
we picked out 12 we'd have a handful of

714
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:57,899
toys in there we'd probably put some a

715
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,850
little bit racier maybe adult materials

716
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,699
in there that would be very exciting for

717
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,110
somebody to run across and attack on and

718
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,029
maybe some things that sound like they

719
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,368
were sensitive data information and

720
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:10,500
basically just put out really baiting

721
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:12,629
honey pots and if anybody attempts to

722
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,089
attach to it then we we've got something

723
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:16,440
going on

724
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,909
we've not planned to do anything when

725
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,069
we're actually broadcasting at this

726
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:22,260
point nor are we looking to set up

727
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:24,719
actual attachment points where we would

728
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,460
actually create a honey pot that

729
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:33,359
somebody would attach to that's the step

730
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:35,810
too far we can't go to so yeah any other

731
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,810
questions

732
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:43,909
say that again cuz I like it say good

733
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:51,869
lasers or guns to it I can't we've

734
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,969
considered audio because one of problems

735
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:57,869
with making it so that it's yellow-green

736
00:34:53,969 --> 00:35:00,029
it's sorry it's green yellow red is that

737
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:01,710
people who are colorblind red green

738
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,130
can't tell the difference between good

739
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:08,030
state and difficult state so we've been

740
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,030
looking at its

741
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,710
you

742
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:25,530
green solid yellow slow pulsing red fast

743
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:28,180
pulsing or just putting an alarm on it

744
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,730
alarms are tricky because users very

745
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,210
quickly grow to ignore them so you have

746
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:37,480
to use them extremely sparingly and

747
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:44,350
we've not gone there yet lasers would be

748
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:51,160
cool anything else any questions about

749
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:53,350
any of the other work with yeah so the

750
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,140
way we've cut currently set up if you

751
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:59,740
ping on it or you do any other sort of

752
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:02,560
simple recon to it it'll excite it'll

753
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,299
begin turning yellow pretty quickly and

754
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,279
it'll put up with that for a little bit

755
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:11,710
but it'll eventually accumulate to red

756
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:15,180
if instead you attempt to SSH into it

757
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:18,070
and you fail authentication against SSH

758
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:20,950
twice it goes straight to red it won't

759
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,540
put up with that at all so it's it's a

760
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:25,480
graduated system we're doing it on a

761
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:27,160
number base and it's will fine tune it

762
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,250
eventually but the idea is is the

763
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:32,140
concept that some things are risky but

764
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:34,480
not that risky and then some things are

765
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,859
really risky and when we eventually put

766
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,470
it out we'd like to have it so that

767
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,030
people can self those people who are

768
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,770
really into it would have the option to

769
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,660
self adjust up and down what they wanted

770
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,640
their risk laws to be do they want to be

771
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,960
draconian and go off easy or do they

772
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,019
want to be live life a little riskier so

773
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,019
[Music]

774
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,520
oh no it does Wi-Fi right now actually

775
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,960
[Music]

776
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:15,170
currently I don't it is not set to a

777
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:18,869
understand man-in-the-middle attack I

778
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:25,859
would have to think about how we tell it

779
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:26,940
I would have to think on that because it

780
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:29,009
depends on what kind of man in the

781
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,000
middle attack you're doing obviously I

782
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,000
mean it's gonna

783
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,658
[Music]

784
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:48,740
yep absolutely yes

785
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,299
if the pineapple is simply watching

786
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,120
traffic going through and acting

787
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,250
passively it's a current setting it's

788
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,670
not going to know however if the

789
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:02,330
pineapple is set to do anything back at

790
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:04,550
the target system so if if you create a

791
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:07,610
hot spot using a pineapple or an alpha

792
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,900
or whatever you're gonna do and the

793
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,220
reason you're doing that's just because

794
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,720
you're gonna sniff stuff as it goes

795
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,549
through and then you'll do something

796
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,580
with it later we're not gonna pick that

797
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:19,720
up but if you're doing that so that when

798
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:22,640
his laptop attaches to your pineapple

799
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,069
you're gonna go ahead and use that hot

800
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,960
spot to try to come back at his machine

801
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,940
and exfiltrate something actively we

802
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,650
would totally pick up on that so right

803
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,480
now we're dealing with active attacks

804
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,360
against the target against the turtle

805
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,740
we're not doing anything that's that's

806
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,410
passive at that level we don't have a

807
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,520
mechanism for that yet I'm sure we'll

808
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:46,220
think of something we just don't have

809
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:48,500
that yet so I have to think about how we

810
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:51,040
would do that because we probably could

811
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,110
do is we could probably do some sort of

812
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,790
sending information out to a known end

813
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:58,670
source and watch how it flows through

814
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,380
and see if there's variations and use

815
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,320
some sort of thing back on that but I

816
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:12,720
just honestly don't know so

817
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:16,040
