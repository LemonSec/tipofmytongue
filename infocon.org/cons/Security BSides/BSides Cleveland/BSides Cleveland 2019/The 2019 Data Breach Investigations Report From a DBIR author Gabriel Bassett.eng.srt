1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
presentation okay so who here has heard

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,020
of the data breach investigations report

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,480
oh that's awesome

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,940
that's people I'm Gabriel Bassett I'm

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,490
the lead data scientist for the 2019 dbi

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,289
are I do like the tooling behind the

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,390
report the figure is the fact checking

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,510
not incident out so I also write a few

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,369
sections and I'm not the only author

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,050
these are the four people so if I put

11
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,369
myself up here beside it these are the

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,269
five people who wrote the report this

13
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,099
year

14
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,288
if anyone if Rison tells you otherwise

15
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,140
they're lying

16
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,399
and it happens now I'm going to come up

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,660
and I'm going to talk about a bunch of

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,160
lists of things that I think are

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,898
interesting stuff but most of the things

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,879
that are gonna be on slide are going to

21
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,120
be charts and figures and stuff like

22
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,099
that so I put all of the interesting

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,809
lists of things to do and stuff like

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,489
that in a separate PDF that's on an AWS

25
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,809
you can go download it this way you

26
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,038
don't have to worry about trying to type

27
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,260
it out as I say because it's certainly

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,579
never gonna show up on screen

29
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,680
I'll have this also at the very end as

30
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,480
well so when I click away from it here

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,580
in like five seconds don't feel like

32
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,729
you've lost it forever

33
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:11,340
so what is the DVR when we started the

34
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,429
report back a dozen years ago data

35
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,900
security information security was very

36
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,009
anecdotal right you heard the story

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,270
about some breach and it's like oh

38
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,040
that's what we got to do we have to

39
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,179
protect against that and then the next

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,100
story came up and was completely

41
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,619
different and that's what people protect

42
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,908
against and the problem was it wasn't

43
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,890
really telling the story of what the

44
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,979
average organization should expect see

45
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,329
and so they started we're going through

46
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,820
our Incident Response reports and

47
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,820
analyzing them as a data set and over

48
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,439
time we've added countries contributors

49
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,500
breaches incidents and even non incident

50
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,470
data like malware blocks phishing tests

51
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,009
honeypot data stuff like that and the

52
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,020
whole goal here is to decrease the bias

53
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,149
in the data set as well as improve the

54
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,770
context around what we report so that

55
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,840
when we report on this is what we think

56
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,920
happens to the normal company that is

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,950
something that people can make decisions

58
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,299
based on and so before we get too far in

59
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,130
I want to clear up two major

60
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,680
misconceptions that come up every single

61
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,769
year the first is the attackers are

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,569
almost always external because right we

63
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,800
always hear things like yeah you know

64
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,060
people talk about the extra

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,410
attacking but you really have to worry

66
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,690
about the insider you need to worry

67
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,920
about the exit I exercise guy like he's

68
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,170
the one who's your big problem because

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,760
even most of the internal stuff our air

70
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,149
is people just making mistakes they're

71
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,310
not malicious and the other one is that

72
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,160
most of the attacks are espionage in

73
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,650
fact almost all attacks well a

74
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,870
substantial increases attacks are

75
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,260
financial espionage even this uptick

76
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,020
here is due to mainly public

77
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,850
administrations so government almost all

78
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,770
the attackers are financially motivated

79
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,170
even some of the espionage is financial

80
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,970
and so getting those two big

81
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,700
misconceptions out of the way let's get

82
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,040
into the meat of it if there's one thing

83
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,440
I want you to take away from this entire

84
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,299
report of everything I'm going to come

85
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,980
up here and say it's that the attackers

86
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,650
are not just looking for the easy win

87
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,880
they're looking for the easiest win and

88
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,010
what that means to see you as an

89
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,810
organization don't have to be perfect

90
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,810
you don't even actually have to be good

91
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,420
just have to be a little better than

92
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,650
worst and so this is what I mean by that

93
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:24,619
the four things you have to worry about

94
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:28,230
the four horsemen it's catching airs

95
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:31,709
social attacks in credentials those four

96
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,109
things are like 85% of all breaches so

97
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,280
let's go into those individually

98
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,530
starting with patching and when I say

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,350
patching I don't mean like like it's

100
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,030
cool if you've got the the patch process

101
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,190
it gets things patched every month or

102
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,580
every week you got everything patched

103
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,609
when I say patching I mean like try to

104
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,070
patch you know telnet facing the

105
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,780
internet like I mean the obvious stuff

106
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,609
and I mean the obvious stuff facing the

107
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,870
Internet that's ten years old because

108
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,330
that's the kind of stuff you get him

109
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,520
with patching and so what we have up

110
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:06,180
here is this is data from honeypot data

111
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:09,030
versus like internet scan data and it's

112
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:14,190
the ratio of the ranks and so for

113
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:16,168
example telnet look for on the other

114
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,519
hand it's only the 15th most common port

115
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,668
on the internet and the ratio of like 1

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,320
of 15 is 15 if you these are the highest

117
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,180
ratios and if you look these are all

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,090
things that we have known

119
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,290
vulnerabilities for right

120
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,450
but they're not like new known

121
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,240
vulnerabilities there like

122
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,180
vulnerabilities that are as old as our

123
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,590
middle schoolers these are old things

124
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,820
and so try to get those off the internet

125
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,099
which is easier said than done it's like

126
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,120
the reality is like we probably if

127
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,040
you're in this room listening this you

128
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,600
probably know to patch things or you

129
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,150
know turn on the firewall things like

130
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,750
that on the other hand what tends to

131
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,940
bite us is asset discovery a lot of

132
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,350
times we don't simply know what assets

133
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,190
other parts of organizations are putting

134
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,260
online and so a big part to effective

135
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,660
patching is one having good asset

136
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,460
discovery and asset management and to

137
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,840
going out and actually looking for what

138
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,460
might have happened or might have gotten

139
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,369
put on the internet while you aren't

140
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,560
watching as a security organization the

141
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,600
second thing to talk about are heirs and

142
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,310
so if you read the report you might have

143
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,350
noticed admins are starting to trend up

144
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,970
and that's not because your system ins

145
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,919
are evil well it's not because most

146
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:28,100
assignments are evil I can't really talk

147
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,299
about your sis admins most of them are

148
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,890
not evil most of them are making

149
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,020
mistakes in fact what we're seeing here

150
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,820
is a change in how we report security

151
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,580
right because now when someone has a

152
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,400
breach of a cloud-based service they

153
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,650
find like an open storage bucket on the

154
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,719
internet like the researcher that finds

155
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,580
that doesn't go and necessarily just

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,710
tell the organization help them close it

157
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,539
they also go to the news outlet go hey

158
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,659
we found a billion recruited tools you

159
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:55,430
know stored in the storage bucket online

160
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,020
and because it gets public reported it

161
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,479
gets put into datasets like ours and

162
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,159
that causes air to trend up but we've

163
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,450
really known this has been a problem for

164
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,340
years and years and years because the

165
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,260
industries that have mandatory reporting

166
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,840
like health care and public

167
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,729
administration both have had really high

168
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,679
rates of air compared to all the other

169
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,979
industries but that means that the air

170
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,150
goes underreported so you know what can

171
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:19,849
you do about it

172
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,039
first who here what like if I want you

173
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,770
to do anything I want you to treat air

174
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:29,030
is the same way you treat patching and

175
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:31,849
vulnerabilities because airs represent

176
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,289
21 percent of breaches this year

177
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,270
vulnerabilities exploiting

178
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,370
vulnerabilities represent at most six

179
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,530
percent of breaches this year you know

180
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,360
let that sink in because else

181
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,460
I suspect that most you're spending a

182
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
whole bunch of money on patching and

183
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,940
dealing with vulnerabilities and hunting

184
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,989
down those little things but that's not

185
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,430
what the attackers won because they want

186
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,590
the easiest thing right and exploiting

187
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,130
vulnerabilities isn't always easy

188
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,840
on the other hand errors just happen you

189
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,390
know it doesn't take some long complex

190
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,010
attack path and so who here is spinning

191
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:05,030
twenty percent of their security budget

192
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:07,039
on fixing to mitigating airs who here is

193
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,010
spinning any of their security budget on

194
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,540
fixing mitigating airs good we got like

195
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,030
two additional three additional hands

196
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,760
for that one right we should be spinning

197
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,979
you know almost as much money on fixing

198
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,409
airs as we are dealing with credentials

199
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,000
or dealing with patching you know and

200
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,960
far more than we should be spending on

201
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,100
vulnerabilities because we're actually

202
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,159
doing a good job of handling

203
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,810
vulnerabilities and how do you spend

204
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,010
that money you want to prepare to grip

205
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,480
the great gracefully I'd like gonna

206
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,669
drive back to Nashville Tennessee right

207
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,680
after this talk and on the drive back

208
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:38,479
you know if my car springs a leak and if

209
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,180
the tire Springs like I don't expect the

210
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,860
car to explode but you know that happens

211
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,780
in security you have one air and it

212
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,580
turns into a huge problem it turns into

213
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,830
a breach and so looking around your

214
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,450
organization find the data that if it

215
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,210
were exposed would turn into a breach

216
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,770
and look at the processes procedures

217
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,500
systems that touch that data because the

218
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,770
reality is no person no process no

219
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,900
system no tool is perfect and we always

220
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,490
act like the are tweaks we build our

221
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,840
systems on the assumption that our the

222
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,900
people are gonna be perfect and then

223
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,159
we're like my gosh he clicked something

224
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,359
that's silly we build them on the

225
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,740
assumption that our tools gonna be

226
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,130
perfect it's gonna stop everything it

227
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,100
didn't stop everything we have to plan

228
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,110
for failure of our systems and this

229
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,850
isn't it as hard as it sounds right

230
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,140
because process improvement systems have

231
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,030
been looking at this for years and so

232
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,030
you can go and look at process

233
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,919
improvement frameworks and how they

234
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,010
improve their processes and apply those

235
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,809
back to your security processes now the

236
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,580
third part is social engineering or

237
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,750
social attacks and these can come in two

238
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,940
different parts financially motivated

239
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,979
social engineering and phishing we'll

240
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,770
talk about financially motivated social

241
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,360
engineering first and we used to like

242
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,290
when we came into the report we probably

243
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,530
would have called a business email

244
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,000
compromise but we started to look and a

245
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,760
lot of these don't actually even

246
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,320
fire an email to be compromised like in

247
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,210
fact there was one last week that was

248
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,890
not really one we put in the report as

249
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,480
it was compromising individuals but it

250
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,490
was like some person created an email

251
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,370
account that sounded like roughly the

252
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,990
same as a pastor at a church and then

253
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,490
emailed everyone there saying hey I'm

254
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,810
collecting money to do whatever and

255
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,690
people start sending the person money

256
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,280
right they didn't compromise anything in

257
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,350
fact this is my favorite quote from the

258
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,850
entire port you have to hand it to the

259
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,650
attackers at some point one must have

260
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,300
just thought why don't we skip all the

261
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,939
hard hacking and you know like just ask

262
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:30,109
for the money and it works it works all

263
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,460
the time you know and so you need to be

264
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,900
prepared for it and the reason of course

265
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,670
if they're targeting executives is

266
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,530
because that's where the money is like

267
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,000
if I want to go and spend a thousand

268
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,860
dollars I have to go through four levels

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,960
of approval on the other hand I'm an

270
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,610
executive says hey transfer a bit of

271
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,970
money that's gonna happen in fact I'm

272
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,770
the CFO for another nonprofit and like

273
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,790
I'm like haha this is funny oh shoot

274
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,670
that's me

275
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,260
because right if I get an email from our

276
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,640
CEO that says hey you know we're

277
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,930
ordering stickers for this conference

278
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,130
you know can you send a hundred bucks to

279
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,380
the dude who ordered him and put it

280
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,280
together I'm like sure that sounds like

281
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,780
a great idea

282
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,910
and then like I'm going to end up in my

283
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,949
own data set and that's not good you

284
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,050
know and so I can see how these things

285
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,020
happen but you need to be prepared to

286
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,750
have a process to verify money transfers

287
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,980
outside of email for anything below what

288
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,120
you're willing to lose because we're

289
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,250
going to talk about it later but the

290
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,380
median email compromise cost according

291
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,270
the FBI was twenty four thousand dollars

292
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,700
according to the FBI's data set this is

293
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,370
the ic3 data but they present it

294
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,770
differently when they talk about it and

295
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,900
so twenty four thousand dollars isn't a

296
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,480
lot in the scheme of a large business

297
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,060
and so you need to be prepared to have a

298
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,500
process around at that level of spinning

299
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,079
unless you're willing to lose that

300
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,950
amount of money now the other half of

301
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,570
this is a social tax and so now the good

302
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,750
news is we're getting better at fishing

303
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,520
right it was 25% of phishing test emails

304
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,280
were working in 2012 and now we're down

305
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,040
to 3% but on the other hand we're still

306
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,140
hovering around 20% or above a fish

307
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,640
breaches involving phishing and so the

308
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,970
question is why is that

309
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,519
and a good example is like my wife over

310
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:13,430
lit Memorial Day we're out at my

311
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:17,029
brother-in-law's lake house it's kind of

312
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,229
like house or beautiful dock and so

313
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:22,640
we're down there and my wife's fishing

314
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,350
along the shore and now granted like she

315
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,910
could have walked 20 feet out to the

316
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,279
under than into the dock and fish

317
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,769
straight out into the like really out

318
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,540
into the lake right because the reality

319
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:34,040
is most a big fish are probably down in

320
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,360
the lake somewhere they're probably swim

321
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,170
in the middle a little bit deeper you

322
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,870
know

323
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,430
in fact 97 percent of the fish might be

324
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,620
down there in the middle of a lake but

325
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,569
if there's a three percent that are

326
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,640
along the bank and that's enough to keep

327
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,260
her happy fishing all day there's no

328
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,050
reason for her to even walk to the other

329
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,550
end of the dock right and the same thing

330
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,829
applies to the attackers if that three

331
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,050
percent is enough to keep them busy day

332
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:59,779
to day stealing money from us they're

333
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,459
going to do it and so what can we do

334
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,689
about it and this is based off of the

335
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,489
data that we've looked at right is

336
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,459
there's three things you need to block

337
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,290
by email you need to block links you

338
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,000
need to block executable attachments and

339
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,670
you need to block macro enabled office

340
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,899
documents because one what I mean we're

341
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,219
not really getting a lot of links and

342
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:20,570
more than likely those links are gonna

343
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,560
look like a like a log in to something

344
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,120
they're gonna steal credentials and

345
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,819
maybe you have a tool that simply

346
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,100
filters that no one's getting their

347
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,750
executables by email like what was the

348
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,730
last time someone mailed you and

349
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,519
executable and it was a legitimate thing

350
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,630
right that doesn't happen does it and

351
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,890
the other thing is there's maybe three

352
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,480
or four people in your organization that

353
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,160
need macro enabled office documents so

354
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,990
you can set up that separate process for

355
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,810
them but no one else should be allowed

356
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,850
to touch those the other things you can

357
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,920
do to stop fishing is give people an

358
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,390
easy way to report because most your

359
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,099
fishing reports are gonna come in in the

360
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,600
first hour but only a third of the

361
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,040
clicks happen in the first hour because

362
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,360
those are the people that were like

363
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,130
sitting at their desk and are really

364
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,680
like keeping up on email then there's

365
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,839
the rest of the people the next third

366
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,910
comes in over the next day and the next

367
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,529
third comes in over the next week and so

368
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,180
potentially if you're giving people the

369
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:10,399
ability to report and you're acting on

370
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,779
their reports you could stop two-thirds

371
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,329
of the fishing clicks before they ever

372
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,829
happen and so give people way to report

373
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:17,270
and then finally like there's people in

374
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,910
your organization

375
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,280
you have to open attachments like it's

376
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,380
really easy for us in like the IT

377
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,959
portions of the organization to go and I

378
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,470
never open attachments from people I

379
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,210
don't know

380
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,400
you know because let's be honest who

381
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,080
emails like the sysadmin psyche hey yeah

382
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,740
here's a PDF please so I mean other than

383
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,510
like vendors who emails a security

384
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,480
person goes hey here's a PDF please open

385
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,189
it on the other hand your legal

386
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,810
department if they get someone sitting

387
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,790
in them a PDF they've got to open that

388
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,560
right because there's a chance that

389
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,719
could be an existential threat to the

390
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,689
business the PR department has to open

391
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,820
those types of documents and so give

392
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,010
those people leg up give them a sandbox

393
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,870
operating system because while we really

394
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,460
probably do need a whole laptop to do

395
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,140
our work you know they're probably gonna

396
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,700
be happy with something like a tablet or

397
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,870
a sandbox operating system that won't

398
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,220
run them our so set them up for success

399
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,800
and then the final one is credentials

400
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,550
and just to reiterate they were patching

401
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,949
airs social attacks and now credentials

402
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,020
and credentials made up 29% of breaches

403
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,900
this year who here is familiar with

404
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,000
credential stuffing good that's what I

405
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,490
want to see right just so we know what

406
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,260
it is and the reality is attackers are

407
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,480
this is like the number-one way

408
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,800
attackers get in because they're not

409
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,210
really targeted they really don't care

410
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,560
who they get into and if you don't care

411
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,450
who you get into you can just buy all

412
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,040
the credentials you need and then you go

413
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,490
in and target the types of organizations

414
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,730
you want and credentials get used all

415
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,800
the time and a lot of it actually gets

416
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,420
used on mail systems in fact we have

417
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,240
this big bump in like credentials being

418
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,469
used to log into mail systems in cloud

419
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,680
infrastructure and the reason wasn't

420
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,000
because of anything related to cloud it

421
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,310
was because that's where our workflows

422
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,630
are going is to using cloud services for

423
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,609
email and things like that so cloud

424
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,220
isn't less secure it's just where we're

425
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,560
doing our work work nowadays and so what

426
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,600
do you do about this as we got ready for

427
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,160
the Dvir

428
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,680
graph as we were doing kind of the

429
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,170
podcast and stuff where I got the chance

430
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,969
to talk to Rafal losan his and I can't

431
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,500
remember it was on the podcast or before

432
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,570
he said something like you know the DVR

433
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,610
is kind of like it's kind of like an ad

434
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,370
for two-factor authentication and I'm

435
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,250
like yeah it really is cuz like we have

436
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,570
so much credential misuse

437
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,090
factor authentication just adds that

438
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,010
nice extra bump will explain why adding

439
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,330
another step in the attackers tak path

440
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,760
is important as we get in the past

441
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,350
section but it's incredibly important

442
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,450
and of course make sure to turn off IMAP

443
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,040
and pop3 because the two-factor

444
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,340
authentication doesn't necessarily get

445
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,709
applied to those things and also you

446
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,090
know oh when we talk about two-factor

447
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,730
authentication right it's really easy I

448
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,110
almost always skip over this part but we

449
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,840
say like oh yeah it's really easy to

450
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,790
turn on two-factor authentication but

451
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,430
the reality is like for our system

452
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,560
admins and whether it's a larger small

453
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,780
organization this is not necessarily an

454
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,250
easy task if you're a small organization

455
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,449
maybe there's not a lot of work that

456
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,030
goes into if you're have to do a

457
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,710
thousand jobs as a system admin and so

458
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,060
now you have to manage a bunch of users

459
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,800
who aren't really sure how to use

460
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,569
two-factor authentication and you're

461
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,520
having to deal with all that if you're a

462
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,470
big organization yes you know maybe you

463
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,640
have dedicated resources and processes

464
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,160
to deal with it you can pay for

465
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,900
professional support but now you're

466
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,640
trying to integrate it with that really

467
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,199
funky single sign-on system that people

468
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,000
deployed and bounces through a dozen

469
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,890
different links or you're trying to

470
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,680
integrate it with the VPN concatenate er

471
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,750
that's been around since you know God

472
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,250
knows when and no one has any clue how

473
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,410
it works it still works and no one wants

474
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,580
to touch it because of that and so

475
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,380
you're trying to make these things work

476
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,300
and so it is very important to

477
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,070
appreciate the effort that goes into any

478
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,719
of these mitigation since this is also

479
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,820
why it's important to focus on

480
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,460
mitigations on the things to actually

481
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,660
matter these four horsemen and so when

482
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,640
it comes to passwords also do the

483
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,550
obvious stuff get password managers for

484
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,780
your employees to help prevent reuse

485
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,280
look at the services to consolidate

486
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,990
password breaches to see if your

487
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,619
credentials have been breached and

488
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,589
finally have same password policies you

489
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,849
know it doesn't make sense oh this is

490
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,169
I'm gonna complain here and I enjoy

491
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:20,329
getting to complain about it because it

492
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:23,150
fits in really well I have an iPhone and

493
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,530
I just got this iPhone it's the first

494
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,510
time I have an iPhone for my work phone

495
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,060
and I had to put in a PIN number I put

496
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,920
in this really nice random pin and then

497
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,129
three months later they said change your

498
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:37,340
PIN I'm not changing my pin every

499
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,679
quarter my pin is now 20 1901 and it's

500
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,020
going to follow that and long as I have

501
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,810
this phone cuz I'm not changing my pin

502
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,170
that often you know and the same thing

503
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,450
applies

504
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,280
for our users if we give them bad

505
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,580
policies they are going to work around

506
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,260
it and so by the way so those first four

507
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,699
we're talking about like the 85% of

508
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,720
breaches let's talk about the other 15%

509
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,910
really quick and the 15% there's kind of

510
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,590
this standard process and we'll talk

511
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,240
about advanced breaches a couple other

512
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,500
times during the report but what I want

513
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,650
you to take away is these follow a very

514
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,080
different path they're very external

515
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,940
they're very espionage focused they

516
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,830
follow a path of kind of a social attack

517
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,180
leads to dropping malware which leads to

518
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,899
kind of internal hacking and pivoting

519
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,060
and stealing internal data and secrets

520
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,510
now an interesting thing to take away

521
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:29,510
from that right it's a social part the

522
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:32,120
attacks still start with phishing even

523
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,220
the advanced ones and so whether or not

524
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,050
you're dealing or trying to stop the

525
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,390
eighty-four eighty-five percent of the

526
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,560
hundred percent make sure you have a way

527
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,180
of dealing with phishing because the

528
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,129
attacker is like advanced attackers are

529
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,690
much more targeted and if they're

530
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,980
targeted they can't just buy a set of

531
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,450
credentials and hope it goes to the

532
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,250
target they want they actually have to

533
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,620
target the target you know and they're

534
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,430
just as lazy as anyone else and so what

535
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:57,199
are they gonna do they're gonna use

536
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:58,940
phishing because it works you know and

537
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,290
the problem is we also kind of always

538
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,660
spend our time thinking about what

539
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:07,280
happens on target and breaches and we

540
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,860
really want to think in terms of paths

541
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,570
because when it comes to breach is it's

542
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,179
not really a snap in time right it takes

543
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,860
a couple of steps and so if you saw this

544
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,700
in the report you're probably baffled

545
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,169
because it is really it's kind of artsy

546
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,200
but you can't really read it like you

547
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,160
read a book and so having this up here

548
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,480
where I can actually point out I don't

549
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,940
have to like you can use the point I can

550
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,790
like walk up so the way you read this is

551
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,890
these are the steps that takes to get to

552
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,600
the end of the attack and most of the

553
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,460
attacks are pretty short but there's

554
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,830
this one big one out here right this is

555
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,420
14 steps and it's like an action

556
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,540
compromising something in the action

557
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,130
compromising something for each step now

558
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,280
the vertical area like the starting

559
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,290
point is going to be the action which is

560
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,210
also the color and so you see that by

561
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,830
the way this would look much better if

562
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,840
the colors on the bulbs were set up

563
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,990
because like these are I think actually

564
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,490
green

565
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,100
but let's just pretend that all these

566
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,620
ones on the bottom are green we use our

567
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,850
imagination and so all the hacking ones

568
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,669
kind of start at the same spot

569
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,879
vertically and then up here the top are

570
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:15,160
kind of the social ones and they bounce

571
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,200
back and forth and so this is a hacking

572
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,570
action compromising confidentiality and

573
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,980
then another hacking action compromising

574
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,450
integrity and then this is malware and

575
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,370
it kind of goes back and forth and I

576
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,900
really don't expect anyone to read every

577
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:29,260
individual path I want you to get kind

578
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,730
of bare concept out of this and of

579
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:35,920
course the first one is that most of the

580
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:37,960
attacks are short so let's look at those

581
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,500
15% we were talking about the long paths

582
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,540
and this coloring in here is like grayed

583
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,700
out so we're really looking at these

584
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,649
colored ones here and one of the things

585
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,990
you notice is that for advanced attacks

586
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:54,730
they almost all kind of bounce back and

587
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:57,400
forth between hacking and malware they a

588
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,830
lot of them start with phishing up here

589
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,000
and this leads into one of the things I

590
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,669
want you to take away I'm gonna have you

591
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,220
take away three defensive opportunities

592
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,410
you can get from thinking in terms of

593
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,910
paths and the first one is you get to

594
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,610
pick where you want to meet the attacker

595
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,990
right if it's just a snap in time right

596
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,280
there's no point in there that you can

597
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,530
choose but if you think in terms of a

598
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,870
path you say maybe I want to stop the

599
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,490
attacker at the beginning of the path or

600
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,959
maybe I want to stop him in here when

601
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,970
he's kind of bouncing around inside my

602
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,370
organization you know if you think in

603
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:32,950
terms of paths you can start to think in

604
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,959
terms of what you want to stop on the

605
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,000
other hand this is where those short

606
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,309
paths become very important because

607
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,230
short paths you don't have as many steps

608
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:43,090
and when you look at the short path you

609
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,700
see some patterns you see the air as you

610
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,678
see the social attacks you see the

611
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,700
credential use in fact you also see a

612
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,190
couple other things that are almost

613
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,960
never seen in big attack you big attacks

614
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,360
or long attacks are almost never heirs

615
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,190
they rarely involve misuse they rarely

616
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,629
are physical those attacks happen very

617
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:04,179
quickly always now this gets into the

618
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:07,300
second thing you can do to defend using

619
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:09,340
paths and that is that you want to make

620
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,320
the path longer for the attacker because

621
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,310
the attackers want short paths right

622
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,980
the vast majority

623
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,450
attacks are short paths only fear out

624
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,680
here in a lot of steps and so that every

625
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,660
time you think about that really fancy

626
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,070
attack whether they came in and that

627
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,660
they use the owner ability and then they

628
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,340
pivoted to domain admin and then they

629
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,980
search for that thing that happens like

630
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:31,810
that amount and the reason is because

631
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,920
those kinds of attacks don't succeed a

632
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:37,450
lot right this is that story that the

633
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,960
attackers we've already always heard

634
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,600
right

635
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,430
that defenders have to be perfect every

636
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,990
time attackers only have to be perfect

637
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,450
get right once who's here heard that

638
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,920
right yeah we all heard that how many

639
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,660
people have heard the corollary which is

640
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,490
that attackers have to get every step in

641
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,550
their attack right defenders only have

642
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:57,130
to stop one of them if we heard that

643
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,720
much fewer but that's a whole point if I

644
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,510
can add a step in here if I can add two

645
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,910
factor authentication right that links

646
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,740
ins lengthens the path and it filters

647
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,940
out some of the people in the attack

648
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:12,190
assume then a substantial amount because

649
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,350
it's not about being perfect it's about

650
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,900
filtering some of the attackers out at

651
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,929
every step now the final thing that

652
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:24,100
final defensive opportunity you can take

653
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:25,570
from path data is this here these are

654
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,639
like the actions that happened at the

655
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,780
beginning of the attack and the ones

656
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,850
that happen in the middle and the ones

657
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,040
that happen at the end and what's

658
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,169
interesting is not at the top it's at

659
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,379
the bottom and so the least likely

660
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:40,120
action to start a breach is malware and

661
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,860
no this doesn't surprise anyone no one

662
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,510
goes like oh I just never realized that

663
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,800
malware has to come from somewhere but

664
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:47,590
it's not something we think about a lot

665
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,690
on the other hand malware is very often

666
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,010
in the middle of attack which obviously

667
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,150
these have to be like three steps you

668
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,670
don't have a middle if you don't have

669
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:56,500
three steps but now it's in the middle

670
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,660
and on the other side

671
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,640
social almost never ends an attack and

672
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,670
as a defender what that means is that

673
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,320
you can consider what you haven't seen

674
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,910
based on what you have so that's the

675
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,830
next defensive opportunity guessing what

676
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,830
you haven't seen based on what you do

677
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:16,360
see because if you are seeing a social

678
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,860
attack yep social you can probably guess

679
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,870
you're gonna see something else before

680
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,149
the end of the attack on the other hand

681
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,949
if you're seeing malware that probably

682
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,750
means you need to look back in time and

683
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,070
what happened before and the

684
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,990
were you look at your data hopefully you

685
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,120
will realize the more about what you see

686
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:34,600
leads to what happened before and after

687
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,879
the attack and then finally before I get

688
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,590
into the industries I want to talk about

689
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,880
something that we've talked about pass

690
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,310
but we really haven't talked about what

691
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,810
happens before the path and after the

692
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,909
path because in security we always focus

693
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,110
on the targets or on the actions on

694
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,990
target when don't talk about what

695
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:57,909
happens before and after them hmm excuse

696
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:59,050
me and so to think about that oh this

697
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,350
would look so much better if there was

698
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,030
color just pretend there are lots of

699
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,010
lines here like to say you want to

700
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,660
remember this chart from the report you

701
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,070
know I like that okay so you can look at

702
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,270
the report later and replace this in

703
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:15,760
your mental image with the actual figure

704
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:18,820
we looked at data from like criminal

705
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,230
forums and criminal marketplaces you

706
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,330
know that the quintessential dark web

707
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,950
and like I was expecting to get there

708
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,810
and to see like you know the Amazon of

709
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,070
evil like you know you're like I want

710
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,800
ransomware and it pops up a bunch

711
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:32,620
options and good ratings and such and it

712
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,970
was not that it's like listening like it

713
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,290
was depressing honestly because I was

714
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:39,130
looking for something cool and what I

715
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:42,070
got was the equivalent of 15 year-olds

716
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,620
chatting over like some video game live

717
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:47,710
chat it is like that level of quality

718
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,120
and so you know I'm looking for a lot of

719
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,560
malicious stuff right I'm looking for

720
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,629
the attackers kind of trading stuff and

721
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,460
preparing their attacks and using the

722
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,510
services they need to set up something

723
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,640
up and when I got was lots of drugs that

724
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:03,580
is what they're being used for is lots

725
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,410
and lots of trading drugs and I ended up

726
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,270
after you filter out you know this huge

727
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,890
list it took hours to get all the drug

728
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,560
references out and then what we got to

729
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:14,590
was just a little bit this it's like the

730
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,139
vast majority of content on these

731
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,820
criminal forums was around trading bank

732
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,570
information either credit card

733
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,760
information or payment payment accounts

734
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,310
and bank accounts there were only two

735
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,840
things that stood out the first was a

736
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,870
little cluster over here around accounts

737
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,500
so VPN accounts or proxy accounts but

738
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:37,750
also like online video type accounts so

739
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,760
services you pay for video movies or

740
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,030
such but

741
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,790
the the family-friendly kind and and the

742
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,920
adult kind there was lots of that going

743
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,960
on and then the final thing that we saw

744
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:53,220
a little bit was buy a purchase and sale

745
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,840
of new phones and the reason is because

746
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,630
new phones are a great way to launder

747
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,330
money if you're attacking so the

748
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,890
attackers will maybe use personal

749
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,270
information you buy if they want to cash

750
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,400
out personal information that they

751
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,350
stolen so they bike phones on someone

752
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,300
else's credit but now those phones are

753
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,370
kind of sketchy and so they can go and

754
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,620
they can sell them here and that helps

755
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:18,030
them launder the money on the other side

756
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:20,520
there's people with with dirty money who

757
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,680
you know maybe want to launder that and

758
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,379
get phones and so it turns out there's a

759
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,140
robust trade in phones on these credit

760
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,610
on these sites as well now the other

761
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,370
thing we looked at that happens before

762
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,840
and after breach is data from the FBI

763
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:37,169
and this was really good because you

764
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,850
know we try to talk when the FBI

765
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,530
presents they talk about you know if

766
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,790
it's something like five billion dollars

767
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,129
lost a business email compromised over

768
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:46,920
the last couple years but we're trying

769
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,480
to report on what happens to the the

770
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,060
normal company and what happens to the

771
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,480
normal company is it not a lot is lost

772
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,540
right the normal amount is I think eight

773
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,950
thousand for a computer database and 24

774
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,110
thousand this is what the attacker takes

775
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,580
and so what that means is that the

776
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,840
majority of your cost when you have a

777
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,100
breach is not going to come from what

778
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,020
the attackers stole more than likely

779
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,429
it's going to come from incident

780
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,960
response and it's going to come from

781
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,360
outside legal counsel and that's from

782
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,030
the 2016 report and so if you're an

783
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,010
organization plan for those costs those

784
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,020
are the ones to go around bite you and

785
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,300
additionally if you do have a business

786
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,610
email compromised when the u.s. when the

787
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,110
ic3 recovery asset team acts upon a

788
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,659
business email compromised and works

789
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:30,240
with the destination bank half of all us

790
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,130
being us-based business email

791
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,630
compromised victims have 99 percent or

792
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,880
more of their money recovered or frozen

793
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:38,670
and only nine percent had nothing

794
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,130
recovered you know what that means is

795
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:43,590
that it's not over even if a business

796
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,970
email compromise happens right don't

797
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,679
just like throw in the towel

798
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,890
in fact this happened just like last

799
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,050
week there was like a big phishing email

800
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,530
led to a business email compromised the

801
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,320
organism

802
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,480
like I think 2.1 million or something

803
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,179
and the news article said they expect to

804
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,460
get it all back and the reason is

805
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,230
because if you work with law enforcement

806
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,360
law enforcement will go to the bank and

807
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,860
go hey you just maybe hold on to that

808
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,669
money a little bit longer before you

809
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,320
send it anywhere else

810
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,390
and because we want to really figure out

811
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,669
maybe where it came from and they freeze

812
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,990
the money and then eventually it gets

813
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,000
transferred back to you if the money

814
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:22,200
that gets stolen from you goes to a bank

815
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,900
you still have the ability to act and so

816
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,340
now let's talk about industries and this

817
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,230
is I'm going to pretty much breeze

818
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,730
through the industries because there's a

819
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,110
couple of size for each but the reality

820
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,760
is no one cares about any industry but

821
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,500
their own and so there's gonna be like

822
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,110
one side that you care about and then

823
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,000
like you know 20 sides that you couldn't

824
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,649
care less about but will try to hit kind

825
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,330
of high points for several of the

826
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,460
industries I'm also going to show you

827
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,590
like the paths for each of the industry

828
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,620
just kind of get a visible view of what

829
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,060
happens here in accommodation food

830
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,739
services they have a lot of hacking and

831
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:56,070
malware right these look like the

832
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,890
advanced attacks and they are I'm also

833
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,060
gonna show you the most common paths

834
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:02,220
here the most compact was hacking

835
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:04,230
leading to confidentiality and the

836
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,970
leading to malware leading to malware

837
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,980
breaching confidentiality and the reason

838
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,450
is because accommodation and food

839
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,480
services has a huge problem with

840
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:14,010
point-of-sale breaches in fact they're

841
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,870
almost all discovered by fraud detection

842
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,280
which is common point of presence where

843
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,739
which is where the credit card company

844
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,850
calls you and says hey everyone that

845
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,390
purchased anything from your

846
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:26,580
organization on you know Thursday has

847
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,470
had fraudulent transactions we think you

848
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,550
may have a breach you know which is not

849
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,760
how you want to find out about your

850
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:34,080
breaches this happens a lot in

851
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,510
accommodation than the food services and

852
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,280
what it means is that those types of

853
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,629
organizations need to go and protect

854
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,770
their point-of-sale systems and they

855
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,680
also need to get better at detecting

856
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,720
these types of attacks next moving on to

857
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Education this one you can tell compared

858
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,080
to the other one it's a little more

859
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,480
diverse there's more going on but here

860
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,949
the most common path our air is leading

861
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,730
to a breach of confidentiality and this

862
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,870
is going to be something you're gonna

863
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:59,220
see a lot in this now education is a bit

864
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,530
different it's a little bit interesting

865
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,060
they've had a little bit of a drop in

866
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,830
espionage there used to be a lot of

867
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,789
espionage here now it's more financially

868
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,158
driven but these

869
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:09,899
still have a lot of air slightly more

870
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,999
than one-third of the breaches were due

871
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,988
to human air right and this is going to

872
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:15,029
be something right and come back because

873
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:17,340
we talked about air causes a lot of

874
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:20,669
breaches but we don't really appreciate

875
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,529
that also one of the things that was

876
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:24,299
surprising here is if you read the

877
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:27,330
report like last year we saw a lot of

878
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:29,759
especially in 2017 we saw a lot of w-2

879
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,439
fraud where the attackers would still w2

880
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,019
Farbs and they file fraudulent tax

881
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,489
returns and that's like dried up it

882
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:38,009
happened like it was like 20% of

883
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:40,049
breaches in education and we saw none of

884
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:41,759
that this year acrost anything but we

885
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:44,369
don't know why

886
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,629
moving on finance is a really

887
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,999
interesting one again you can see it

888
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:49,168
kind of bounces around but again error

889
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:51,419
leading to breaches to confidentiality

890
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:54,450
of the most common attack a common

891
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:56,129
attack path now one of the unique things

892
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,019
is we get a lot of data and this we

893
00:31:56,129 --> 00:32:00,509
don't include in the main corpus because

894
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:02,249
it would bias the whole thing you just

895
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,710
like if you had 40,000 breaches right

896
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:05,879
that's all you'd see in every stat but

897
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,009
this is all botnet data

898
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:09,658
this is breaches where a bot takes over

899
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,979
an account and then compromises the

900
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:13,259
financial institution through its

901
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:15,840
customers and it applies to other things

902
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:18,269
information technology companies have

903
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,189
some similar problems but the vast

904
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,849
majority of it is financial institutions

905
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:25,919
and this is compared to payment card

906
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:27,840
system that breaches in financial which

907
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,389
are kind of going down Islands so this

908
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,119
is going down this is really big and

909
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:34,709
what that means is if you're a financial

910
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,678
institution you need to worry less about

911
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:39,690
payment card breaches so skimmers on

912
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,879
ATMs and such and a lot more about

913
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,470
credentials the attackers are no longer

914
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:45,478
really going after the credit cards

915
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,820
they're going after the credentials that

916
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:49,710
let them in to your customers accounts

917
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,939
and so if your financial institution you

918
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,139
need to do a lot to protect your

919
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,229
customers because that's what the

920
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:56,369
attackers are coming after moving on to

921
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:58,679
healthcare and healthcare has a really

922
00:32:56,369 --> 00:33:00,658
diverse set of breaches because they

923
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,840
kind of operated like a little city they

924
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:05,070
have utilities they have financial

925
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,488
organizations they have health care they

926
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:12,210
have IOT devices they have all the

927
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:13,889
different parts at retail still air

928
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,690
leading to confidentiality was the

929
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:17,189
biggest path in fact they have to report

930
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,409
a mandatory reporting for these kinds of

931
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,240
things so it was very large

932
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:23,340
now if you're in healthcare the big

933
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,720
thing that is interesting healthcare is

934
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,580
that there's a one industry that has

935
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,830
more internal breaches in external and

936
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,899
that's due to two things the first is

937
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:33,210
errors we talked about how errors are

938
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:35,309
very big particularly in healthcare but

939
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,600
they also have a lot of misuse because

940
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:38,580
you have a lot of people who have access

941
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,139
to this sensitive internal data and some

942
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,549
of them are using it for malicious

943
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:43,199
purposes they're stealing healthcare

944
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:45,418
records to go file fraudulent health

945
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,710
returns some of them are stealing

946
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:49,110
because they're just curious there was a

947
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,879
breach we recorded where it was like one

948
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,459
of these major you know accidents it

949
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:56,490
injured several people and then like

950
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,740
several months later they indicted

951
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,539
several of the healthcare workers and

952
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,860
fire them because it turned out a bunch

953
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,539
of health care workers were going in and

954
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,918
accessing the people that were there

955
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:08,609
medical records of the people that were

956
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,649
involved in the accident right for note

957
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:12,899
with no legitimate reviews and so

958
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:14,279
internal actors are very important in

959
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:18,328
health care and it's both due to err and

960
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:21,060
misuse on the other hand moving on to

961
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:22,560
information this again is air leading

962
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,940
confidentiality because information

963
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,889
companies by the way information

964
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,240
companies are like all your technology

965
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,129
companies you would think out like if

966
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,598
you got the drop down you have

967
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:31,980
industries and it says technology that's

968
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,510
where most the information Corp

969
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,520
companies think of so all the big

970
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,530
internet companies that such but again

971
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,960
these internet information companies are

972
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,599
using cloud services and such and so

973
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,010
they have a lot of errors due to that

974
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,780
misconfigured storage that exposes

975
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:50,399
credentials and such and databases or

976
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,500
file stores now here internal actors

977
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:58,950
were still pretty big and this again is

978
00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:01,710
due to err ear leading air from this

979
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,328
configuration so if you're in if you're

980
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,130
in information the first thing is to

981
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:06,750
look at where your airs are coming from

982
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:10,770
and how those are leading to breaches on

983
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:13,190
the next one though is 29% breaches and

984
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:16,650
information we're due to cyber espionage

985
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:19,170
and 22% stole secrets and so while the

986
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,589
information industry has a substantial

987
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,790
air issue they also have a lot of

988
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:27,119
corporate espionage stealing internal

989
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,619
secrets as well moving the manufacturing

990
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,000
which I always like manufacturing cuz

991
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,740
you're like why would manufacturing ever

992
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,220
breach like what you know they're not

993
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,879
the

994
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,730
like steel but there's a little bit here

995
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,920
and it's they actually have misuse being

996
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:45,290
a confidentiality one main point it used

997
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:48,480
to be that the big thing in

998
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:51,000
manufacturing was espionage so corporate

999
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,670
espionage stealing secrets but now it's

1000
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,290
a little bit different it's more

1001
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,599
financially motivated but the path is

1002
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,609
still the same is still fishing leading

1003
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,040
to our leading to the loss of internal

1004
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:03,869
data and secrets still if I were a

1005
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,240
manufacturing organization I would worry

1006
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:07,590
substantially about the employees I have

1007
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,910
because I've got probably got healthcare

1008
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,160
information on them I've probably got

1009
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,348
certainly tax information certainly

1010
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,690
personal information and I probably have

1011
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:17,280
a large body of workers and there is

1012
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,800
value in their data that data can be

1013
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,650
directly turned into money and so we saw

1014
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,420
w-2 for tax on manufacturing last year

1015
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,109
it wouldn't surprise me if we saw those

1016
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,010
and other types of attacks on the future

1017
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:32,960
professional services who in here is a

1018
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:35,130
consultant if you this this is you

1019
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,300
professional services is all the things

1020
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,490
we do those kinds of things

1021
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,560
and here again air leading to breach of

1022
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,629
confidentiality was the most common but

1023
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,339
a big part here was business email

1024
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,730
compromises right

1025
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:49,080
this is numeration x' and fraudulent

1026
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,730
transactions and there were 41

1027
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,970
fraudulent transactions out of this data

1028
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:57,480
set which is a pretty big portion of it

1029
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:59,520
low under half pretexting financially

1030
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,770
staff compromised right this is all

1031
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,630
business email compromised these are

1032
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,869
attacker is compromising credentials

1033
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,310
emailing the CFO asking for money and

1034
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:09,950
getting it because you know what better

1035
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,540
way to get money than to ask for it

1036
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,399
there also it's been an increase in

1037
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,690
personal information credentials being

1038
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,720
breached and some of that can be

1039
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,849
attributed to the business email

1040
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,098
compromises but not all of it because

1041
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:25,200
54% of breaches involve the theft of

1042
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,490
internal information or secrets all

1043
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,598
right you're seeing time of pattern here

1044
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,098
there's a lot of error but there's also

1045
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,920
a lot of theft of internal secrets

1046
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,420
across the industries so we got two more

1047
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,940
left

1048
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:39,089
the first one is government the next one

1049
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,040
is going to be retail and so again

1050
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:44,370
government has mandatory reporting so

1051
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:48,600
air is in the most common attack path

1052
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:50,250
in public administration but they have

1053
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,650
something that the other is done which

1054
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:57,090
is this really big and actually a big

1055
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,800
jump up character it's a cyber espionage

1056
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,150
and they the thing that worries me is

1057
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,010
that the majority of their breaches

1058
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:07,140
takes years to discover like what would

1059
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,810
you say if your organization took years

1060
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:13,950
to discover most of its breaches right

1061
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:16,520
like this is a little bit disturbing and

1062
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,899
so if you're in public administration

1063
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,340
you need to realize that you're being

1064
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,590
targeted but you definitely need to

1065
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,120
improve your detection and actually next

1066
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,520
year I expect to see that we'll see this

1067
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,910
big uptick that's gonna go down next

1068
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,620
year and not for any good reason and

1069
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,779
instead days and maybe even hours is

1070
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,609
going to go up because of so much

1071
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,160
ransomware that we're seeing in the

1072
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:39,590
public sector happening this year that

1073
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,430
will go into the next year's corpus a

1074
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,350
finally retail which is one of the

1075
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,970
funner ones here they actually have

1076
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,520
physical breaches compromising

1077
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:49,589
confidentiality as the most common path

1078
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,840
and so that's like credit card skimmers

1079
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:54,750
which you know isn't surprising that

1080
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,290
retail has a skimmer issue but a bigger

1081
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:01,320
thing is what we see here because the

1082
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:03,930
reality is a card pressing crime or you

1083
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,480
know crime where it was not a web server

1084
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,810
that was compromised is going down and

1085
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,340
this is data from the the ncfd a

1086
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,799
national cyber forensics and trainee

1087
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,740
Alliance and then our internal corpus

1088
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,560
and we're seeing this inversion where

1089
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:23,339
breaches related to brick and mortar

1090
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,779
attacks are going down and online retail

1091
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,690
attacks are increasing that's probably

1092
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,850
due to a couple reasons first we now

1093
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:33,120
have chip and signature in the US and so

1094
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:36,740
that actually is having an effect next

1095
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:40,680
we've seen some known vulnerabilities in

1096
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:42,779
online retail software credit card

1097
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,690
processing software and anyone that

1098
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,520
didn't patch those is getting breached

1099
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,860
and also like every year we normally

1100
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,540
have these big multi victim

1101
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,830
point-of-sale breaches where the

1102
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,440
attackers attack like a point-of-sale

1103
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,230
vendor and then they use that access to

1104
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,850
attack everyone

1105
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,800
the customers in breach all those points

1106
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,150
sale systems and that results in a lot

1107
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,369
of companies having point-of-sale

1108
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,310
breaches and we didn't have any of those

1109
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:07,810
last year though even as we were writing

1110
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,820
the report one came in that'll be in

1111
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:13,200
next year's report but in general we've

1112
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,490
got this big trend we're in retail you

1113
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,609
now need to start worrying a lot about

1114
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:21,069
your online retail because it is

1115
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:24,970
becoming the trend versus in-store

1116
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:26,109
point-of-sale breaches and so that I'm

1117
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,368
gonna wrap it up and I'll have a little

1118
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:30,069
bit of time for questions here at the

1119
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:33,250
end which will be nice what I want you

1120
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:35,380
to take away from this presentation is I

1121
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:38,530
want you to think how you balance cost

1122
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,060
and risk and so we're going to talk

1123
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:43,060
about three types of organizations this

1124
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,890
videos the first are the types of

1125
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,440
organizations that can't afford any of

1126
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:50,710
their own security like you know my

1127
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,440
dentist doesn't have his own security

1128
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,090
staff computer security staff the local

1129
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,910
liquor store in my little three stop

1130
00:40:55,090 --> 00:41:00,400
light town doesn't have you know a knock

1131
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:02,950
of its own but there are things that

1132
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,330
they can do right because the liquor

1133
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,890
store doesn't have owned its

1134
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,470
point-of-sale system it leases it and

1135
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,819
that point sale vendor can then contract

1136
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:13,049
and either have their own knock or have

1137
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,170
an MSSP to provide the security my

1138
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,730
dentist

1139
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,440
he owns those computers but he doesn't

1140
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:19,119
own the software on him he leased us all

1141
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,920
that it's all managed by another company

1142
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,880
that can then provide them security as

1143
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,460
well so if you're a small organization

1144
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,859
or if you're making recommendations of

1145
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:30,130
small organizations recommend that they

1146
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:32,080
get involved in purchasing services that

1147
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:36,070
where they can access economies of scale

1148
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,930
when it comes to security the next is

1149
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,369
probably where most of us fit and these

1150
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,080
are organizations that can afford

1151
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:43,630
security and if you can afford to

1152
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,069
mitigate something mitigate the four

1153
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,380
horsemen's us here eighty-five percent

1154
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:49,920
solution right do we remember what they

1155
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:54,820
are what was the first one anyone good

1156
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:58,180
what's the second one heirs third social

1157
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:00,430
great fourth great you guys paid

1158
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,109
attention I am so excited by that like

1159
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,399
yeah it's like two o'clock in the

1160
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:05,049
afternoon we've eaten we're kind of

1161
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,980
coasting down like you know we're think

1162
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,930
about what we're going to do tonight I

1163
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,829
appreciate you guys paying attention and

1164
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,629
so what you need to do about that

1165
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:13,160
is patcher externally facing

1166
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,299
vulnerabilities like the old and easy

1167
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,430
ones

1168
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:18,979
gracefully degrades so the airs don't

1169
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:22,549
cause breaches right away have a

1170
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:24,979
secondary process for verifying money

1171
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:26,599
transfers than anything above the level

1172
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:29,660
that you're legitimately willing to lose

1173
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:31,130
a lot lose repeatedly and also all the

1174
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,808
fishing stuff that we know how to do and

1175
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,249
finally have to factor in education the

1176
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:36,109
other things we do about credentials and

1177
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:39,589
then and this is where the discussion

1178
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:41,209
gets a little bit awkward because I'm

1179
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:43,130
going to tell you that most people in

1180
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:47,509
here should probably not invest after

1181
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:50,479
that instead you know you may be better

1182
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:53,059
off going and finding the local branch

1183
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:55,129
of federal law enforcement no but

1184
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:57,700
there's a decent FBI office here in town

1185
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:00,440
and I bet they know a lot about security

1186
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,089
and your best bet for dealing with the

1187
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,209
advanced threats may be to get to know

1188
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:06,769
them early so that they can help you

1189
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:09,229
because the reality is to deal with

1190
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:11,419
advanced threats you need to invest a

1191
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:13,899
lot and it doesn't make sense to invest

1192
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,849
half way in stopping advanced threats

1193
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,349
because once you stop those there's

1194
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:20,589
obvious attacks those are the attackers

1195
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:24,019
who will try one thing and if it fails

1196
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:26,359
they'll leave the advanced threats if

1197
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:27,979
you try if you if they try to send one

1198
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:30,019
thing and you stop them they're gonna

1199
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:31,308
try a second thing and so the only way

1200
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:32,868
you can defeat those guys is if you

1201
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,849
price them completely out of the market

1202
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:36,979
and that means you can't stop one path

1203
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:38,180
you have to stop 20 different things

1204
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:39,468
they could do because they can't you

1205
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,910
can't leave them any path to move

1206
00:43:39,469 --> 00:43:43,249
forward through the attack graph and

1207
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,690
that's expensive and it's hard and you

1208
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:45,979
have to commit to that entire thing and

1209
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,499
some organizations are willing to do

1210
00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:49,939
that right there are organizations that

1211
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:51,379
sign blank checks to their security

1212
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,670
department because they want that to

1213
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,619
happen because it's critical to the

1214
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,229
business you know and if that's your

1215
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:59,059
organization by all means do that but

1216
00:43:57,229 --> 00:44:01,308
know what you're getting into be

1217
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:02,599
prepared for that kind of investment you

1218
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:04,489
know that might be a hundred million

1219
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,079
dollar a year investment depending on

1220
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:07,640
the size of your organization and you

1221
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,619
might not see returns on it right

1222
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,839
because until you've implemented all

1223
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:14,150
those protections until you can operate

1224
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,400
your security of that you know advanced

1225
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,930
level you know you're still going to

1226
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,999
lose it's like if a team tried to move

1227
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:21,190
up from the minor leagues to the majors

1228
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:22,930
right even

1229
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,460
they were really good and even if they

1230
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,720
had all the support in the world it's

1231
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,760
gonna take them a while before they

1232
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,129
start winning games and the same thing

1233
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,230
applies to your organization but if you

1234
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:34,210
want to be that good organization if you

1235
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,700
wanted to feed those advanced threats

1236
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,950
you know by all means commit and do it

1237
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,180
and no matter what kind of organization

1238
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,368
you are whether you're a large

1239
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,290
organization or a small one the most

1240
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:46,300
important thing is that you just do

1241
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:49,869
something because every little bit helps

1242
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:53,349
you not be the easiest target and so

1243
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:54,819
with that I'll put up the cool side that

1244
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:56,319
you can take a picture of again all

1245
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:58,779
those lists about things that you could

1246
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,420
do and the path stuff and such is on

1247
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,859
here and I have like five minutes for

1248
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,500
questions that's very good normally I

1249
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:07,029
just like run my entire time out so if

1250
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:21,490
you have any questions this is up your

1251
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:23,680
opportunity to ask let's see yeah so the

1252
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:26,979
question was have we seen an uptick in

1253
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,899
deep fade technology and wow I have seen

1254
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,300
news articles they claim that such a

1255
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,970
thing happened I have not seen any

1256
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,829
evidence at all that it has happened at

1257
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:37,959
all because like it was claimed that

1258
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:42,010
happened but there was no clear evidence

1259
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:49,690
to prove that claim any other questions

1260
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:51,640
I saw one over here yeah oh you know

1261
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:55,089
I'll be honest I don't remember it from

1262
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:57,549
the others and because we operate so

1263
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:59,170
much on aggregate data that like the

1264
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,180
only things that even stick with us are

1265
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,589
like the funny interesting ones or once

1266
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:06,460
they are used to make a point about the

1267
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:08,710
aggregate data yeah but you know my

1268
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,060
guess is it's just one I probably wasn't

1269
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,619
the one that put it into the data set

1270
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:15,069
and so I may never have even seen it in

1271
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:16,599
individually but those kinds of things

1272
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:18,520
happen like there are attacks where you

1273
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:20,500
haven't a lot of times in fact it's hard

1274
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,849
to see on this chart but in the advanced

1275
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,530
attacks you saw a lot where there was

1276
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:24,970
just an unknown action to start and what

1277
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,950
we really see a lot of in advanced

1278
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:29,109
attacks is that once you get past a

1279
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:31,089
certain point there is no record of what

1280
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:32,500
happened before it and so you only like

1281
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:34,630
pick up the attack here and you know

1282
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,120
stuff happened before it but if you

1283
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,280
don't

1284
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,380
like if you don't catch it before it's

1285
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,210
gotten to its fifth or at 6:07 step you

1286
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,040
lose the records about how they got in

1287
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,450
you know which also means it's hard to

1288
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,150
determine whether you got them out and

1289
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:51,109
so this is another reason to be very

1290
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:53,240
careful about not key about losing

1291
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:55,070
visibility on advanced attacks if you're

1292
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:59,680
going to be planning on mitigating those

1293
00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:14,000
types of attacks any other questions

1294
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:16,940
back to the room supply chain it would

1295
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,590
depend how the attack happened when we

1296
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,810
talked about partners it means that like

1297
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:22,130
your partner was evil it doesn't mean

1298
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,380
that the attack came through the partner

1299
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:27,680
that said a lot of times we code

1300
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:30,500
secondary victims and so if you know the

1301
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,120
attack was on a certain organization but

1302
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:37,040
it was then used to compromise another

1303
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:40,130
organization we try to code those but we

1304
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,220
see a lot where like two organizations

1305
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:45,140
are involved like an example from last

1306
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,600
week and by the way if you're ever

1307
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:49,819
interested I try to stream Tuesdays and

1308
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:53,750
Thursdays of us coding like the public

1309
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:55,040
data set VC DB into like I look up a

1310
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,960
news article and then you can watch me

1311
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,509
on Twitch turn that into structured data

1312
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,530
and then I put them on YouTube so people

1313
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,480
can go back and look because I want

1314
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:03,830
other people to be able to do this so

1315
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,660
that other organizations can analyze

1316
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:10,370
their own data but one of the ones we

1317
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:16,819
saw last week was where it was like a

1318
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:20,180
company had had one of their not other

1319
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:21,710
customers one of their suppliers or

1320
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,319
someone that provide a service forum had

1321
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,670
access to the company's data and it was

1322
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,020
breached and that therefore but it gets

1323
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,940
counted against whoever the biggest

1324
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,230
company in the chain is right because it

1325
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,390
doesn't make a good news article if you

1326
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:34,700
just talk about you know some like minor

1327
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:37,580
service that no one knows about and so

1328
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,290
it was called the bigger company we also

1329
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:41,120
saw one where two companies were working

1330
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,800
together and then their service kind of

1331
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:46,040
got breached and then there was in fact

1332
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,720
one enough Facebook one where like

1333
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,680
Facebook didn't even get breached but

1334
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,509
someone had been scraped

1335
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,069
email or phone numbers off of Facebook

1336
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,809
stored him in like a MongoDB database

1337
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:56,000
and put it on the Internet

1338
00:48:53,809 --> 00:49:01,190
and someone looked it up on you know

1339
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,829
showed an and found it and you know no

1340
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,390
one says hey this random Internet sir we

1341
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:07,190
don't even know who runs this you know

1342
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,259
website or this server got briefs they

1343
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:12,020
all say Facebook I've reached and so a

1344
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:14,450
lot of times it's very ambiguous who

1345
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,950
really should be counted responsible for

1346
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:19,279
the breach now if you're talking about

1347
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:22,308
supply chain in terms of like kind of an

1348
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:25,819
advanced threat you know like

1349
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:27,559
compromised the like I guess the

1350
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:29,150
quintessential one would be like the one

1351
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,900
where the defense one where they

1352
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:35,720
compromised the third level down

1353
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:37,339
subcontractor they got the CEOs son who

1354
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:40,430
also used the laptop to download some

1355
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:45,950
malware that was used to con compromised

1356
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:49,640
the data of the contractor who is fused

1357
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:52,790
today it compromised the data of the of

1358
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,640
the actual of DoD and these several

1359
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,529
steps and that happened like several

1360
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,650
years ago but the reality is that's not

1361
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:02,210
the easy path for the attackers right

1362
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,829
they want the easy path and so if they

1363
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,450
have to do that an event a few of the

1364
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:07,160
events attackers will do that the

1365
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:09,919
majority of them are just going to email

1366
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,808
the main target and go hey would you

1367
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,230
download this and run it and someone's

1368
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,230
going to do it
