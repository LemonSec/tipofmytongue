1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
very least within 50 minutes so my name

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,000
is cliff and this is everything I

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,709
learned about InfoSec everything I

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,760
needed to know about InfoSec I learned

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,780
from gambling I'll figure out what the

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,309
title is eventually so I am almighty

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,130
general it's like a lot of people here

8
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm an info set guy I'm an attacker I'm

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,930
a programmer I'm a system admin I used

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,750
to be a lawyer and I am a a games and

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,480
puzzles 'if that includes card games

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,509
board games puzzle games anybody ever

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,180
played the Talos principle for example

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,309
anybody one we got one all right very

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,140
good if you understand that if you

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,390
played that game you know the kind of

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,579
stuff I like and you know why I think

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,579
there's beauty in games and puzzles and

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,440
in and in breaking them so why on earth

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,420
are we here talking about gambling about

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,129
casino gambling we're gonna be talking

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,050
about advantage players people who

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,000
legally wrest the advantage back from

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,459
the casino to make money we're gonna be

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,969
talking about cheaters and thieves do

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,309
not try this at home please do not and

27
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,080
if you do I ain't liable for it why are

28
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,048
we talking about this in an info second

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,020
of all places well first of all it's fun

30
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,580
okay if you don't want to have fun at 4

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,130
o'clock on a Saturday afternoon then

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,740
just go back to the office and leave a

33
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,600
stick in your butt second it gives me a

34
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,419
chance to wear my favorite thrift store

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,729
find in the world and it is only semi

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,479
ironically my favorite piece of clothing

37
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,640
in my closet but joking aside it is my

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,750
opinion and it to me this is very very

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,200
clear casino game protection is exactly

40
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,659
the same business as InfoSec this is not

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,720
a metaphor this is not an analogy it's

42
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,270
the same thing on one hand you have the

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,210
hackers the people who steal data you

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,429
have advantage players you have cheaters

45
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,070
who try to take the casinos money on the

46
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,860
other hand you have the Sox the network

47
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,740
defenders the system admins and the

48
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,140
dealers the pit bosses and the casino

49
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,390
surveillance rooms they are engaged in

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,130
the same war and the same fight and I

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,259
think it's good for hackers to be a

52
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,090
little bit familiar with casino gambling

53
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,919
if nothing else this is gonna sound a

54
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,940
little bit cheesy but to give you a

55
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,730
sense of wonder

56
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,590
what's possible to ruin it the things

57
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,109
that people get away with in casinos and

58
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,610
maybe to spark your imagination a little

59
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,130
bit about the things that you can do

60
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,500
whether you're on the attacking side or

61
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,850
the defensive side we're gonna be a lot

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,040
of little interesting lessons and

63
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,480
tidbits especially for the newbies who

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,340
are just trying to learn how to think

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,590
about security and how to approach

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,030
security problems and hopefully the

67
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,130
veterans in here will get in few new

68
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,600
ideas and maybe think about things from

69
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,519
a different perspective as well so here

70
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,519
is a list of some of the most common and

71
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,260
most popular games in a casino have

72
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,450
yourself a quick look one of these

73
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,049
things is not like the other and by that

74
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,609
I mean there is a categorical

75
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,830
fundamental mathematical difference

76
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,170
between that game and the rest of the

77
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,170
others on this list that makes it the

78
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:08,540
number one most talked about game in

79
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,209
terms in terms of legal advantage play

80
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:22,500
any thoughts

81
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:24,060
why blackjack anybody okay both of those

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,739
things are true blackjack is a game with

83
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,900
a very small house edge and you can

84
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,880
count cards but wait a minute now

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,970
counting cards how does that help you

86
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,950
why don't people keep track of what

87
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,080
cards have been dealt at PI Gow Poker

88
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,089
why don't people keep track of what dice

89
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:47,970
have been rolled at craps why is it any

90
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:48,959
different right because blackjack is a

91
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,330
game with the memory

92
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,760
blackjack hands are not independent

93
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,590
events at most casinos in the Midwest

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,299
you're gonna have a six-deck shoe which

95
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,580
means you've got six decks all stacked

96
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,950
up in a big plastic case that the dealer

97
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,750
deals out of if you keep track of which

98
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,299
cards have been dealt out of that shoe

99
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,670
you have information about which cards

100
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,400
are going to come out and as it turns

101
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,320
out that fact can be used to wrest the

102
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,670
advantage back from the house using card

103
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,950
counting and I'm going to teach you how

104
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,529
to do it step by step you could take the

105
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,209
information we discuss here practice for

106
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,599
a while and go into a casino and win

107
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,570
with very little other

108
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,730
research and reading so let's talk a bit

109
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,500
about the rules of blackjack as you may

110
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,110
know the game is about getting close to

111
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,360
21 without going over if you actually

112
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,390
study basic strategy though it's more

113
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,610
about figuring out how much risk you

114
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,260
need to take how likely the house is to

115
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,280
bust that makes you decide what you're

116
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,050
gonna do but we'll get to that in a

117
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,150
minute there are a lot of variations on

118
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,280
the rules to blackjack and I've

119
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,710
highlighted a few of the ones that are

120
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,690
the real source of the house advantage

121
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,390
first and most importantly if both sides

122
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,460
bust the player loses Wow

123
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:00,430
it says player wins on there that's one

124
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,700
error for you so if both sides bust the

125
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,170
house wins so if you draw 223 and the

126
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,820
house later bust their hand you still

127
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,640
lost their bet but the rest of these

128
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,860
rules change from casino to casino in

129
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,890
some casinos the house stands on a soft

130
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,110
17 in some casinos a blackjack which

131
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,750
isn't natural an ace and a face card or

132
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:23,050
a 10 only pays 6 to 5 instead of the

133
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,510
customary 3 to - blackjack aps never

134
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,910
ever play a 6 to 5 blackjack game that's

135
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,700
way too much of a bit of theft from the

136
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,950
casino sometimes the player can't split

137
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,990
repeatedly in some casinos you can tree

138
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,990
split aces and some casinos you can only

139
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,690
split two four hands instead of eight or

140
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,340
however many some casinos allow

141
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,050
surrendering which is where you give up

142
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,299
half your bet because you know you're at

143
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,920
a very big disadvantage and there are

144
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,020
other rules about when the house checks

145
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,580
their whole card for a blackjack because

146
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,229
if the house has a blackjack that ends

147
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,969
the hand and that can actually be both a

148
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,700
good and a bad thing that does affect

149
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,380
the house edge insurance is also an

150
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,750
important bet to understand for purposes

151
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,880
of advantage play if the house has an

152
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,880
ace up what do you get to do what

153
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,590
decision can you make take insurance

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,590
very good what does that mean though

155
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,330
yeah yeah basically so you put up an

156
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,180
additional bet equal to half of your bet

157
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,729
that side bet you're saying I think the

158
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,120
house has blackjack that insurance bet

159
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:27,400
pays two to one so in other words if the

160
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,590
house does have a blackjack you win the

161
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,840
insurance bet at two to one and you lose

162
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,820
your original bet so by investing that

163
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,080
half of bet half a bet you've hedged

164
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,340
against the possibility that the house

165
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,840
has blackjack

166
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,429
now a little bit of quick math how many

167
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:46,810
face cards are there in the deck out of

168
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:49,000
13 tens and face cards three face cards

169
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,850
in 110 they all count is 10 right that's

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,330
4 how many non 10 cards are there in the

171
00:06:51,850 --> 00:07:02,410
deck out of 13 9 is the ratio of 9 to 4

172
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:07,500
higher or lower than 2 to 1 higher

173
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:10,600
so is insurance a good better no so yeah

174
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,640
ok fair enough so insurance is a bet you

175
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,480
want to take if the house is at least a

176
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,520
two-to-one favorite to have blackjack

177
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,010
given that 9 to 4 ratio if the house has

178
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,020
an ace up is the house more or less

179
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,349
likely than a 2 to 1 underdog to have

180
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,240
blackjack less so insurance is a sucker

181
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,950
bet in the game with an infinite shoe or

182
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,350
a game where you're not counting cards

183
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,090
if you're counting cards there are times

184
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,560
when you want to take insurance so where

185
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,239
most people start lending blackjack is

186
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,340
with this basic strategy charts now

187
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,140
these are generic charts that are

188
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,270
designed to give you a general piece of

189
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,099
advice about how to play your hands if

190
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,299
you study these charts well and pick one

191
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,610
that's appropriate for the rules you're

192
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,060
playing on the house edge may be as low

193
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,680
as half a percent or even lower right so

194
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,720
blackjack starting out is actually a

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,820
pretty decent game if you like to gamble

196
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,530
and just to be explicit these charts

197
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,560
tell you when to stand you'll notice

198
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,429
that if the house has a 2 through 6 up

199
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,620
that means they're likely to have a

200
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,540
stiff which is a number between 12 and

201
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,430
16 those are hands that are very likely

202
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,790
to bust because if they draw a 10

203
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,380
they're over 21 you have to hit a lot of

204
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,580
your hands if the house has a 7 or

205
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,260
better because you got to make a pat

206
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,419
hand in order to beat the house they're

207
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,730
not likely a bust advice about when to

208
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:29,620
split do you split aces and eights yes

209
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:31,060
or no no do you split fives and tens you

210
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,380
don't split fives and tens and actually

211
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,059
I just agreed with whoever said no in

212
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,220
the crowd so you tricked me you always

213
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,890
split aces and eights because an ace is

214
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,570
a very good starting card and a soft

215
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,850
twelve is not that good an ace and

216
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,370
another ace is just a 12 12 is not a

217
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:47,470
great hand similarly 2 eights is just a

218
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,870
16 that's a bad hand that's a hand you

219
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,460
can't

220
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,410
hit with good likelihood anything bigger

221
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,840
than a five busts you by splitting

222
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,699
eights you have two hands that start out

223
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,890
at an eight you draw ten on that and

224
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,630
you're at 18 which is a decent hand so

225
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,860
by splitting that hand you actually

226
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,180
improve your chances of winning anyway

227
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,100
this is not about the details of

228
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,839
blackjack let's get to card counting

229
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,580
this is the high-low system there are

230
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,340
all kinds of card counting systems out

231
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,900
there but this one reflects two simple

232
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,480
facts about the math of the game if

233
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,790
there are lots of aces and tens in the

234
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,460
shoe that means the player is more

235
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,079
likely to hit a blackjack well if the

236
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:25,100
house can the house can make a natural -

237
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:28,700
why does that help the player why our

238
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,080
blackjack is good for the player well

239
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,900
because you win but the house can beat

240
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,580
you at the blackjack as well what rule

241
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,000
of blackjack makes this favorable for

242
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,100
the player not insurance no what happens

243
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,450
if the player has a natural and ace and

244
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:49,190
a 10 you don't lose but you get a three

245
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:51,380
to two bonus going back to these rules

246
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,180
blackjack paste 3 - how many people have

247
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,850
gambled in a casino before or do it at

248
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,739
least more than once in a blue moon

249
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,690
ok handful all right that blackjack

250
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,630
bonus is one of the big ways that the

251
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,280
player gets pieces of equity back from

252
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,510
the house that's a pretty and central

253
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,890
part of the math of blackjack

254
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,240
and we're not gonna make everybody

255
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,410
experts here this is a very quick

256
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,540
overview because we got other stuff to

257
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,800
talk about aces and tens make black

258
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,360
Jack's that's good for the player

259
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,459
because they get a three-to-two bonus

260
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,860
they get paid a time and a half on their

261
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,500
bet if they make a blackjack that's good

262
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,990
for the player two's through sixes are

263
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,030
bad cards to have in the shoe because

264
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,920
when the house has one of those ugly

265
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,740
hands like a 12 through 16

266
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,740
these small cards help the house make a

267
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,680
pat hand if the house has a number less

268
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,870
than 17 they have to keep hitting so you

269
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,689
want them to be hitting hands like 16s

270
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,550
where they're likely to bust so and

271
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,350
we're gonna go through this pretty

272
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,660
quickly if some of the details are a

273
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,280
little fuzzy that's okay so each card

274
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,550
has a value this is how the high-low

275
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,500
system reflects this mathematics every

276
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,250
card has a value any ace or 10 card is a

277
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,310
-1 a 7 through 9 is neutral that's a 0 a

278
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,800
2 through 6 is a plus

279
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,359
and so as you see the cards being dealt

280
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,670
on the layout in front of you you keep

281
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,470
track of the running count every card

282
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,229
that's dealt you start out a zero on a

283
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,590
new shuffle first card comes out if it's

284
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,360
an ace what's your running count minus

285
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,700
one if the next card is a - what's your

286
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,150
running count back to zero if the next

287
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,700
card is a six you're at one the next

288
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,920
card is in nine you're at you're still

289
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,870
at one exactly that's how you keep the

290
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,390
running count what's the value of a full

291
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,010
shoe if I count through six decks and I

292
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,420
keep track of every card and every card

293
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,080
is dealt out from the shoe what's my

294
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:40,479
running count gonna be at it's six decks

295
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,230
in this case I'll give you a hint it's

296
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,790
the same answer if there's only one deck

297
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,560
zero because there is exactly as many

298
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,540
aces and face cards and tens as there

299
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,599
are two through six --is this is what we

300
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,829
call a balanced count so once you have

301
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,870
the running count in your head and

302
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,220
you're keeping it accurately you have to

303
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,529
figure out what's called the true count

304
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,410
so let's say that you have a running

305
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:04,680
count of +10 we know that positive

306
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,240
counts correlate for the player are

307
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,229
advantageous for the player because of

308
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,360
these two reasons

309
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,810
Plus counts are better for the player

310
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,780
but if you have a +10 running count how

311
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,390
good is that for the player it depends

312
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,250
how many decks are left in the shoe

313
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,420
because if the count is +10 and only two

314
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,450
hands have been dealt there's still a

315
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,189
lot of cards left that +10 bias that

316
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,170
you've tracked in the shoe is diluted

317
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,880
over those five and a half decks that

318
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,949
are left in the shoe but let's say the

319
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,870
house has dealt out most of the cards in

320
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,150
there and there's only half a deck left

321
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,339
in the shoe and the count is plus six

322
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,589
the running count is plus six how good

323
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:43,510
is that for a player it's good because

324
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,950
that's a heavy bias towards aces and

325
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,010
face cards in the cards that are

326
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,589
remaining so the last thing that AP's

327
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,560
have to do in a casino is watch the

328
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,150
discard tray as the hat the cards are

329
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,279
collected and swept up from the layout

330
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,980
after every hand they get placed in this

331
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,290
tray so you have to be able to look at

332
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,660
this discard tray and estimate just

333
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:08,110
visually how many decks have been dealt

334
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,550
out subtract that number from the number

335
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,990
of decks that you know are in the shoe

336
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,219
and that's always advertised they'll

337
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,920
always tell you this is a

338
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,050
decorate that could double that game so

339
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,750
then knowing how many decks are left you

340
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,760
divide the running count by the number

341
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,610
of decks left and then you have the true

342
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,610
count that true count is an objective

343
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,980
measure of how biased the shoe is in

344
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,680
favor of the cards you want to be dealt

345
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,080
out and so when you correlate your bets

346
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,239
with the true count that's how you take

347
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,680
the advantage back from the casino if

348
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,810
you're betting ten dollars when the

349
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,630
count is zero or negative but betting

350
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,969
$100 when the true count is plus four

351
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,790
then you're making big bets when the

352
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,970
shoe is favorable and making small bets

353
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,760
when the house has a big advantage so

354
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,870
that is how blackjack can be beaten all

355
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:01,030
right that's the core of it hell yeah

356
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,700
let's do it let's go to the casino I

357
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,500
know quite a few in this town here's the

358
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,200
scary thing about it I actually have an

359
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,930
old friend who's a dealer and pit boss

360
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,970
at one of the casinos in town so if I

361
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,439
take this crew over there he'll know me

362
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,550
and he'll probably figure out that you

363
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,770
guys are up to something

364
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,150
so I'll steer you away from that casino

365
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,840
if you want to go count but in all

366
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:25,720
seriousness know this doing this in

367
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,640
practice in a casino playing basic

368
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,680
strategy correctly while you're doing

369
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,660
all this it's extremely difficult don't

370
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,790
go and try to do it tonight it takes a

371
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,410
lot of practice dead serious it takes a

372
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,780
lot of practice to learn people practice

373
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,670
for months and years to do this by the

374
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,170
way if you do all this how big of an

375
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:46,750
advantage do you think you have over the

376
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:48,910
house not that what is yours so the

377
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,340
house edge starts out at 0.5% or so

378
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,199
roughly if you do all this and you

379
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,490
correlate your your bets with the true

380
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,660
count how big of an advantage do you

381
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,660
think you can get back from the house

382
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,470
practically if that's all you're doing

383
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,210
you're somewhere in that range you're at

384
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,980
about half a percent to a percent and

385
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,590
there are some very important security

386
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,660
related things that modulate that that

387
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,850
advantage you have so let's pause here

388
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,640
and talk a little bit about InfoSec so I

389
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,130
as clear as mud is that math was I know

390
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,900
it illustrate something very important

391
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:24,430
about InfoSec and that is the way I

392
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:26,050
define hacking a blackjack AP hacks the

393
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,899
game

394
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,120
and I say that because a hacker as I

395
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:34,300
define the term is someone who uses deep

396
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,070
system knowledge blackjack aps advantage

397
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,490
players know the mathematics of

398
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,529
blackjack better than 99.99% of casino

399
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,300
dealers out there and better than quite

400
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:43,839
a few pit bosses and surveillance people

401
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,660
as well

402
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,899
- you violate the expectations of the

403
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,790
designer three you cause the target to

404
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,579
behave in an unexpected way or an

405
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,519
unintended way and number four you often

406
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:59,229
use deception to evade defenses and

407
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,070
remain undetected and get to do what you

408
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,480
do for a long time so card County was

409
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,550
popularized in a book published I

410
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,589
believe in 1968 called beat the dealer

411
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,750
by a mathematician named Edward Thorp

412
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:14,220
how do you think the casinos felt about

413
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:20,430
that book being published those wrong

414
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:23,589
the casinos loved it the reason why

415
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:26,319
exactly most people who think they can

416
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,579
do it can't do it they don't have the

417
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,170
deep system knowledge they don't

418
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,120
understand the math or they go into

419
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,160
gambler like thinking I'm on a streak I

420
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,839
want to push my bets up and you just saw

421
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,300
eight 10s on the previous hand the count

422
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,160
is back to zero and when you're dealing

423
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,689
with margins that's small small mistakes

424
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,520
like that can cause you to just bleed

425
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,610
away all the the expected value you've

426
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,160
built up through good play so that's the

427
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,930
definition of hacking as I as I describe

428
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,610
it and it's packing writ large is

429
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,979
something that can be done to any system

430
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,020
remember casino people both the

431
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,120
surveillance folks and the advantage

432
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,980
players and cheats do the same thing as

433
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,690
we do the technical stuff is just

434
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,319
different instead of code and buffer

435
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,329
overflows and you know MF 1701 zero

436
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,918
they're dealing with cards and chips and

437
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,290
dice and slot machines and security

438
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,640
cameras the processes they go through

439
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,490
the same here's a little more on card

440
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,459
counting another big trick in the APS

441
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:21,309
Arsenal is what we call bat counting or

442
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:25,110
walking anybody know where the name Wang

443
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:27,339
Ying comes from any of you gamblers now

444
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:28,928
one of the seminal works on blackjack

445
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,490
advantage play is called professional

446
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,610
blackjack and it was published under the

447
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,840
name Stanford Wang it's named after him

448
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,790
because he's one of the people who

449
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,220
popular popularized it in that book and

450
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,889
to do that you just

451
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,020
and at the table and don't play as soon

452
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,390
as a new shuffle happens you watch you

453
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,830
keep the running count and then when the

454
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,169
true count hits a certain threshold

455
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,899
you've decided when the true count hits

456
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:54,929
a plus 2 for example that's when you sit

457
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,429
down what that does is it sweeps away

458
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,890
all those hands you have to play at

459
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:02,010
minimum bets so you're only betting when

460
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:04,500
you have the edge anybody have an idea

461
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,049
of why that's a little bit of a dodgy

462
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:13,140
thing to do in practice or at least a

463
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:15,299
challenging thing to do it looks pretty

464
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,980
obvious and there there's some trickery

465
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:19,889
that you can do to make it a little bit

466
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,559
less obvious but it's it's a dangerous

467
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,240
thing to do so basic strategy deviations

468
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,370
you're gonna see a chart on the left

469
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,559
that include on the right pretend I know

470
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,469
my left for my right Jesus so on the

471
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,629
left here are in illustrious 18 these

472
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,309
are 18 basic strategy deviations you

473
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,559
remember those charts from before about

474
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,879
how you should play each hand and I know

475
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,700
you can't read this forgive me

476
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,220
these are 18 rules about what you should

477
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,740
do depending on how high or low the true

478
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,150
count is for example if you can read

479
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,659
that that's gonna say you should take

480
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,890
insurance when the true count is plus 3

481
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:55,080
that means that if the true count is

482
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,150
plus 3 and you see an ace up for the

483
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,620
dealer there enough 10s left in the deck

484
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,210
that it's worth it for you to buy

485
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,178
insurance that actually increases your

486
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:06,450
Evi another example down here tends

487
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,890
against a six you have a pair of two 10s

488
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,350
what do you have the option to do with

489
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,730
the pair in blackjack split them that

490
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,918
means you put down another bet and play

491
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,130
two different hands the splitting 10

492
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,620
sound like a good idea in general no

493
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,390
because you go from a 20 to a 10 and a

494
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,270
10 can be great and it can also be awful

495
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,950
you draw a 6 on that tenure in bad shape

496
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:28,340
but it's correct to split 10s against a

497
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,690
6 when the true count is at least 4

498
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,399
because you're very likely to just draw

499
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,650
another 10 and have a 20 on each of your

500
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,049
hands and the house is very likely to

501
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:42,600
flip up a 10 in the hole and just bust

502
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:44,940
it with another 10 so another another

503
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,469
important thing that that some blackjack

504
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,270
players do there are two kinds of team

505
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,020
play now who here is red bringing down

506
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:54,309
the house or has seen the movie 21

507
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,320
what am i gay okay few people have their

508
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:59,090
yeah well as I understand that the movie

509
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,980
butchered the facts I haven't seen it

510
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,510
but there's enough I read that there's

511
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,309
enough question about how accurate the

512
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,870
book is and how much he sensationalized

513
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:07,399
things with the purple chip laying on

514
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,739
the table in his apartment and all that

515
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,590
the movie is is fantasy from what I've

516
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,910
heard but so there are a lot of people

517
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,350
who play blackjack just pooling their

518
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,600
money we're gonna play and we're gonna

519
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,730
split each other's wins and losses there

520
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,300
are also people who play as a team in

521
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,740
the casino so you have one player who

522
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,270
just blends him at the crowd playing

523
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,000
basic strategy and betting table

524
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:33,320
minimums when they see a massive true

525
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,210
count what do you think they do if they

526
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,100
stand up and holler exactly they say hey

527
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:41,679
mister pittmoss I'm on a blackjack team

528
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:45,620
no they do a subtle signal might be this

529
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,660
might be this might be this but they

530
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,270
signal somebody who's often called a big

531
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,350
player to come over to the table that

532
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,720
person knows that there's a positive

533
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,280
count and often might have the count

534
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,320
surreptitiously told to them by the

535
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:04,760
signal err in bringing down the house

536
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:07,159
how do they do it okay

537
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,679
okay in the book they describe it as

538
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,630
using a code word so if the countess of

539
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,160
the running count is +8 they'll speak

540
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,690
the word eggs allowed because the eight

541
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,300
looks a number eight looks like two eggs

542
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,030
so the big player comes on with a high

543
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,620
positive count and starts out making 200

544
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:26,780
five hundred or a thousand dollar bets

545
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:28,459
this is a massive way to really leverage

546
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,649
the advantage you get from card counting

547
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,170
but you got to be careful

548
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,420
in some states if you're detected they

549
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,190
can indeed back you off as they say that

550
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,630
might be as simple as saying Miss Turner

551
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,950
your games too good for us we can't have

552
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,150
you playing blackjack anymore if you'd

553
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,760
like to sit down in one of our slot

554
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:46,370
machines you're welcome to back in the

555
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,260
sixties people actually there were

556
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,850
probably some instances where people got

557
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,590
the crap beat out of them in backrooms

558
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,389
but that's back when the days when most

559
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,330
of Vegas was controlled by mobsters like

560
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,610
Benny Binion for example in the state of

561
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,100
Missouri they cannot tell you you can't

562
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,168
pay back chip play blackjack anymore but

563
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,879
they can change the rules they can say

564
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:08,469
you can

565
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:10,539
enter mid shoe which prohibits a big

566
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:12,699
play either the signaling with teams or

567
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:14,649
back counting or walking in it's worth

568
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:16,539
pointing out that that style of team

569
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:18,758
play where you signal the big player to

570
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:20,979
come in that's that's perhaps the most

571
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:22,809
famous style of play but it's actually a

572
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:25,179
very small percentage of the blackjack

573
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,979
Advantage play that goes on most teams

574
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,299
actually just pull their money and

575
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:30,509
that's all they do they don't do all

576
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:34,569
that signaling incidentally in Missouri

577
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:37,479
this regulation enshrines in law that it

578
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:39,849
is not cheating to count cards they

579
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:41,319
can't arrest you it is a myth that it is

580
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:43,149
cheat that is cheating and illegal to

581
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,589
count cards in Missouri it's enshrined

582
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:48,369
in the regulations in the black and

583
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:51,668
white text however you can't do it with

584
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:53,589
the assistance of another person so

585
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:54,369
signaling may very well be a crime in

586
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:58,539
the state of Missouri

587
00:22:54,369 --> 00:23:01,269
so detection and cover this is a big

588
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:03,639
chunk of the blackjack advantage play

589
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:05,379
world we talked about that a lot already

590
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:07,329
we've discussed that in the surveillance

591
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:09,549
room one thing they will do just count

592
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:12,729
down the shoe with you card counting is

593
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:15,699
not some kind of arcane secret technique

594
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:17,469
that's known only to criminals and and

595
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:19,449
people who sit hunched over

596
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:21,519
blackjack layouts with the hoodie over

597
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:24,669
their head in basements somewhere the

598
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,319
surveillance rooms know all about it at

599
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,089
the world game protection conference in

600
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,269
Las Vegas they have competitions

601
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:32,769
sometimes as most conferences do we have

602
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:37,419
CTFs what do you think world game

603
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:39,190
protection does card counting

604
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:41,859
competitions there's a video on youtube

605
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,319
of the finals of their card counting

606
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:46,629
competition guy took a deck spread it

607
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,999
out counted through it and I think seven

608
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:50,619
and a half seconds or so they removed a

609
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:52,719
couple cards from the deck beforehand to

610
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:54,129
prove that he'd counted it correctly so

611
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:56,289
he went read through it in like seven

612
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:57,698
seconds he says it's plus one they

613
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:59,679
turned over the last three cards and he

614
00:23:57,699 --> 00:24:02,919
was correct there were two neutrals in a

615
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,349
- surveillance people know all about

616
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,679
this they share tradecraft just like we

617
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:07,448
do

618
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,489
dealers call things out in the pits

619
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:13,809
sometimes you ever heard anyone say

620
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:14,729
hitting a heart 18 or doubling a 14 or

621
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:17,170
anything like that

622
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:20,380
sometimes the dealers will verbally

623
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,790
out strange plays to the pit-boss sounds

624
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,120
a lot like something we might do isn't

625
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:26,620
it

626
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:28,719
they have analysis software as we talked

627
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,250
about briefly before what do you think

628
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,450
you do if you're an AP to avoid

629
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:38,700
detection what's the central trade-off

630
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:40,870
you have to consider sorry

631
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,450
just how well you play

632
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,510
there is almost no blackjack ap in the

633
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:49,750
world who will split tens but Cudi's it

634
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:52,780
is such a red flag no gambler is ever

635
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,790
gonna split tens only an AP a card

636
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,740
counter is gonna do that there are other

637
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,659
things like avoiding back counting and

638
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,070
all these other techniques that that are

639
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,710
so good so there's constantly a

640
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,480
trade-off of how good am I gonna be how

641
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:09,340
much of an Eevee am I going to earn and

642
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,410
how obvious I gonna be yeah basically

643
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,409
don't port scan everything or don't fire

644
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:17,500
every exploit you know so and attackers

645
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,940
have the same trade-off the noisier you

646
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,550
are the more likely you are to get

647
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,370
caught but the less noisy you are the

648
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:28,180
fewer techniques you have to rely on

649
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:30,850
it's the same thing so let's talk about

650
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,470
let's move away from the legal advantage

651
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,879
players and go to casino cheating so

652
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,440
first of all I need someone who would

653
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:41,260
like to play a dealer for me come on out

654
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,850
so the source from most of this material

655
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,440
about cheating comes from this book I'll

656
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,570
post book recommendations when I post

657
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,120
the slides if y'all like but we're gonna

658
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,429
demo 3 cheats here and all three of them

659
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,959
are talked about in exquisite detail on

660
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,490
this book it's American roulette by

661
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,370
Richard Marcus if you like this stuff

662
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,660
you've got to read this book so ya over

663
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:05,489
there are you writing me touching your

664
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:08,020
hand we do this is gently like that okay

665
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,220
so here's what we're gonna do this is

666
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,120
the first move I'm going to show you

667
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,980
there are three different things

668
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,169
demonstrated by this move the first one

669
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,970
is called the 2:05 by the way where did

670
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:19,480
the term past posting come from anybody

671
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:21,490
now came from horse-racing refers to

672
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,600
betting on a horse after it has gotten

673
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:29,830
past the post so the cheat that we are

674
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:33,668
going to show involves increasing a bet

675
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,049
after the bet has already won so you are

676
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,460
my deal what's your name again Scott

677
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,739
Scott we definitely met but I've

678
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:42,309
forgotten your name so alright pretend

679
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:44,110
that you are my dealer I am sitting here

680
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:46,210
at the leftmost position on the table

681
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:49,209
now watch for think about the detail

682
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,799
that goes into this this cheat all right

683
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,869
watch everything notice everything you

684
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,850
can and you watch everything you can as

685
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:56,949
well now I'm not a chip mechanic you're

686
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,539
gonna see me do the move alright my

687
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,149
hands don't move that fast I'm not dead

688
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:02,950
dexterous there's my bed there are the

689
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:06,719
other players bets pretend you just

690
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,720
busted your hand you need to pay us all

691
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:17,259
hey you paid me wrong I'm betting black

692
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:23,459
chips here you give me $15 what is this

693
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:23,460
crap come on baby come on pay me right

694
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:32,169
that would happen yeah alright thank you

695
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:33,850
okay so and now I'm betting for the next

696
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:39,340
hand so what all did you notice that

697
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:41,619
happened there so I started out with

698
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,029
three red chips and with two hands it's

699
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,759
amazing that you can get away with that

700
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:48,009
pulled back the red chips and put down

701
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:51,009
two blacks covered by a red what is it

702
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:53,350
the value of a black chip hundred bucks

703
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:55,929
what's a red chip five bucks so that's

704
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:57,668
why it's called a 2:05 so I did that

705
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:59,679
what else did I do with my hands did

706
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:07,450
anybody see it's a little hard to see

707
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:08,409
from from a distance I tapped your hand

708
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,940
when you were going over there what

709
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:13,539
effect do you think that's gonna have on

710
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,100
a dealer in a real casino draws

711
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,809
attention the tapped hand how often do

712
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,830
you think players touch casino

713
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:22,539
dealer's bodies never that I may as well

714
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,449
just punched you in the nose yeah it's

715
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:28,720
rude as hell and that's just shocking so

716
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,399
what else happened with my hands when I

717
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,450
sat down did you see that I had a stack

718
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,969
of black chips here so what the cheater

719
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,679
does is they have they pretend to be

720
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,019
playing reds and greens which are five

721
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,210
and twenty five dollar chips but at the

722
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:46,240
same time I take the

723
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:48,880
chips the 2:05 I hide it in my hand and

724
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,550
I cover my black chips with it so he

725
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,620
thinks I'm just a red and green player

726
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:55,800
when I do the move I've switched in

727
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,750
these and I uncover the backup chips

728
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,270
when I tap his hand heels oh holy

729
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,640
this guy's a black chip player and so he

730
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,190
says to the kiss the pit boss black in

731
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,290
action black in action I'll do the hand

732
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,780
cup towards the microphone so you're hit

733
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,399
all at once with the black chips I take

734
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,690
away a chance for you to notice okay

735
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,890
this guy's bought in for a bunch of

736
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,280
hundred dollar chips but he's not

737
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:20,950
playing them yet so this happens all at

738
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,780
once very quickly what did you see when

739
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:28,120
I started saying you paid me wrong what

740
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:30,910
were my hands doing hands are face up

741
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,219
palm up so I look innocent right

742
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,080
I hit if I were wearing a jacket I would

743
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,360
hide the red chips in my pocket the ones

744
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,870
I took away and the last thing I did

745
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:48,879
before you paid me I kicked the chips

746
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:51,159
back at you why add pressure it's it's

747
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,710
aggressive it tries to give it back to

748
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,900
you but also when I do that if you call

749
00:29:53,710 --> 00:30:01,390
your boss over what is the boss gonna

750
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:06,130
see they see a bed of $205 that this guy

751
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:07,480
hasn't paid so they the boss the first

752
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,450
thing they're thinking is you got to pay

753
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,890
this guy also what were you doing when I

754
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,440
actually tapped your hand and went into

755
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,420
the claim you were paying this guy why

756
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,679
not wait until he's paying the fourth

757
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,679
player all the way over at first base

758
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,840
I'm sorry there's that I might have

759
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,600
already retracted my winnings that much

760
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,980
time elapsing between the wrong payout

761
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,209
and the claim makes it more look like it

762
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,610
increases the chance that the dealer is

763
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,070
gonna even consider the idea that I

764
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:45,340
passed posted that I added money to my

765
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,990
bet after it already won right so it's

766
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,669
got to be quick and it shows how good

767
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:51,220
you have to be as a mechanic to get away

768
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:54,370
with this move right so all those

769
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,780
individual little psychological tricks

770
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,030
that are used but

771
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,490
when you're doing this you don't have to

772
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,408
beat the eye in the sky the eye in the

773
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,539
sky hasn't been activated against you

774
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,669
yet yes they're always watching the the

775
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:09,120
cameras are always on but there's not

776
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:11,260
always a person looking at the screen

777
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,908
not every piece of data that gets

778
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,799
collected thank you very much you you're

779
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:21,250
fired by the way you paid off a cheater

780
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:24,299
so that's an example of the deep that is

781
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:27,270
an example of the tremendous amount of

782
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:30,668
psychological detail that goes into this

783
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:32,530
the next move we're going to talk about

784
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:34,090
is roulette past posting because we're a

785
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,860
little low on time I'm not gonna go

786
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,928
through the whole the rigmarole of doing

787
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,389
it but this is what a roulette layout

788
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:44,260
looks like right you've got the dealer

789
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:48,820
standing right here with chips the chip

790
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:52,330
well behind them into the right so this

791
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,590
particular move it slits this shows the

792
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,840
way that a good hacker

793
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:58,418
can find the weaknesses and procedure

794
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,760
and exploit them to their advantage all

795
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:02,950
right so there are several things that a

796
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,230
roulette dealer does when when bets go

797
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,270
down before the ball gets spun or rather

798
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,490
one one important thing they do and that

799
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:12,220
is that they cased the layout they look

800
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,570
at all the chips out there now if you're

801
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,190
playing roulette what kind of chips are

802
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,860
you betting are you betting normal

803
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,970
casino chips now you usually buy in for

804
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,889
roulette chips which are brightly

805
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,020
colored chips that you can only cash

806
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:25,150
back out at the roulette table but some

807
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:28,629
casinos at least used to let you buy in

808
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:31,270
with regular casino chips and so you

809
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:34,210
could potentially pass post a black chip

810
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,929
on the layout $100 chip and the way they

811
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,130
would do that

812
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:41,140
is they would use an important cover

813
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:43,000
which is that someone would bet a whole

814
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,610
bunch of stacks of dark colored chips

815
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,360
low down on a layout and then the

816
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:51,399
cheater would swap out this stack of

817
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,178
four blue chips for three blue chips in

818
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,150
a black so the black chip doesn't stand

819
00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:00,340
out the it is plausible that the dealer

820
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,809
missed the black chip because it just

821
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,730
blends in with all the other dark stuff

822
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:05,350
deep on the layout there's one other

823
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,580
very important detail and this is

824
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,879
another cover

825
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:11,830
done by one of the compete reott s--

826
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:14,620
they bet a big old stack of roulette

827
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:17,428
chips right here on this third dozen bet

828
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:20,110
what does that bet pay anybody no

829
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:23,889
two-to-one that bet pays two-to-one

830
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:26,320
somebody set it back there yeah so when

831
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:30,189
that bet comes in what does the dealer's

832
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,460
physically have to do they have to go

833
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:36,700
back to the well with both hands and

834
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,129
grab two stacks of chips that action of

835
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:42,580
grabbing multiple chips gives you just

836
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:45,009
enough time to do the move so those two

837
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,360
so first of all they exploit the fact

838
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:48,429
that you can use both the colored

839
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,340
roulette chips and normal black casino

840
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:53,679
chips at the same table they use that to

841
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,889
blend in and they get the time to do the

842
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,590
move by betting that stack of chips that

843
00:33:56,889 --> 00:34:03,549
has to be paid off with a two-handed

844
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,289
turn so by taking very specific actions

845
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:06,730
the exploited weaknesses in the houses

846
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:09,699
procedures now the last one we're gonna

847
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,310
talk about is called the Savannah the

848
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:14,078
Savannah is reverse past posting its

849
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,119
past posting backwards and it is the

850
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,540
most brilliant cheating move I've ever

851
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:22,800
heard of I think most people would agree

852
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:25,119
trick with the Savannah you just bet on

853
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,720
one of these column bets down here at

854
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,000
the end far away from the dealer a black

855
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,759
chip or any other high-value chip with a

856
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,239
couple red chips on top of it you stack

857
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,849
them up with the low value chips offset

858
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,819
maybe an eighth of an inch so that when

859
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:45,339
you're looking at it from a distance you

860
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:46,899
can't see that dark chip underneath you

861
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:49,119
don't get caught when the dealer's case

862
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,679
in the layout if the bet wins you

863
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,260
immediately go down hit the big one I

864
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:57,300
won $200 or what 5,000 or whatever it's

865
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,300
gonna be what do you do if it that loses

866
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,920
you just take the whole thing off the

867
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:08,290
whole thing what does the dealer do at

868
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:10,390
this point put that back down you took

869
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,610
that bet already lost oh I'm sorry

870
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,950
I'm sorry I just

871
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:21,550
I was going on what do you put back do

872
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:23,290
you put back it's not it's way it's so

873
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:26,530
it's it's beautiful you put down a bet

874
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:28,480
that looks like it's $20 for Reds you

875
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:33,460
sneak it away when it loses and you put

876
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,790
back for red chips for $20 so when you

877
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:41,650
make this bet you either win on a bed of

878
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:44,740
115 or you lose a bed of $20 what's what

879
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:46,390
else is brilliant about this what does

880
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:53,229
the house do when they realize you tried

881
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:56,529
to take away $20 but put it back if you

882
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,650
realize that somebody was finagling a 15

883
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,910
or $20 bet how big of a deal is that

884
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,150
it's not a big deal they don't call

885
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:06,430
surveillance when you do this move and

886
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,440
again you want to immediately celebrate

887
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,509
when the move wins because you want to

888
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,430
eliminate any possibility whatsoever

889
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:15,700
that they think that that bet was past

890
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:18,940
posted you separate the move from the

891
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,859
time when you get paid and the move is

892
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,840
sneaky enough so that when you do the

893
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,430
thing that's illegal you get underneath

894
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,050
the detection thresholds because it

895
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:31,390
doesn't look like enough money to be a

896
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:32,380
big deal so they did very well with this

897
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,690
move and we're gonna go through this

898
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,150
quickly cuz I talk way too damn much so

899
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:42,190
what is the casinos biggest advantage in

900
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:44,290
this fight the information you as a

901
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,870
defender have a massive information

902
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:51,730
advantage you all know that what is the

903
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:54,100
cheaters biggest advantage well there's

904
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:59,320
that that's part of it this is the other

905
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:02,920
piece of it lot of noise in a casino in

906
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,930
a busy casino you have drunk tourists

907
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,330
you have pensioners banging away at slot

908
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,589
machines you have people who think they

909
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,509
can beat the house but don't know what

910
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,940
they're doing John Stewart had a joke

911
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:15,130
towards the end the end of the Daily

912
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,860
Show's run under him about

913
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:20,350
Mountain a busy casino is basically

914
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,180
 ocean because there's so much

915
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,980
nonsense if I open a casino I think I'll

916
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,940
call it that ocean casino and

917
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,440
resort

918
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,819
this is what you're up against as a

919
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,490
surveillance artist I have a

920
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:33,579
surveillance worker stuff like lifting

921
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:35,950
off a $20 bet from the layout that's not

922
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:37,240
that weird that's just not that strange

923
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,589
people getting angry at the dealer

924
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,470
touching their hand that's not that

925
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:43,859
weird casinos have all this software BJ

926
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:46,299
survey blackjack analysis software

927
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:48,250
detects whole card players players who

928
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,710
are catching the whole card when the

929
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:52,869
dealer deals it too far vertically where

930
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:55,000
you can see the index on the card you

931
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:57,490
can figure out exactly how good they are

932
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,500
at triad counting cards biometrika big

933
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:01,810
company in this space facial recognition

934
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:06,670
software you can take a picture of a

935
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:08,078
player run it through a database old

936
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,359
piece of software called Nora

937
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,910
non-obvious relationship analysis

938
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:14,770
remember over here on the roulette pass

939
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:16,029
post the third section straight up it

940
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:18,040
took at least three people to do the

941
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,480
move you needed someone to bet the big

942
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,980
stack of white chips someone to bet all

943
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,400
the blue chips someone to claim the move

944
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:27,369
those are three different people Nora

945
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,630
non-obvious relationship awareness was a

946
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,609
piece of software that would identify

947
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,829
people and run them through a collection

948
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:35,410
of personal information a collection of

949
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:37,359
motion data and figure out if any of

950
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,910
them have worked together live together

951
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,009
might know each other think how strong

952
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,310
that software would be with social

953
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:47,619
networking now this was some guys

954
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,869
capstone project for a masters or PhD he

955
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:51,579
called it Rain Man 2.0 Rain man gets

956
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:55,329
card-counting pretty wrong in a lot of

957
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:56,950
ways but this is dynamic machine

958
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:58,690
learning software that will track the

959
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:01,779
indexes of the cards with the camera and

960
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,700
yes it's counting cards it realizes the

961
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,710
count to zero you have to face cards a

962
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,379
three and a five that's total count of

963
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,480
zero

964
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:15,640
why do blackjack counters still get away

965
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:18,099
with it we the can't be watching

966
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,868
everywhere yeah the detection of

967
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:22,030
response systems don't run themselves we

968
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:23,440
still do not live in a world where the

969
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,240
surveillance systems are smart enough

970
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,190
that the minute a bad guy walks in there

971
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,950
they're immediately detected the minute

972
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:32,230
an AP on blackjack table increases their

973
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,990
bet to match the count they get backed

974
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:37,510
off by a pit boss the casinos couldn't

975
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,560
do that they're risking too much money

976
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,960
by

977
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,430
off a legit good customer who's gonna

978
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,840
lose a lot of money to them in the long

979
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:50,770
run this stuff is hard you play until a

980
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,420
human catches you you can take the words

981
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:54,460
card-counting off and replace them with

982
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,370
hacking if you want it works but not

983
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,960
forever it is not about preventing it

984
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:01,450
it's about minimizing your time to the

985
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,180
detection in your time to response so

986
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,589
that's why APs have to do that trade-off

987
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,960
of how aggressive they're going to be

988
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,010
with their basic strategy variations and

989
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,810
how aggressive they're going to be with

990
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,060
their betting the exact same thing

991
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:15,220
happens with hackers I might be able to

992
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,360
stay in a network for six months if I'm

993
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,549
not doing anything

994
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,110
the minute I start rummaging around for

995
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,030
stuff I'm increasing the likelihood if

996
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:24,400
things are going to go wrong and think

997
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,290
about the Savannah they got away with

998
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,170
this so many times in so many different

999
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:31,630
casinos part of the reason why they were

1000
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:34,090
they got away with that is that they

1001
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,640
didn't have people going through their

1002
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:39,610
surveillance footage just on a general

1003
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,819
hunt for anything fishy if they hadn't

1004
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:44,650
been so tied to this this question of

1005
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,960
whether the black chip was there to

1006
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,610
begin with because the surveillance

1007
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,990
footage helps the cheater there the bet

1008
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,400
was always there when you did the

1009
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,910
Savannah that's why they got paid so

1010
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:58,240
many times they weren't just digging

1011
00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:00,129
through their footage looking for bad

1012
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,180
stuff going on what do we call that an

1013
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:06,100
info SEC threat hunting threat hunting

1014
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,600
is absolutely essential every - every

1015
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:11,860
alert threshold can be evaded so as a

1016
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,390
brief intro to how to approach threat

1017
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,370
hunting this is advice from this book

1018
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,319
it's a textbook about casino gaming

1019
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:20,799
surveillance they do what they call the

1020
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:24,010
IOU Patrol identify observe and

1021
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,600
understand identify look at each of your

1022
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,710
players see what you know about who they

1023
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,049
are and what they're doing

1024
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:32,110
observe collect information about their

1025
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,820
play understand means you analyze until

1026
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,890
you come to a conclusion is this just a

1027
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,690
gambler who might be getting lucky and

1028
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,520
that's why they're beating us is this a

1029
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:43,240
card counter is this a shuffle tracker

1030
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,800
is this players play so strange that we

1031
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,560
actually need to figure out if they've

1032
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,120
got a teammate this is a good starting

1033
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,328
point for how to approach threat hunting

1034
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,939
when you see activity on your network

1035
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:56,189
identify the pattern gather as much

1036
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:59,189
information as you can and then try to

1037
00:41:56,189 --> 00:42:00,989
understand it that may mean going to

1038
00:41:59,189 --> 00:42:03,109
threat databases that may mean

1039
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:05,429
correlating other logs that may mean

1040
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:06,989
checking virustotal that may mean

1041
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:08,689
looking at histories for the particular

1042
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:11,759
user in question looking at IP

1043
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:13,169
reputation information but this I would

1044
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:16,499
recommend is a starting point for how to

1045
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:18,719
do threat hunting also app sensor that

1046
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:20,669
is an OAuth project it is a standard for

1047
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,159
writing defensive tools for applications

1048
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:24,989
but I think the similar the same type of

1049
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,299
analysis can be used for network threat

1050
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:28,919
hunting this is the three questions in

1051
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:30,419
the app sensor paper that says how we

1052
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:33,569
determine whether behavior is just

1053
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:35,640
suspicious or actually an attack first

1054
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:38,069
of all who the event have happened

1055
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,019
through innocent user error is it

1056
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:43,519
possible that the user just accidentally

1057
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:48,029
typed dot dot slash in the location bar

1058
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:49,769
who knows maybe must the user leave the

1059
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:52,049
normal flow of the application to do the

1060
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:54,839
thing we observed is this something that

1061
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:56,309
would not happen through normal normal

1062
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,599
clicks are they deliberately going out

1063
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:58,889
of their way to find this and third our

1064
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,319
specialized software and knowledge

1065
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:02,609
needed to send a malformed HTTP request

1066
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:04,038
do you think most users are going to be

1067
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:06,630
able to do that with just their browser

1068
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:08,279
no that's super suspicious this is

1069
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:12,149
another very good starting point for

1070
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:14,009
what for how to determine whether

1071
00:43:12,149 --> 00:43:15,989
something is actually attacker behavior

1072
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:17,819
experience will help you identify weird

1073
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:19,349
activity the best example of this in the

1074
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:23,279
casino world I've read about is again

1075
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:25,289
from from this book a surveillance

1076
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:27,029
person doing an iou Patrol just looking

1077
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:29,669
through security cameras found a slot

1078
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:30,059
player with an ashtray sitting up on the

1079
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:32,999
machine

1080
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:37,759
covering the display of credits counting

1081
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:40,078
down any idea why that might have been

1082
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:43,259
give you a hint it was a machine that

1083
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,849
paid out in real coin they were using a

1084
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:46,859
device called the light wand one of the

1085
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:49,799
most infamous slot cheating devices ever

1086
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:51,630
it shines light directly into the coin

1087
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:54,329
reader the optical reader and the coin

1088
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:56,939
payout essentially blinds it when you

1089
00:43:54,329 --> 00:43:59,009
flash that light the coin counter

1090
00:43:56,939 --> 00:44:01,169
doesn't know its dispensing coins to you

1091
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:02,729
you turn that thing on and it will give

1092
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:04,890
you coins all day and all night

1093
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:07,830
the ashtray was up there because he knew

1094
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,500
was being watched and so he wanted to

1095
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:12,990
cover the credit out display so that

1096
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,540
anyone walking by or anyone watching him

1097
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:19,529
in surveillance wouldn't see that that

1098
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:20,820
counter stutter and slowdown because all

1099
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,600
the credits weren't the coins weren't

1100
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,800
being counted going out so that is

1101
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,900
having the experience to know what's

1102
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,880
weird and unusual is truly essential and

1103
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,680
that's what we one of the things we will

1104
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,200
learn over our careers before you can do

1105
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,000
any of this any of this threat hunting

1106
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,259
business any of this detection or

1107
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,500
analysis there's one thing you got to

1108
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,480
start with centralize your damn logs to

1109
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,660
quote Jake Williams his best advice yes

1110
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,120
yes Jake Williams smart guy I trust him

1111
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,950
you don't have to have a whole bunch of

1112
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,720
fancy stuff you don't have to spend 50

1113
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,310
gazillion dollars on Splunk or logarithm

1114
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,959
or oh whoops I'm probably not supposed

1115
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,400
to say that you don't have to spend

1116
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,520
ungodly amounts of money on expensive

1117
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,800
commercial products look at open source

1118
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,390
versions of tools like ELQ stack you

1119
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,030
could probably get a lot of this done

1120
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:08,160
just with some open source log

1121
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:12,180
collection and searching tools and a

1122
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,029
really good shell script on your team so

1123
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,919
one thing I will say collecting the logs

1124
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:20,340
is always the first step but the

1125
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,110
analysis step is more important so yes

1126
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,240
start with collecting the logs and worry

1127
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,950
about detection later but make sure you

1128
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,359
get to that detection analysis step

1129
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,830
don't just collect the logs and let them

1130
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,300
sit there that's the other side of the

1131
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,910
coin from this how many people have done

1132
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,530
that everybody all right we'll go very

1133
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,020
through quickly through the last 18

1134
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:39,090
slides every component of your operation

1135
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:43,100
is a target every casino game is a

1136
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:44,910
target every table game every machine

1137
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,190
how many ways are there to beat a

1138
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:49,379
blackjack game you know I have too long

1139
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,300
to brainstorm over this but you can

1140
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,680
manipulate the cards you can physically

1141
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,150
mark the cards if you're in a casino

1142
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,009
where you're allowed to touch the cards

1143
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,680
because they're dealt face down the

1144
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:01,740
dealer can steal from you you can mark

1145
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:04,470
the cards with invisible ink there are

1146
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:06,660
all kinds of ways to beat any given

1147
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,009
table game and so whenever you're

1148
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,420
deploying a new technology or

1149
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,460
considering deploying a technology or

1150
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,750
securing one that already exists I would

1151
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,640
start with these three questions what

1152
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,200
can I do what are the operations I have

1153
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,149
access to what can I learn what

1154
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,948
information leaks and what can I

1155
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:22,919
what other systems does this let me

1156
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:24,989
interact with anybody know what stride

1157
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:28,618
stands for this and that's exactly the

1158
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:31,499
process you go through on securing a

1159
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:33,749
table game the exact same thing one of

1160
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:34,799
the procedures that dealers do anybody

1161
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:39,448
know what a dealer does when they get

1162
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:43,049
tapped in or out they clear their hands

1163
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:45,449
sometimes it's holding them up sometimes

1164
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:47,549
they dust them off but that procedure is

1165
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:49,229
designed because the dealer is one of

1166
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:50,819
the thank you one of the most trusted

1167
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:53,729
people on the floor stride threat

1168
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:55,109
modeling who's heard of this it involves

1169
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:56,578
thinking of all the different attacks

1170
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:58,049
against the system and it involves a

1171
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:00,659
shock of all shocks a box an arrow

1172
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:02,669
diagram this is worth doing because it

1173
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:04,169
forces you to break down your system

1174
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:06,359
whether it's a network or application

1175
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:09,149
into its constituent components this

1176
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:10,859
example is a Windows sound API in the

1177
00:47:09,149 --> 00:47:12,749
operating system and yet they broke it

1178
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:14,159
down into individual components every

1179
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:16,229
piece of a system can attack other

1180
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,699
pieces of a system and this process

1181
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:20,968
forces you to think through your

1182
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:23,039
defenses so you design procedures based

1183
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:25,319
on your threat model and you detect

1184
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,459
attackers at the margins it's not the

1185
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:30,329
exploit it's the other stuff they do

1186
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:33,569
understanding the adversary conveys a

1187
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:36,749
massive advantage Dan Kaminsky put it

1188
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:38,399
this way you get to cheat casinos get to

1189
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:39,928
change the rules on you they can flat

1190
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:41,159
bet you they can tell you you can't

1191
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:43,379
change your bets they're allowed to do

1192
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:46,439
that in Missouri you get to put honey

1193
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:47,999
pots on your network you can set traps

1194
00:47:46,439 --> 00:47:51,089
for the attacker when you understand how

1195
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:52,919
they think here are a few examples one

1196
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:55,649
of the best iwell I will share with you

1197
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:57,479
then tens power shell defense repo it

1198
00:47:55,649 --> 00:47:59,549
injects fake credentials in the network

1199
00:47:57,479 --> 00:48:01,739
so someone runs mini cats and tries to

1200
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:07,439
log in somewhere your sim alerts on that

1201
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:09,659
oh this the last couple examples are

1202
00:48:07,439 --> 00:48:11,699
about weaponizing the ir process and

1203
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:14,039
phishing great stories one of them is

1204
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:15,749
you send an email you know is gonna get

1205
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,089
caught this is Kru due to rob fuller and

1206
00:48:15,749 --> 00:48:20,249
chris gates then when you watch how they

1207
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:22,919
analyze all the infrastructure you set

1208
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:23,339
up you know their IR PlayBook the last

1209
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:25,019
one

1210
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:26,879
sometimes people forwarding an email

1211
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:29,249
around internally makes it trust it and

1212
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:31,069
suddenly the content you put in the

1213
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:32,718
email gets loaded thing

1214
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:34,849
creatively we are never going to have it

1215
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,529
all figured out social engineering tip

1216
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:38,390
always get out and stay out in front

1217
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:40,219
there is an instance where a past post

1218
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:42,410
went horribly wrong in the book American

1219
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:44,539
roulette the member of their team who

1220
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:46,249
was in charge of security spilled a club

1221
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:47,930
soda all over the roulette layout and

1222
00:48:46,249 --> 00:48:50,868
started apologizing profusely

1223
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:53,959
he made the staff react to him he took

1224
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:54,920
control of the situation always stay out

1225
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,959
in front if you're doing social

1226
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,430
engineering practitioners tip never

1227
00:48:56,959 --> 00:49:00,078
underestimate the value of a good

1228
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:02,239
cheekbone another one of the best

1229
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,539
stories from American roulette instead

1230
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,859
of past posting 205 once one of the

1231
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:09,199
members of the team who was retiring

1232
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:12,739
passed posted a rainbow a yellow a

1233
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:14,479
purple a black a green and a red he

1234
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:17,209
switched out five red chips for five

1235
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:19,129
different colors he got paid because the

1236
00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:21,140
psychology was all that matters I'm

1237
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,910
being told STFU focus on the

1238
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,680
fundamentals that is the last career tip

1239
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,759
I have understand the technology

1240
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,098
understand the attacks and defenses

1241
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,539
that's all I got I will post a slide so

1242
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:33,099
you can actually read them info SEC

1243
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:33,099
content on this so thank you very much
