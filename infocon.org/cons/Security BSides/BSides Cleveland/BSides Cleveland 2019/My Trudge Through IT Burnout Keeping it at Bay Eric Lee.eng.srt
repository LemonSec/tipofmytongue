1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
one our next talk is by Eric Lee he's

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,790
traveled away from Kansas City to be

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,960
with us today he's gonna be talking

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,190
about IT burnout

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:18,300
so here's Eric thank you

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,619
okay so Oh pictures crazy this is gonna

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,980
be a different talk than you've probably

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,198
seen in most conferences this is not

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:31,560
gonna be a technical talk in any way

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:33,300
shape or form so just be aware that it's

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,449
non-technical number one and number two

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,129
this is going to be my story about me

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,040
you may be able to take things from it

14
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,809
but that'll vary depending on who you

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,309
are and where you're at in life okay

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,500
so about me again my name is Eric Lee

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,930
I've been an IT for a little over 25

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,809
years my friends always call me the

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,390
weird person in IT because I'm not into

20
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,399
sci-fi Lord of the Rings any of that

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,050
stuff like that so when they start

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,729
talking about Star Trek I just kind of

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,590
like tone-deaf and in glazed-over look I

24
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,439
do a lot of got a lot of dirt track

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,920
races and build things and and do other

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,059
things like that so that's what I'm into

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,820
all right what we're here for

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,259
IT burnout how many people have heard

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,179
about IT burnout much over the last

30
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:27,930
couple years yeah there you go

31
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:30,270
so I've written this presentation a

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,360
couple years ago I submitted it to about

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,970
six conferences I got turned down for

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,119
all of them and I was like this sucks

35
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,310
so I said after about four or five beers

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,860
one night I said screw it I banged out a

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,210
blog post on it send it over to a friend

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,530
and I was like what do you think about

39
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,289
this and they were like this needs to be

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,350
in the community so I hit submit with my

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,740
finger shaking two posts and closed my

42
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,449
laptop went to bed next day I had a ton

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,130
of responses and everybody saying we

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,990
should be talking about this stuff and

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,399
I'm like well that's funny because none

46
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:07,289
of the conference's want me to so I

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,520
don't know what to do so I went through

48
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,950
right I would through burnout a couple

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,100
times but I never really thought about

50
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:16,290
it when it happened because burn

51
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,090
was never talked about in the community

52
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,120
for about the first 15 years that I was

53
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,290
in IT I'd heard about it twice couple

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,240
people in the community committed

55
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,100
suicide we talked about it for two or

56
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,650
three weeks and then it just disappeared

57
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,900
right like a lot of other topics that we

58
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,210
deal with so when I was going through

59
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,080
burnout I had no idea at first that's

60
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,390
what it was

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,850
right it was not around we didn't talk

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,010
about it so I had no idea but after

63
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,660
going through it twice I think about it

64
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,220
every day right it's something I have to

65
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,579
stay on top of so I don't go through it

66
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,020
again I would like to say I was normally

67
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,210
say right now we don't talk about it

68
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,250
enough in the community but we're

69
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,540
getting better at it I if you haven't

70
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,780
noticed the mental health village over

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,900
here has phenomenal information about

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,670
burnout and mental health over there too

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,130
so please stop by look at their

74
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,769
literature talk to somebody if you need

75
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,310
to even though we're doing this we still

76
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,530
need to do a better job mental health

77
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,970
soft skills stuff like this is no

78
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,710
different than the technical skills that

79
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,420
we're learning at this conference we

80
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,620
need to be helping out each other make

81
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,929
sure everybody is aware of what's going

82
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,560
on look out for each other

83
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:30,900
and help them through it so this is my

84
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:33,270
journey through IT burnout starting when

85
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,520
I was little so a little background

86
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,850
information I grew up in a busy family

87
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,250
had two brothers a ton of cousins know

88
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,079
most all boys my parents got married

89
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,920
were in there 18 had an older brother in

90
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,330
there 19 myself when they're 21 I spent

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,119
most of my time hanging around family

92
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,250
and friends riding bikes skateboarding

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,180
you know playing kick-the-can anybody

94
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,930
kick the can

95
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,810
yeah miss that game and BB gun wars lots

96
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,770

98
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,890

99
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,520
else you get your your your butt beat

100
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,440
right my parents were working all the

101
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,970
time so we just we were just kind of

102
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,680
running around doing whatever we could

103
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:22,229
kill time as I got older my things

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,300
changed that I did best friend I helped

105
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:27,240
build that race car and the top left

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,250
your left from the ground up we borrow

107
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,530
his dad's flatbed truck went and bought

108
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,110
it at the junkyard and we did everything

109
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,818
but put the roll cage in it you know I

110
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,710
played baseball I played golf I played

111
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,039
on a competitive traveling soccer team

112
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,530
we went all over the Midwest my parents

113
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,000
as I said worked a bunch of hours they

114
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,739
tried to make it to our events what they

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,400
could but they couldn't make it to all

116
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,250
of them we weren't poor by any means but

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,349
we didn't have a lot of money either I

118
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,680
vividly remember going the grocery

119
00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:01,169
stores a couple times with my mom you

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,030
know my brothers in tow and we couldn't

121
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:07,380
check out because her check wouldn't

122
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:09,239
clear so we we got by but we didn't have

123
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,810
the money to always go to the doctor and

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,190
go do all these other things after high

125
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,280
school I moved to Kansas City to play

126
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,830
college soccer I'm completely on my own

127
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,929
now you know physically mentally and

128
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,520
financially my dad gave me 20 bucks for

129
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,520
gas and said good luck son

130
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:32,370
two years playing soccer my parents saw

131
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,289
one of my college soccer games but not

132
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,699
only I go to school full time in order

133
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,690
to pay for this I had to work full time

134
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:42,719
one year I even had eleven w-2s

135
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,849
that's how busy I was on top of playing

136
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:48,949
soccer I also held executive positions

137
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:51,870
in the fraternity I was in I was busy

138
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:54,479
all the time sometimes I don't remember

139
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,960
when I slept but I was busy had to do

140
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,000
what I had to do to survive and get done

141
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,030
in the jobs I was working most of them

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,030
were in the IT field so to me just being

143
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:10,979
busy isn't IT burnout after college I

144
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,419
spent four years doing a back-end

145
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,400
systems integration for the company I

146
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,400
worked at our company was bought out by

147
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,469
another one in Finland so I was in

148
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,508
charge of all the Americas so I did

149
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:23,130
across five companies back in systems

150
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,900
integration for Active Directory and

151
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,580
some other things and then after those

152
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,060
first two years I actually got to do it

153
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,169
globally so someone for the Midwest who

154
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,469
vacation was going to your grandparents

155
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,990
house in the next town over going to

156
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:39,750
Finland going to Sweden go into

157
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,770
Australia Sal Paulo all these other

158
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,389
places was awesome

159
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:47,878
I traveled over 80% of the time those

160
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,909
four years some weeks when we were doing

161
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,840
cut overs I worked 90 hours that we even

162
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:56,490
more okay lots of long hours I felt the

163
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,489
stress of getting the job done that week

164
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,560
but nothing that didn't go away you know

165
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,229
once we were done with that we got that

166
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,000
site done you could breathe you'd come

167
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:08,849
back you'd have a few days to get caught

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,970
up before you would go to the next one

169
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:15,330
or what have you he was a lot of work

170
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,250
and there was some stress but I still

171
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,139
enjoyed other activities that I did with

172
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,250
my other friends when I actually had

173
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:26,930
time so to me just working long hours by

174
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,930
itself isn't IT burnout

175
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,010
the only thing that is constant is

176
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,719
change this has been around for quite a

177
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,300
while and this is kind of where things

178
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,000
started taking a shift during the last

179
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,830
year of that long project I was on and

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,130
then the following two years there was a

181
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:48,820
hugely noticeable change in the company

182
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,200
I worked at specifically in our team

183
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,340
none of our internal customers were

184
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,320
happy with us anymore

185
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,549
none of our projects were getting fully

186
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,870
funded we were losing good teammates

187
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,500
that were leaving to go somewhere else

188
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:06,620
and in general our overall morale was

189
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,350
just down people weren't happy I wasn't

190
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,090
happy because because projects weren't

191
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,310
getting funded in the manufacturing

192
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,929
company I worked at the manufacturing

193
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,360
side of the company were hiring their

194
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,820
own IT staff to make up for it

195
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,740
and on top of that they put in their own

196
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,560
switches their own servers and

197
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,820
everything else right next stars it was

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,580
ridiculous by this time I'd worked there

199
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,020
11 years and my boss at the time had

200
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,419
been my boss for about six years he just

201
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,069
really didn't care he hid like well

202
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,459
that's great less work we have to do

203
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,930
this is awesome right I implemented a

204
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,420
ton of the improvements over the years

205
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,609
that were there I really felt like I was

206
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,079
a part of the company but I was pissed

207
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,720
off at my boss I really hated him okay I

208
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,530
wanted to do even more for the company

209
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,900
but my boss was an idiot but to me not

210
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,089
liking my boss or that job or that

211
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,090
company by itself is not IT burnout I

212
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,530
didn't know how much like stress and

213
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,840
everything else that was going on with

214
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:15,410
this and my boss and some of the other

215
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,600
things during this time until I was

216
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,270
watching TV with my wife one day and I

217
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,830
can still remember this vividly it was

218
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,319
in the basement downstairs to the left

219
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,290
sitting on the couch watching TV I can't

220
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,780
tell you what's on the TV because I had

221
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,250
no idea I was so engulfed in what I was

222
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,930
doing like thinking about work and

223
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,630
everything else I don't remember it was

224
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,609
on the TV but my wife I can still

225
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,490
picture it she asked me what are you

226
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,860
thinking about and I'm like why she said

227
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,980
look at your hand and my left hand

228
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,840
just shaking like tremors like I've had

229
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:54,160
Parkinson's for 15 years or something

230
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:59,360
like that I was like oh crap there it is

231
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,610
something's going on right we started

232
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,730
talking about how I felt you know what I

233
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,290
was thinking about you know how I

234
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,730
physically felt stuff like that and it

235
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,650
became obvious that I couldn't even

236
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,320
watch TV without fixating on what was

237
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,360
going on at work as we talked over the

238
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,440
next few days there was other symptoms

239
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,320
that came about I speak sarcasm as a

240
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,530
primary language anybody else yep there

241
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,530
you go

242
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:30,380
sarcasm usually like you're right on

243
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,680
that line of being snarky right that can

244
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,260
go bad versus the sarcasm well I didn't

245
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,780
tiptoe that line I like jumped in with

246
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,490
both feet when I was in that well and I

247
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,280
didn't realize it until my wife brought

248
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,010
it up I was extremely snarky to the

249
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,230
point where I was just being mean about

250
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,120
stuff that didn't matter at all like

251
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,170
leaving a jacket out or something like

252
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,390
that

253
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,310
I was never physically being or or

254
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,040
anything like that to her but just these

255
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,800
snide little comments all the time other

256
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,020
things I hated going to the movies

257
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,910
anymore I hated paying money to go to a

258
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,410
movie that when it was over I could

259
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,040
remember anything that actually happened

260
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,280
because I'm thinking about work right

261
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,550
the other thing is I would play freecell

262
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,319
like for hours and have no idea how many

263
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,780
games I won or lost you're just clicking

264
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,180
right have you ever seen that men like

265
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,819
Oh was at Homer he found the end of the

266
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,349
Internet I would just be like searching

267
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,970
through the internet at times and have

268
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,200
no idea what I was looking for what I

269
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,940
looked at so in essence I was wrapped up

270
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,290
so much into my work that I wasn't

271
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,470
looking out for my own mental and

272
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,410
physical health

273
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:44,300
my wife had seen a lot of these signs

274
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,930
but we never really talked about him and

275
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,910
part of that is is back to how I was

276
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,319
brought up as a free-range kid with

277
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:56,329
mostly boys doing mostly stupid stuff we

278
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,120
never talked about our feelings ever

279
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,890
my wife on the other hand is from almost

280
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,720
all females and they still to this day

281
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,689
talk at least once a day about what's

282
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,930
going on about everything in life so

283
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,490
it's really hard to get somebody who

284
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,630
wants to talk about everything and

285
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,580
somebody who wants to talk about

286
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,360
absolutely nothing to actually talk

287
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:19,130
about feelings together it's kind of

288
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,630
like getting people that like vm's to

289
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:25,550
talk to people who likes kubernetes

290
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:28,070
right it's the same thing so I didn't

291
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,510
know what else did you I know I didn't

292
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,950
want to be at the company anymore but I

293
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,510
also didn't want to leave because I'd

294
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,000
been there for so long and done all that

295
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:38,060
but I was burned out on the job the

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,350
situation the tech that was there the

297
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,479
amount hours I was putting in all of it

298
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,350
so what did I do

299
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,450
well not much actually or could be a lot

300
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,970
depending on who you are and how you

301
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:56,840
feel about things I just changed jobs

302
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,340
that fixes everything right after

303
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,800
spending some time reflecting I was like

304
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,630
you know I just gotta go luckily didn't

305
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,430
take long for me to find a new job and

306
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,580
within two weeks of starting my new job

307
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:10,160
the shaking went completely away when I

308
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,930
was at home my wife is like hey there

309
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:18,189
you are again I know this person right

310
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,189
but what did I actually change

311
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:28,949
nothing nothing at all

312
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:32,220
well actually you know not nothing but

313
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,140
very very close right so start a new job

314
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,420
was there about three and a half years

315
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,580
had a lot of the same things I had at my

316
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,430
previous job we merged with another

317
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:45,839
company more integrations long hours I

318
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:48,029
had to get rid of Lotus Notes puke very

319
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,670
stressful projects the company I worked

320
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:55,740
at was in marketing advertising area it

321
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:58,110
was 2008 recession budget cuts again you

322
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,610
know but through all of this I didn't

323
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,440
have any of the shaking I didn't have

324
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,860
the excessive snarkiness I didn't have

325
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:09,120
any of that stuff so I had absolutely no

326
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,830
symptoms of IT burnout and then one day

327
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,300
I'm out shoveling the driveway and the

328
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,470
guy cross streets like hey I'm looking

329
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,540
for somebody that knows all this stuff

330
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,339
I'm like okay cool like I'm interested

331
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,319
it's like yeah we're trying to do a CI

332
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,210
CD journey I need to automate all this

333
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,380
stuff we don't know how to do it I'm

334
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,260
like sweetie that's right up my alley

335
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:29,610
let's go do it so I took this other job

336
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,770
and it was awesome

337
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,839
free rein to do whatever we wanted to

338
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,550
take a manual process of building and

339
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,100
testing code and completely automated it

340
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,790
so they would do five builds a week and

341
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,700
test it for a full stack and report on

342
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,980
it within about four or five months we

343
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,650
got it down to automated no touch

344
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,959
testing every 12 hours of about a

345
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,990
hundred and fifty tests and from that

346
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,279
point on it just grew and grew and grew

347
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,910
the it was the best job I ever had

348
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,980
because I 50 percent of my job was to go

349
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,709
to conferences look at software look at

350
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,800
processes do whatever we can to make

351
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:11,010
this process better and faster the VP of

352
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,599
our company was full-on like he he

353
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,939
understood that this was gonna make our

354
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,190
software better you know customers

355
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,000
happier everything like that it was

356
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:22,140
awesome the most challenging part of the

357
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,089
job was every year we had a client

358
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,920
conference and I was in charge of the

359
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,750
lab infrastructure for them to run stuff

360
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,819
on I didn't have to do the content of

361
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,449
the labs but I had to have the lab front

362
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,739
end and the back end stuff as well too

363
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,939
and it usually took about three to four

364
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:39,509
months to get that all set up and

365
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:41,219
working one year we're having problems

366
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:44,129
with the cloud vendor getting their

367
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,919
stuff working right and it was Thursday

368
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:48,600
and the conference starts on Monday

369
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:53,189
and we're doing the conference in

370
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,449
Orlando and my coworker he looked over

371
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:57,868
at me and he was like hey dude er you're

372
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:58,618
all right I'm like why and he goes look

373
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:02,399
at your hand

374
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:04,049
and I started shaking again so I looked

375
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,059
down at it and it was probably about a

376
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:08,059
fifth as bad as it was previously before

377
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:15,119
luckily I kinda remembered most of the

378
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:16,319
symptoms I've had the last time so took

379
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:19,139
a step back looked at all the other

380
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:20,969
symptoms I wasn't being snarky I enjoyed

381
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,709
hanging out with friends I enjoyed going

382
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,839
the movies Jay enjoyed a lot of that

383
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:27,988
stuff so I didn't think I was in burnout

384
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,819
this time after we arrived in Orlando a

385
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:31,709
few days later I called the vendor we

386
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:37,559
ran another test everything worked

387
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:40,138
successfully right 30 minutes later look

388
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:44,189
down my hands not shaking anymore so I

389
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:47,249
just wrapped that up to stress should

390
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:48,719
have probably gone to a doctor yeah but

391
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:51,419
let's go back and think about you know

392
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,480
where I came from we didn't talk about

393
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:56,160
her feelings we didn't go to the doctor

394
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,809
we didn't talk to doctors about her

395
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,339
feelings yeah you know people like this

396
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:03,868
right yeah same kind of deal so even

397
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,110
though I had some physical stuff I

398
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:09,029
related it to mental stuff and in our

399
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:12,000
realm you don't go to the doctors for

400
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:13,980
mental stuff or physical stuff unless it

401
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:24,630
can't be cured with duct tape in paper

402
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:26,970
towels superglue all right so so during

403
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,809
this time I was been recruited by a

404
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,250
reseller that I'd known for a while I

405
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,210
never really wanted to go over there

406
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,230
because I didn't like some of the

407
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,880
management at this time there was about

408
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,110
five people that I'd worked with at a

409
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,330
previous company that were there and

410
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,580
they're like it's different come on over

411
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,070
it's great you know we've changed

412
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,629
so I was trying to decide if I should

413
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,210
stay at the best job I ever had or

414
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,380
should I go to this other place pros and

415
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,770
cons I could go help some other

416
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,300
companies you know would be great I can

417
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,490
learn new things about how other places

418
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,760
do it it was I thought it would be

419
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,860
awesome so um and it worked last time

420
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,120
right to change jobs like let's just do

421
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:12,310
this again so I changed jobs and the

422
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,100
first nine months it was awesome met a

423
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:18,490
lot of people loved my customers most of

424
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,780
them it was awesome

425
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,880
and then all of a sudden after nine

426
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,879
months some practices came back or

427
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,200
showed up that I didn't like some weird

428
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,610
things that I didn't think were I don't

429
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,710
know how to put it like I just didn't

430
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,780
agree with them like sharing data that

431
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,060
shouldn't be shared to the sales staff

432
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,720
or what have you and then I got blasted

433
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,550
by the the the CEO of the company to the

434
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,010
whole entire sales team for two things

435
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:47,110
that I had nothing to do with and when

436
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,750
it was finally shown to him that I had

437
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,149
nothing to do with it he just kind of

438
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,010
blew me off like oh no big deal you know

439
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,260
he's just a peon it shouldn't matter and

440
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,530
there was no retractions than now

441
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,180
it was awful like the the crappy part of

442
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,690
the company he'd come back and and I

443
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,760
just you know had to go but before they

444
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,500
could even get out of there I lost half

445
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,530
my account managers as they hired

446
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,120
somebody else in another area that part

447
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:17,139
of the company or that those account

448
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:21,909
managers accounted for roughly 60% of my

449
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,800
quota if anybody in sales in sales if

450
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,980
you don't know your salary is really

451
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,649
small and most your money comes from

452
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,560
your bonuses from getting your quota so

453
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:36,910
now I've lost the potential to even make

454
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:40,210
quota because they didn't really Jeff

455
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,740
tur losing them so there is no way I

456
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,190
could even remotely provide for my

457
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:51,160
family

458
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:54,160
like I would able to before yeah on top

459
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,310
of all this I left the best job I ever

460
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,350
had in my life and now I have a wife and

461
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,120
two kids so

462
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:04,360
not only am I not being able to provide

463
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,969
for myself but my wife and two kids the

464
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,549
way it was before every time I needed

465
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,320
work on TAS you know before I left I

466
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:13,570
would catch myself repeatedly thinking

467
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,610
about that last job I had and I just

468
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,789
couldn't let it go I faded into some

469
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:22,178
depression previous symptoms all came

470
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:25,510
back the good news this time as I was

471
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:27,789
able to recognize the symptoms I took a

472
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,980
different job with another company in an

473
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:32,140
area where I wasn't excited to be but I

474
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,159
had to get out of where I was at just to

475
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,960
get away from there's terrible people

476
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,400
the problem is is that a couple of my

477
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,470
good friends when I talk to them about

478
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,400
taking this job they told me not to do

479
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,780
it don't go there so one of the things I

480
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,240
had sitting in the back of my head this

481
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,030
whole time is the I told you so

482
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,480
right that's one of the worst things

483
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,760
ever and I didn't want to hear it

484
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,679
because of that I closed off myself I

485
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,140
didn't go to social activities with them

486
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,830
I stayed out of the community I did a

487
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,679
lot of things I quit doing a lot of

488
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:11,799
things I used to do before

489
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,039
so changing this changing jobs again

490
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:17,500
didn't make me happy and honestly like I

491
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,039
alluded to earlier earlier it never did

492
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,270
now I was still depressed every day I

493
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,100
would see somebody from the old

494
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,190
organization where I was at before cuz

495
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,020
we were in the same area of town and it

496
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,770
would just remind me that I left the

497
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:37,210
best job I ever had for the worst job I

498
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:40,049
ever had my window where I said looked

499
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:43,960
right at the old building where I was at

500
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:47,908
so it was damn near impossible to get

501
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,740
anything done I was in burnout again

502
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:54,940
false depression full everything else

503
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,549
and I couldn't get myself out so let's

504
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,750
talk about a couple things real quick

505
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:01,570
I've stated some things that you've

506
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,400
heard in the past that working long

507
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,620
hours is burped out just don't work long

508
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,049
hours and you won't be burnt out okay

509
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,510
that's not it

510
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:12,310
so that and some of the others what does

511
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,250
IT burnout to me

512
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,510
to me it's any combination of these

513
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,420
areas that are being far enough

514
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:22,060
quote-unquote out of whack that leaves

515
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,980
you exhausted day after day to the point

516
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:29,800
that you stop doing the things that you

517
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:31,660
normally do so make sense so for some

518
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,810
people it might be one or two of these

519
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,030
for other people it's all of these it's

520
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:42,040
gonna be different for everybody but for

521
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:44,020
me it was pretty much all of them and

522
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,680
what's different about burnout and IT

523
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,660
versus just depression right cuz some

524
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,220
people have asked me hey Eric

525
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,100
your just depression why is this IT

526
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,260
burnout well I think IT can be different

527
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,419
in some areas right we're always

528
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,720
connected and have been before the rest

529
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,040
of the world was really always connected

530
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,470
we're always trying to keep up with new

531
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,909
technologies new methods new stuff like

532
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,880
that there's always more and more and

533
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:13,090
more a lot of times now we don't even

534
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,640
get breaks between projects right when I

535
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,230
was an IT years ago like you'd have a

536
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,730
project and then when you're done you

537
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,500
would at least have a couple weeks or if

538
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,360
not for two like before you started

539
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,430
working on next big project you'd have

540
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,810
some smaller stuff but now it seems like

541
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,280
you're not even halfway done with wine

542
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,510
and you're starting the next one and

543
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,530
then the first one never gets done

544
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,180
because you don't have enough time to

545
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,820
finish it and you're just in this

546
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,010
constant cycle of chasing your tail

547
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,530
right

548
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,530
sometimes it's the repetitive work you

549
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,180
know the monotonous clicking the same

550
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,800
thing over and over and over again right

551
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,480
having no real buy into what you're

552
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:51,550
doing the concept firefighting in some

553
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,140
places right you never can get ahead

554
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,240
because you like I said earlier constant

555
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,100
firefighting and then sometimes it's

556
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,240
just supporting those crappy old legacy

557
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:03,219
systems can just they just suck right

558
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,280
all right one more thing to talk about

559
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,830
right now let's talk about the suicide

560
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,899
because I'm guessing at least one person

561
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,820
here is thinking you know he hasn't said

562
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,110
anything about suicide you know he

563
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,010
there's no way he went through IT

564
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:20,459
burnout well let's talk about that not

565
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:23,770
everyone who has burnout or depression

566
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,690
automatically goes to suicide I'll be

567
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,090
candidly honest I

568
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,700
thought about suicide I thought about it

569
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,800
multiple times the number of hours I

570
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,760
thought about it could fill up a couple

571
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,129
months set my car in parking lots

572
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,560
thinking about it staring up at the sky

573
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,390
you know not going home to my wife and

574
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:47,639
kids thinking about it be better off for

575
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:50,230
me to not be here the reality is for me

576
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,580
the way I thought about it is sometimes

577
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,130
when we think about taking one of those

578
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,110
exotic trips to some island that you can

579
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,680
only see by zooming all the way into it

580
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,929
right on on Google Earth I thought about

581
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,210
it a lot about not being around but I

582
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,650
never thought about exactly how I would

583
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,940
do it and where I would do it or

584
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,890
anything like that I never thought about

585
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,610
what airplane I would have to take to

586
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,590
get there

587
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:19,060
what boat I'd have to then take or any

588
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:21,040
of that other stuff so not specifically

589
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,129
thinking about all that I mean doesn't

590
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,330
mean that you have not been in Burnout

591
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:29,260
or in severe enough depression of state

592
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:33,970
depressive state that you need to look

593
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:37,330
at help all right time to move forward

594
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:42,130
right why am I here now talking about

595
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:44,260
this how did I get there so I have some

596
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,810
friends that I meet with regularly and

597
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:50,140
they noticed I was in a bad state and

598
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,940
they would try to talk to me in all this

599
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,280
stuff right but as I said before we

600
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,650
never talked about our feelings yeah

601
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,940
heck by this time in my life my dad has

602
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:01,240
only told me he was proud of me twice

603
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:05,980
ever you know and this is only six years

604
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:08,290
ago so and I'm not young that's kind of

605
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,840
how I was brought up so we never talked

606
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:14,560
about feelings but talking to my friends

607
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:18,189
my peers felt easier because I felt that

608
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,720
you guys work in an IT can relate versus

609
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,780
talking to my wife who doesn't work in I

610
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,420
see she would have no idea right so it

611
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:28,570
was getting easier to talk to them but

612
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:31,540
talking didn't automatically you know

613
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,389
make me stop obsessing about leaving the

614
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,760
best job I ever had

615
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:38,710
right how like I just couldn't stop

616
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,450
obsessing about it so one day I'm out

617
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,950
with a friend who

618
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,029
doesn't work in IT and we're at the bar

619
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,919
just sitting there having a couple

620
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:45,779
drinks up to work and I'm staring

621
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,610
directly through the TV again and he's

622
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:50,190
chirping on about something I probably

623
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,990
golf or something stupid and finally he

624
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,330
was like hey dude like what's going on

625
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,590
I'm like wait what and he's like what

626
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,360
are you thinking about like what's going

627
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,850
on you're you're you're not being a good

628
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,199
friend here like what's happening so

629
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:05,039
after a while I finally gave in I told

630
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,929
him told him how I ruined my life by

631
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,000
leaving the best job I ever had for the

632
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:10,769
worst job I ever had and now I can't get

633
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,750
the best job ever head back and I'm

634
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:16,340
never gonna find another one and I'm a

635
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:22,639
loser and I'm dumb yada yada yada yada

636
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:22,639
and you know what this is what he said

637
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:28,769
sometimes you need to that friend to

638
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:31,169
just give you that little kick in the

639
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:34,049
rear end you know what I mean

640
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:35,580
like sometimes the touchy-feely stuff is

641
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:38,820
great for certain areas and sometimes

642
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:43,830
you need somebody to just kick you where

643
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:45,210
you need to be kicked so how did I get

644
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:49,408
out of this

645
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:53,340
I needed a strategy I started with one

646
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:56,010
and I worked my way up to six but I I

647
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,418
needed to figure out ways to combat this

648
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,830
to where it didn't happen again no

649
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,990
matter where I worked and what kind of

650
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:04,260
environment I worked in so let's go

651
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,940
through these six support system first

652
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,379
off I had to get rid of the idiots I

653
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,059
hung around with that all they did was

654
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,799
complain all the time about how bad

655
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:15,000
their life is in every single way shape

656
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,649
or form now I was doing that myself so

657
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,960
this was hard because I had to look at

658
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:20,459
some of them and decide you're just an

659
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,260
idiot and I don't need to be around you

660
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,799
anymore because you're negative all the

661
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,870
time

662
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,340
and you're going through the or the

663
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,018
other hand is you're going through the

664
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,110
same stuff I'm going through we need to

665
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:33,029
help each other out and move forward and

666
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,620
that one was really hard um

667
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:36,659
these people I had to make sure that

668
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,830
they had my back as much as I'm willing

669
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,539
to have their back and if they're not

670
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,340
willing to be there for me when I really

671
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,440
need them then I probably don't need

672
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,850
that in my life

673
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,029
the other thing I had to do with this is

674
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:53,219
talk to my boss and this is extremely

675
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:55,980
extremely extremely difficult luckily

676
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,289
I had a pretty good boss at the time my

677
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,780
late my current boss well he just left

678
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:03,090
yesterday so it sucks but he's awesome

679
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,539
both of those we talked about what

680
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:08,520
triggers my depression you know I like

681
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,100
to fix everything on my own and

682
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,260
sometimes I'll get stuck fixating on the

683
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,539
problem for days and days and days and

684
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,240
days and days and days and days anybody

685
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:20,220
else yeah yeah and then you got to get

686
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,530
that tunnel vision and then you find

687
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,570
yourself slipping into that like spot

688
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,490
and my boss I'm like listen if you see

689
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,928
me doing that like just kick me like

690
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,880
let's figure out how to get this solved

691
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:32,010
or something like that the other thing

692
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,490
is is I had to talk to him about how I

693
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,890
liked criticism right and in how I like

694
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,049
to be rewarded everybody likes to have

695
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:42,809
rewarded the recognition in different

696
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:46,710
ways so I really had to talk about how I

697
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:49,110
liked that versus the other the next

698
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,120
thing I had to do was get organized I've

699
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:54,000
been complaining to my wife for a while

700
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,059
about shared calendars she's a teacher

701
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,679
she likes her paper calendar and I'm

702
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,178
like this does not work I don't know

703
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,860
when the kids activities are I don't

704
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:03,539
know what's going on so I got her on

705
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,678
board and now she loves it the other

706
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:09,720
thing I do is inbox zero it's called as

707
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,150
an archaic I can't pronounce it effect

708
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,159
I've got a link to a great blog post

709
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,600
about it later and it's about how you're

710
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,760
constantly thinking about things that

711
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,230
you don't have done and you can't focus

712
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,629
on the things that you need to work on

713
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:23,190
so if your inbox has like a thousand

714
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,960
things in it you're constantly reviewing

715
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,549
is you're spinning through the other

716
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,620
stuff and it makes your mind wander

717
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:30,570
versus what you need to be working on

718
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,139
and getting it done and going to the

719
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,129
next thing

720
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,570
right so I so I organized my email

721
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,710
through a deal called inbox zero and I

722
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,260
have a link at the end for that as well

723
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,600
too and then I used to duyst

724
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,658
on my phone and I keep track of work

725
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,760
items in home items so my honey to-do

726
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,590
list is on there and my work list is on

727
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,629
there great thing about it is you can

728
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,689
see how many tasks you've completed and

729
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,580
you can say yay me right and it emails

730
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,679
you every day or you can set up your

731
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,139
notifications on on how have stuff to

732
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,960
you alright I have some links that stuff

733
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,490
at the end the third thing this is hard

734
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:10,000
especially with wife and kids you have

735
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:12,400
make time for yourself you have to talk

736
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,970
to your partner and make them understand

737
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,660
that I need some time for myself right

738
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,710
now I like to go the races Chili Bowl

739
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,720
actually two weeks ago got to drive a

740
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:26,020
sprint car it was awesome

741
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,780
ten laps I like building things I turned

742
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,840
that golden tea into a Raspberry Pi

743
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,090
arcade so hooked into the hop switch and

744
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,740
all that stuff it was pretty fun a part

745
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,860
of making time for yourself is also

746
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:43,650
making time for you and your spouse and

747
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:46,300
taking my vacation days we went with a

748
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,640
two other three other couples and spent

749
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,200
a week down in Mexico and enjoyed

750
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,820
ourselves and I came back and went to

751
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,429
work the very next day and it was

752
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,409
awesome like I didn't need a vacation

753
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,290
from the vacation

754
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:01,929
all right fourth this one's awesome

755
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:03,760
positive reflection a lot of us will get

756
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,940
into that drive about how we're terrible

757
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,440
right and if you take a step take ten

758
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,570
minutes 20 minutes and you look at where

759
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,250
you came from and where you're at now

760
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,710
there's a lot of things that we've

761
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,450
achieved that just get tucked back in

762
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,760
there and then you never think about him

763
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,320
again for me I think about like I talked

764
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,929
about earlier I'm the first person in my

765
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,159
family to go to four-year college that's

766
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:25,840
something I should be proud of I

767
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,920
shouldn't like forget about that stuff

768
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,620
right

769
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,780
think about certifications project stuff

770
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,090
like that it kind of seems a little

771
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,399
shallow too but sometimes I'll look

772
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:39,129
through my followers and and there's

773
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,410
some like very nice yeah there's there's

774
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,510
some very like popular like people with

775
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,920
a lot of followers that will actually

776
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,800
talk to me at times I'm like holy shit

777
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,600
you know I must be like I must be doing

778
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,919
something right but seems a little

779
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,928
shallow but it makes me feel good that

780
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,490
you know somebody who like they actually

781
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,650
care what I think

782
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:00,670
and then I read I keep a folder and I

783
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:01,900
put things in there screenshots copies

784
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,490
of emails stuff like that

785
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,059
where I've received things from other

786
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,800
people I have stuff from last jobs that

787
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:10,690
I've worked out where I finished a

788
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,280
project and somebody has said hey Eric

789
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,140
thanks for this you did a great job we

790
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,210
couldn't got this done without you

791
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:20,799
yes I'm saving that into my folder for

792
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:23,570
review later right v I

793
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,799
volunteer I volunteered multiple

794
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,129
different places but I had to pick one

795
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:30,289
place that I really wanted to do one of

796
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:33,590
my one of my friends in college he

797
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:35,120
co-founded Team Rubicon so I go and help

798
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,340
after disaster release through Team

799
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,500
Rubicon I spent eight days down in

800
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,879
Houston two years ago after the

801
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:46,130
hurricane I just did a tornado work in

802
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,440
Lawrence Kansas a few months ago we do

803
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:51,320
service projects do stuff like that it's

804
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,789
great I've got a blog post from 2017

805
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,939
about what that experience looks like

806
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:57,559
because if you think you have it bad and

807
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,510
then you go see people living in a tent

808
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:01,940
city that have lost everything your

809
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:05,379
perspective on life changes pretty darn

810
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:08,000
fast and it'll stick with you alright

811
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:11,149
the last thing I do is what I'm doing

812
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,599
right now I reach out to others okay

813
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:17,779
share my story if I see people that I

814
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,399
think need help I talked to them I don't

815
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,230
take no for an answer if I really

816
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,118
believe they need help I get to know

817
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,339
them stuff like that some people are

818
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,980
gonna just tell you to go jump off a

819
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:30,349
cliff you'll be able to tell by their

820
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,849
responses and stuff like that on if they

821
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:34,099
really need help or not it's something

822
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:37,369
that is very hard to do it takes time to

823
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:38,750
work on you really gotta try to get to

824
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:41,480
know people and techniques on how to

825
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:44,179
communicate with them why is this

826
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,339
important because you'll get some things

827
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:49,820
back out of it - I was having a horrible

828
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:53,599
day one day I just been talking to a

829
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:55,730
company and I was having a really

830
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,250
actually bad week one of the projects I

831
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,930
was on wasn't going well my manager was

832
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,460
being a pain in the rear and stuff like

833
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,020
that and then all of a sudden I got a

834
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,180
direct message on Twitter from somebody

835
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,099
that had said hey I heard you talked

836
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,990
with our company you know my exec said

837
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:10,520

838
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,000

839
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,609

840
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,140
you know I'd love to down the road it's

841
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:18,348
like wow you know like they actually

842
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,750
like me you know and then later that

843
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,339
year a friend in the community I'd

844
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,390
talked to off and on we talked to you

845
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:25,759
about challenges we've been through

846
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:28,940
personally I just texted him a picture

847
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,819
of my family's Christmas card so it is

848
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,470
like hey Steve you know I hope you have

849
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:33,980
a good Christmas you know here's a

850
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,990
picture of our

851
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,400
family he no good and all of a sudden I

852
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,810
get a tweet back to me like that

853
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,230
and I was actually having a horrible day

854
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:43,700
that day I got that just lifted up my

855
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,950
day lifted up the rest of my weekend

856
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,970
made me feel good to take the time to do

857
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:51,500
the little things take its a time to

858
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:55,910
recognize people for doing what they're

859
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:57,800
supposed to be doing right don't be

860
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,960
afraid it's worth the little amount of

861
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,590
time the first time I gave this

862
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,450
presentation last year I was nervous as

863
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:08,960
all could be I barely made it through it

864
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:12,589
I got home that night and this was in my

865
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:16,010
email if you don't think it's worth it

866
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:19,010
it's extremely worth it you could help

867
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,840
that one person that then can help the

868
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:26,119
one person that could then help the one

869
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:29,210
person so I get stuff like this quite

870
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,790
often given this presentation this is my

871
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,080
18th time giving this presentation and I

872
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,570
haven't scheduled two more times next

873
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,770
month

874
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:39,380
one last thing that I've learned over

875
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,300
time giving this is what can managers do

876
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,300
if you're a manager here's some things

877
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,480
you can do how many people know what

878
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:51,560
resources your company have for you if

879
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:56,060
you need to go talk to somebody one yes

880
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,799
- so I didn't know that both as times I

881
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,590
was going through this my actually

882
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:05,240
benefits included therapy sessions for

883
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:07,490
free yours may - if you're a manager or

884
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,959
not check into things like that but

885
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,819
especially if you're a manager know in

886
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,340
case one of your employees comes up to

887
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,780
you know the reporting policy again some

888
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,750
of the things I talked about before the

889
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,190
praised communication look at tasks and

890
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,990
workload distribution don't give

891
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,400
somebody the same task over and over and

892
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:27,580
over again especially if it's a crappy

893
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:31,880
one spread that out all right

894
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:34,340
in conclusion your company isn't gonna

895
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,820
solve this for you you are going to be

896
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:40,130
responsible for your own well-being in

897
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:43,910
this area so look for symptoms in

898
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,650
yourself and others figure out

899
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,868
strategies that work for you I've taken

900
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,759
some things away like working out

901
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:53,180
it's terrible I try to add it back

902
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:55,730
sometimes but it sucks but don't give up

903
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,410
like I said I've worked in and out of

904
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,759
multiple strategies those six that are

905
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:02,359
over there now the ones I do now

906
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:07,039
and lastly pay it forward you never know

907
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:08,740
who needs it or who you might help from

908
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,200
from reaching out

909
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:13,308
lastly the World Health Organization if

910
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,009
you hadn't noticed earlier this year

911
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:18,470
they're actually recognizing burnout

912
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:20,960
it's being added into their list of

913
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:23,959
diagnosis it'll be published in January

914
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,839
2022 so if you see the characterized by

915
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:31,029
three dimensions at the bottom energy

916
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:33,589

negative Oh cynicism yeah it's a peer of

919
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:46,789
sarcasm and reduce professional efficacy

920
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:47,959
