got into InfoSec I'll go over my agenda

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,810
in just a minute but a little bit about

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,660

starting as a senior threat analyst at

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,309
BAE Systems I went to Missouri Baptist

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,890
University here in st. Louis so that's

15
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,209
what brought me to the area that's also

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,129
my Twitter so you might know me from

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,980
there I've met a few people from here

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:49,550
it's been really great so a little

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,319
background about me how I got into IT

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,050
I'm specifically InfoSec and how I got

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,120
interested in this area I actually

22
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,209
started back in high school I did not do

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,070
any computer classes I just saw this one

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,809
movie and I was like oh that looks cool

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,570
it wasn't one of those hacker movies I

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,210
haven't seen really any of those I don't

27
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,240
watch a whole lot of movies but there

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,699
was this girl who's doing intelligence

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,110
work for the military and I was like wow

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,439
that's really cool she knows all the

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,909
stuff she gets to tell them what to do

32
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,320
that sounds like my kind of position and

33
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,060
my dad was like oh so you want to be an

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,679
intelligence officer and I was like sure

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,369
you know whatever like that's what I

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,780
want to do so that led me to obviously

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:36,180
coming here to Missouri Baptist

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:39,000
University pursuing an IT degree so

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,250
while I was doing that between my gen ed

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,950
classes I did what every other college

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,560
student does i binge watch netflix of

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,259
course because i was very bored with my

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,750
life obviously and that's where I found

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,240
Aero and this character up here Felicity

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,610
Smoak because anyone here seen arrow

46
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,310
hopefully one two three four okay a few

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,360
of us so if you don't know her she is

48
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,210
like a badass hacker right so she's like

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,979
wizard level she can she's like your

50
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,000
typical movie hacker she goes in she

51
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,370
like hacks in like five seconds and

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,680
done right she's popped all the boxes I

53
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:18,310
was like oh yeah that's what I want to

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,200
do that's but yeah I want to do that so

55
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,450
I took a few programming classes and I

56
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,679
took a few cybersecurity classes as they

57
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,440
were available and when I came out with

58
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,930
my degree I definitely was not Felicity

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,120
Smoak level I was didn't know what I was

60
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:38,590
doing still I was like C++ hate that

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,970
that's the programming language I start

62
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,480
with that's a whole nother story I can

63
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,620
give a talk about how terrible it is but

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,869
but I thought hey this could still be

65
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,660
fun i T something that has a lot of

66
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,630
different areas so I applied to my old

67
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,020
job now Express Scripts not one year but

68
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,030
two years in a row to about 12 to 15

69
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,940
different IT jobs anything that had AI

70
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,130
tiene information technology I just kind

71
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,290
of sprayed my resume out there I was

72
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,739
like get me in let me do something

73
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,910
please pick me obviously the first year

74
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,880
I didn't get in because I had to apply

75
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,609
for a second year and that's kind of

76
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,140
where it brings us to now so if you

77
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,850
haven't been able to tell by now this is

78
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,708
not a technical talk I'm not going to be

79
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,609
dropping zero-days I'm not going to be

80
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,900
talking about tools but I'm writing this

81
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,610
if you're interested in hearing a

82
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,830
journey from someone early in their

83
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,709
career if you're kind of getting into

84
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,709
information security or if you want to

85
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:39,549
hear journey you know someone be more

86
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,860
empathetic to this kind of thing always

87
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:45,010
I have to point out the views expressed

88
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,750
in this presentation are not necessarily

89
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,690
reflective of my current or past

90
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:53,350
employer this is just the journey in my

91
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,359
story as how I found it so I will be

92
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,269
going over a few different things here

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,910
how I opened the door to InfoSec how I

94
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,769
slammed my door and if my foot in the

95
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,049
door and then how I opened the door

96
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:10,630
again and then some lessons learned and

97
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:13,500
some takeaways so jumping right in as I

98
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,870
told you from my first slide

99
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,579
I pretty much took my resume and just

100
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,489
sprayed it out there I was like I'm

101
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,490
gonna apply to over 12 internships get

102
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,859
rejected probably by all of them right

103
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,620
that's not actually what happened I got

104
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,710
a call back from a development role and

105
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,200
I told them hey I hate coding but I'll

106
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,469
take the job I took it as a learning

107
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,599
opportunity I decided that coding is

108
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,250
something that happens for hackers you

109
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,170
know they definitely have to do that so

110
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:48,600
why not learn so how many of you have

111
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,250
heard of the IT Crowd what all my

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,490
references come from like this very

113
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,320
select few of movies and TVs I've seen

114
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,960
so if you've seen the IT Crowd which

115
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,390
sees like a lot of us have I was gen I

116
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,960
felt like I got this job because I could

117
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:06,300
open emails respond to emails delete

118
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,190
emails that kind of thing I wasn't very

119
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,530
technically sound - like I said I took a

120
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:17,070
C++ class and a c-sharp class both hated

121
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:20,099
barely passed but I was stronger with my

122
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,740
soft skills so I was very confident I

123
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,410
went in I actually made a full stack web

124
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,000
site did the front-end back-end did all

125
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,470
that fancy stuff made it look really

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,410
pretty and it's something that they

127
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,470
still use today so it's really cool and

128
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,180
then something that was really great as

129
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,030
during this internship I was assigned a

130
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,270
mentor so a peer mentor so she actually

131
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,799
helped me she was like every every week

132
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,849
she would check in and be like hey so do

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,140
you like coding yet and I was like no

134
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,220
like for 12 weeks straight she'd be like

135
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,890
so do you like it yeah and I'll be like

136
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,020
no you like it let no but what was

137
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,969
really great as I told her like oh hey I

138
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,130
want to do this thing cyber security

139
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,230
information security whatever everyone

140
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,640
calls it what the kids are calling it

141
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,520
these days

142
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,890
so she helped me meet with all of the

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,740
senior managers directors senior

144
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,870
directors and are seaso at the company

145
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,610
that I was working with at the time I've

146
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,010
got to sit down with them for 30 minutes

147
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,180
have a one-on-one kind of talk talk to

148
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,030
them tell them about my passions

149
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,370
I was interested in and this really

150
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,619
helped networking my way and to like

151
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:30,280
figure out what I could possibly be

152
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:35,190
interested in so I like to say that I

153
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:38,138
talked my way into my next position so I

154
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,169
went on from my deposition in the summer

155
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:45,310
to a Red Team position and I was like

156
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:47,320
finally I get to be a hacker right it

157
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,750
was a big leap though obviously I had

158
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,719
only like I previously said taken one or

159
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,190
two cybersecurity classes I had stood up

160
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,570
this website that everyone was impressed

161
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,250
with but I didn't even know how it

162
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:03,099
worked I had a lot of help I was kind of

163
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:04,389
swimming in the deep end for sure so and

164
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,340
I definitely was like this grandma at

165
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,260
the top I was like oh my gosh I found

166
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,310
default passwords and these websites you

167
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,229
guys it's so cool when everyone else was

168
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,440
like popping real boxes I was sitting in

169
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,789
the corner I like cheering on I talked

170
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,570
about this because I was challenging

171
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:24,130
myself it was very far behind and all my

172
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,120
basics because I didn't know what I was

173
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,849
doing it was like a someone trying to

174
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,550
firehose of knowledge on for me and I

175
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:36,010
was like slowly but surely drowning so

176
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,789
even though I found a few default

177
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:42,820
passwords I wasn't doing anything

178
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:45,789
remotely exciting right this led to

179
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:49,210
actually a lot of self-deprecation so I

180
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:53,320
was on this team for about five months

181
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:59,138
and during this time a lot of tears were

182
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:02,889
spilled sorry I'm actually sick so

183
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:05,139
there'll be a lot of drinking but I was

184
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,310
on a very technically sound team who

185
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,650
really know what they're doing and

186
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:13,479
didn't know how to coach me up so I was

187
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:15,909
kind of the intern who was like hey you

188
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,039
told me how does how do we get from like

189
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,470
putting google.com and then what happens

190
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:24,520
like having to learn like the very low

191
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:27,580
level stuff to a team who's like meanie

192
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,669
cats and all those big things Kerberos

193
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,009
ting golden-ticket passing

194
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:36,309
you know those big ticket items so I was

195
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:37,599
definitely in over my head and this is

196
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,179
kind of where I first learned about the

197
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,669
bell curve of knowledge and if you don't

198
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:44,109
know what this is I like to point kind

199
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,879
of explain it like this you have like a

200
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,379
bell curve and at the beginning you

201
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,389
don't know what you don't know so that

202
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:50,769
was my dev opportunity I didn't know

203
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,860
anything I thought hey this sounded

204
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,470
really cool right and then when I was on

205
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,720
the red team I kind of peeked and I'm my

206
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,810
peaked I mean I learned all the areas I

207
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,110
didn't know about so I didn't know about

208
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:08,079
Mimi Katz I didn't know about a B I

209
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,970
didn't know about the network and that

210
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:13,300
really scared me and it really beat down

211
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,800
on me obviously the end is you know what

212
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,508
you know but I obviously wasn't there

213
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,389
yet so I didn't know what to ask for

214
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:24,519
didn't know how to ask her what I needed

215
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,680
didn't know how to like coach myself I

216
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,800
was in a really hard time kind of

217
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,109
started beating down on myself because I

218
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,880
felt really stupid so I felt like I

219
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,800
slammed the foot my foot in the door I

220
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,970
was like great I got this great

221
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,589
opportunity to become a felicity smoak I

222
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,100
have this opportunity to get an info SEC

223
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:48,250
and blowing it I'm gonna be fired who

224
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,110
knows what and then December of last

225
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,630
year I got the opportunity to move on to

226
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:57,490
a blue team and this is kind of where I

227
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:59,050
start opening the door again so when

228
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,759
they told me that I would be moving on

229
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:05,920
to a blue team I was like oh why I was

230
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,569
very anxious I was like I've heard all

231
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,939
the back and forth between blue and red

232
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:13,599
I wasn't very excited to do something

233
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:15,790
less technical I was kind of like the

234
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,860
girl the top is like thanks but no

235
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,329
thanks I think I'm finally maybe getting

236
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,630
the hang of red team you should just

237
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:25,290
hold on to me a little longer so I was

238
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,620
equally and hopeful and equally nervous

239
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,819
but I did learn a lot through this so I

240
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,439
realized that I was a very task-oriented

241
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:34,430
person not something I had on the

242
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:37,300
previous team

243
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,280
and this was something I had gotten from

244
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,260
my new team and they had a lot of

245
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,870
documentation already put in place and

246
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:49,460
my manager was really good at letting me

247
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:53,630
develop those something else I wanted to

248
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:55,070
mention is that I had an advocate

249
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,490
working for me while I was on the red

250
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,000
team

251
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,950
he had that my best interest in mind for

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,770
me and would talk to my old director on

253
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,540
my behalf a lot so anytime I would come

254
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,980
back to my cubicle and just kind of like

255
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,390
sniffle in the corner he would come up

256
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,370
to me be like what's wrong good I'd be

257
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,960
like it's nothing he'd be like no what's

258
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,820
wrong and I was like I feel really

259
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,290
stupid like I can't firewalk our main

260
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,020
dot-com like there's something wrong

261
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,670
with me and he was like Alexis no one

262
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,980
can do that that's impossible we would

263
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,360
be breached so he really gave me those

264
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,160
sanity checks and I was really grateful

265
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,810
that he became my new manager on this

266
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,939
team actually someone I got to know from

267
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,500
networking over the summer so he sat me

268
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,910
down at the beginning of this rotation

269
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,620
and he got real with me he noticed that

270
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,449
my confidence was not on the level I had

271
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,490
been over the summer he noticed those

272
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,070
self-deprecating tendencies that I had

273
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,500
had and he pointed it all out to me

274
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,650
which of course at first I was like

275
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,650
excuse you what do you mean how rude of

276
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,209
you but then I had to give myself a self

277
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,430
check and just be like okay no he like

278
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,390
obviously means this for the best and I

279
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,829
was being terrible and hard on myself so

280
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,260
he did a really good job of easing me

281
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,770
into this role instead of fire hosing me

282
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,480
with information and being overwhelmed

283
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,130
another amazing thing he did was started

284
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,590
told me that I should start talking with

285
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,790
women and technology this is not

286
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:23,319
something I thought was valuable before

287
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,988
I was like it doesn't matter we're all

288
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,399
in technology together but he made me

289
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:29,410
realize that they might have similar

290
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:34,269
stories and he couldn't support me in

291
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:36,040
ways that they could so through this I

292
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:38,829
found actually had more mentors and more

293
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,149
sponsors that I knew besides him who

294
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:44,229
were working on my behalf behind the

295
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:47,350
scenes it was a really great feeling

296
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,139
coming from such a self like deprecating

297
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,179
and low point of my life to sitting down

298
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:54,850
with one woman who viewed me as a beacon

299
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:57,009
of hope for woman in technology and she

300
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,689
said that she believed that I could have

301
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,819
a seat at the table one day like I

302
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,769
literally just like cried I was like oh

303
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:04,599
my gosh I thought I was gonna be fired

304
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:09,399
and you're here thinking I could be a

305
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:11,679
seaso which is what I want to do another

306
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,059
woman I suggest I met with suggested I

307
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,329
get more involved with our employee

308
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:20,559
resource groups so I joined two women

309
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:23,349
and Technology women over the whole

310
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,059
corporation subcommittees one for lean

311
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,689
and circle is one for celebrating women

312
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:30,160
which was really empower empowering

313
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:33,248
another one that I got involved with was

314
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,079
women of st. Louis so those are women of

315
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:37,600
different corporations come together and

316
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:41,888
we do a lot of learning about once a

317
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,289
quarter roughly not only was that great

318
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,089
to network you know with women but also

319
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:48,489
women outside of my company women

320
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:50,199
outside of my position I'm something I

321
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:51,939
had not mentioned up until now as I was

322
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,219
the first and only female in each of

323
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:59,349
these positions so I didn't really have

324
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,789
that representation to look at so slowly

325
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,959
but surely this helped me gain my

326
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:03,789
confidence back

327
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,459
obviously nothing is sunshine and

328
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:08,769
rainbows unfortunately halfway through

329
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:12,128
this rotation my biggest sponsor mentor

330
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:14,049
my managers left because we were going

331
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:21,519
through a merger at the time and decided

332
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:23,289
to leave the company luckily though you

333
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,809
know I have most of my team is remote at

334
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:28,779
the time I did have a very good group of

335
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:30,789
guys who supported me honestly the

336
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,079
sweetest group of guys they always would

337
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:32,500
tell me like hey you're doing a really

338
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,329
good

339
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,100
or hey this looks really nice just

340
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,380
improve this instead of like eating down

341
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,320
on me

342
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,110
so eventually with I learned with a lot

343
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,520
of guidance from my co-workers how to

344
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,260
perform my job like them and work is

345
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,079
like I was a regular employee cuz I was

346
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:57,580
still an intern during the time this is

347
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:59,620
back in like April I think and I

348
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,270
actually had forgotten the main reason

349
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,030
that I got into technology was to become

350
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:07,060
an Intel analyst until I was wearing

351
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:09,510
this presentation so I actually ended up

352
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:14,890
in my real dream job not the hacker

353
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:16,810
fantasy that I thought I wanted so as I

354
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,939
mentioned our company was going through

355
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,790
a merger and I was told that I might not

356
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,680
have a position so not only were the

357
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,569
networking great for just like knowing

358
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,910
other women and having shared stories

359
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,190
but I also was able to like look outside

360
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,199
the company um I did end up staying as a

361
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,390
full-time employee for a few months but

362
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,820
it was something that was really nice to

363
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:40,569
have in the back of my pocket I'm in my

364
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:48,010
llenan or in my LinkedIn circles to fall

365
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:49,930
back on but why so this is my story but

366
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:54,310
why does it matter why do I get up here

367
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:56,020
and talk about my failures right I've

368
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,410
obviously highlighted some of my lowest

369
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,000
lows and none of really my highs like I

370
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,770
said with my dev team my stuff this

371
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,800
website that I'm still very proud of to

372
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:07,630
the day and on the red team you know I

373
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,750
did do some campaigns I did do some

374
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:13,180
retest it wasn't all failures on the

375
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,620
blue team obviously it was pretty

376
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,150
amazing learning about threat

377
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:21,310
intelligence and now where a lot of but

378
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,600
I did take a lot of learning from my

379
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,180
failures so that's why I kind of

380
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,810
highlight them today so here's what I

381
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:31,060
learned the first thing I learned is

382
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,770
networking and this is what you do -

383
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,290
from the door after you your phone the

384
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:37,530
door right

385
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,569
I want to highlight this specifically

386
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,670
from my first story because I would have

387
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,530
not gotten to information security by

388
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,839
sitting at my desk and coding all day I

389
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,730
also just wouldn't have fallen back and

390
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,070
had the mentors and sponsors I would

391
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,320
have had who advocated on my behalf

392
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:56,220
without me even knowing without doing

393
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,960
this from day one I like to talk a lot

394
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,690
or joke with a lot of people that I talk

395
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,060
to my way into formation security which

396
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:06,990
I totally believe I really didn't have

397
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:10,440
any credentials up until actually

398
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,940
getting in right I only had dev working

399
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,570
before that I worked in like restaurant

400
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:19,760
industries so my resume wasn't very

401
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:23,069
impressive but my passions my skills

402
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,230
that I could manage those are what

403
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,300
really set me apart the fact that I

404
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,090
would go in there and be like I want to

405
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,360
learn so this is really important you

406
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,189
have to sell yourself I took this lesson

407
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,620
with every team that I went to and this

408
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,450
is why I've ended up where I am my old

409
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,899
manager from my blue team was my

410
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:45,330
advocate because of the networking so

411
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,950
it's never a bad time or a bad idea to

412
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,649
reach out to people connect on LinkedIn

413
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,140
and meet others around your company or

414
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,940
even outside when I was interviewing for

415
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,620
other companies I used my networks to

416
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,170
find other jobs to match what I've done

417
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,159
much what I want to do and then also get

418
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:05,610
an inside scoop on companies that I

419
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,690
possibly was interested in so one

420
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,179
question I've gotten on this

421
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:12,330
specifically is how how do I take this

422
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,520
leap into networking I do have a

423
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,810
procedure that I like to follow I think

424
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,310
it's really easy and it's very effective

425
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:20,100
I've given this advice to a lot of

426
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:22,950
people actually most recently an intern

427
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:27,600
that I got to mentor this last summer so

428
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,710
it's a couple couples like steps so the

429
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,780
first step is you want to obviously

430
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,500
scoop out people who impress you we're

431
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,680
an InfoSec Osten isn't that hard we all

432
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,660
can look around and notice people right

433
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,460
so I would say pick like three to five

434
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,920
people around your office or outside

435
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,760
your office that you know are in the

436
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,220
areas that you're interested in and

437
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,690
after you find out who you think you

438
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,340
could talk to

439
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,900
I suggest then going to them and

440
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,990
introducing yourself in your background

441
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,600
so hi I'm Alexis

442
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,520
I work in dev and I worked in Fred then

443
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,500
I worked in blue this is what I'm

444
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:10,940
working on now I'm really interested in

445
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:12,460
XYZ very short keep it very brief next

446
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,350
thing you want to do is compliment them

447
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,420
hey so-and-so told me that you're really

448
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,149
good at this I'm interested in learning

449
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:23,330
more about that hey I noticed this about

450
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,370
you hey this this and this people

451
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,760
respond really really well to

452
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,010
compliments and then after that ask them

453
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,510
how they got to that position so yeah I

454
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,840
saw you're really good at this how'd you

455
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:38,860
get there what's your background what's

456
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,850
your area of business really focus on

457
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,679
once you start asking people about

458
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,840
themselves trust me they'll open up and

459
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,730
talk people I've noticed people like

460
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:52,070
talking about themselves which is kind

461
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:54,410
of why I'm up here right and then then

462
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,970
after all that that should just take a

463
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,070
few minutes sometimes you can fill up a

464
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,020
30-minute slot if you want to the last

465
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,030
and most important thing is is you ask

466
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,129
okay so now who do you think I should go

467
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:07,490
talk to who knows more than you do

468
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,380
or who knows more about this area that

469
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,970
helps by getting about another three to

470
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,980
five people so therefore you're just

471
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:17,270
like exponentially growing your network

472
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,740
the important thing is is even if you're

473
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:22,850
uncomfortable you need to reach out to

474
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,410
people reaching out being like I said

475
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,199
the first and only female in each of my

476
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:29,810
team so it's really important to connect

477
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,560
with people on a different level

478
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:35,270
I hate golfing I don't play video games

479
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:40,669
I'm very boring I sit at home I have a

480
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:43,639
cat so I didn't really bond with the

481
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:46,520
guys on my team as much as other guys

482
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,950
did right or other guys coming in so it

483
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,360
was all I had to figure out and notice

484
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,480
little things that I could connect with

485
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,310
them on it was even harder because I

486
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,620
don't I don't have kids I'm not married

487
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,820
like you you really have to like notice

488
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,080
people

489
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:05,629
we've a narrative about you know how you

490
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,370
can connect another big thing is

491
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:11,710
inviting them to coffee or lunch that's

492
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:14,120
another big thing that I would suggest

493
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,220
because like if you're shy if you're a

494
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,020
woman if you're the minority your

495
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,750
interests aren't always going to line up

496
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,850
with the people around you but the good

497
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,070
thing is you have in common work if you

498
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,270
work with them

499
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,919
and also if you don't have a mentor

500
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,889
assigned to you like I did this is a

501
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,720
great one to find one seek one out a lot

502
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,460
of people sometimes don't have the time

503
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,180
but are willing to point you in the

504
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,720
right direction

505
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,460
so really you should be expanding your

506
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,810
network look for org charts you know

507
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,160
LinkedIn these are all really good

508
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,810
materials to do that the next thing I

509
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,140
want to talk about is changing the

510
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:57,800
workplace another survey who's who here

511
00:21:51,140 --> 00:22:02,030
has seen Perl by Pixar one person that's

512
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,980
typically how it goes so this isn't

513
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,320
actually too old but I can give you a

514
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:10,010
little blurb about what pearl is so this

515
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,950
was taken from short of the week blog so

516
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:17,300
set in high-powered world of burrow

517
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,980
capital er no pearl falls its central

518
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,810
character as she goes to work in a

519
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,510
male-dominated office and finds herself

520
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,860
struggling to fit in a story centered

521
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,870
around themes of belonging and

522
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,449
understanding pearls left with a tough

523
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,399
decision change her ways to fit in or

524
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:36,650
carry on being herself and face a life

525
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:39,260
of loneliness and isolation at work kind

526
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,760
of hits home for some of us like I just

527
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,310
said you're not always going to fit in

528
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,960
with everyone that you work with and if

529
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,300
you can see here obviously she changed

530
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,870
herself

531
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:54,050
sorry to spoil it but so this little

532
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:56,929
barn for y'all Bart y'all I can't speak

533
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,000
today ball of yarn comes in right she's

534
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,620
pink everyone's wearing suits and she

535
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,510
notices she doesn't get invited out to

536
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,909
dinner she doesn't get invited out to

537
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,530
the bar after work to happy hour and she

538
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,210
was like what the heck like I'm doing my

539
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,550
work just the same no one's listening to

540
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,780
me no one's listening to my ideas so she

541
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,330
knits herself

542
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,280
obviously and once she changes people

543
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,070
start listening to her people start

544
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,700
inviting her places and soil alert at

545
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:26,580
the end a yellow ball of yarn walks in

546
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,920
the same as her all excited ready to go

547
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,899
and she realizes oh shoot I've changed

548
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,910
myself and I don't want her to have to

549
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,180
change yourself as well we should be

550
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:38,790
more inclusive so I mentioned this

551
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,990
because of my burnout kind of in the

552
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,379
second one

553
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,260
I had been at such a low point my very

554
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,210
short career I should say but because I

555
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,090
changed myself I became this girl who

556
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,720
was the dumb intern I had to change

557
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:59,100
myself to be the one to fit in just so I

558
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:02,520
could belong in the space changing in

559
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,320
the workplace obviously if you haven't

560
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,820
seen this as it's gonna hit home more

561
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,100
than my words but it's also just a

562
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:16,020
really important part to remember for

563
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,280
actually another later slide so another

564
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,110
thing I learned if you haven't learned

565
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,610
it already is I didn't realize how

566
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,219
difficult it could be being the only

567
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,840
woman on every team I had been on it

568
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,490
wasn't until my last role until I

569
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,020
realized that having women in my corner

570
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:32,070
is something that can be both empowering

571
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,770
and inspirational even just sitting down

572
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,280
with women someone listening to their

573
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:40,590
story how they got to where they are

574
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,060
here what they love and what it can all

575
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,649
just be really good information when

576
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,940
you're needed the workforce not only

577
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,330
women there's also great men out there

578
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,610
with good stories as well but I've heard

579
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,379
a lot of same kind of horrific stories

580
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,030
from women and so when they can validate

581
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:59,700
your own horrific stories it's very

582
00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:01,110
empowering and this often gives you a

583
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,550
support system you didn't know you

584
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:08,070
needed so this shows this see so

585
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:10,620
demographics of the top fortune 100 list

586
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:13,080
now this might not be important for some

587
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,689
people but for some of us that want to

588
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,830
be CSO's in the next I don't know 10

589
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,890
years

590
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:23,909
this is kind of scary just because 89%

591
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:26,490
of CISOs are men which means I have yet

592
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:29,970
to see a sea so and I've gone through

593
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:33,330
three now who's female who I can look up

594
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:35,910
to the highest position that I've seen a

595
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,820
female at in my department would be

596
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:42,120
director and we had about a million of

597
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:45,149
those so that wasn't very shocking

598
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,620
so representation can't matter I don't

599
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,670
want to get on a soapbox and talk about

600
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,969
this all day because that could be a

601
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,960
different talk but this is just

602
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,520
something that I like to highlight

603
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,820
because it's it's hard when you don't

604
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,570
see people at the top or people next to

605
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,250
you so this kind of all ties back into

606
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,800
learning about your brand and learning

607
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,400
about yourself so I learned obviously

608
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,379
from my second story that I learned

609
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,370
about my communication styles how I like

610
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,450
to learn different things about myself I

611
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,010
like to it worked what didn't work

612
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,260
without me what kind of structure I

613
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:23,060
needed and how to deal with people who

614
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,060
communicated differently than I did

615
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,710
along with these things I was forced to

616
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:30,630
brand rebrand and then re rebrand myself

617
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,900
I think we talk about branding and

618
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,940
InfoSec a lot we beat that dead horse by

619
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,410
time I think I've heard about a million

620
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,820
stories on branding so I'm not gonna

621
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:43,950
spend too long on this but I had my

622
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,740
personal brand going onto my first team

623
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,270
as a very confident bold intern who's

624
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,390
not afraid to let people know that she

625
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,879
wanted to be see so I was very outspoken

626
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:56,550
very loud I didn't care what people

627
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,430
thought I knew I was going to do great

628
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,350
work and I was there to do it and then

629
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,240
on my second team like I mentioned

630
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,990
before I felt like I had to rebrand

631
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,840
myself to the guys and be this cool very

632
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:13,290
dumb girl right I was surrounded by

633
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,220
InfoSec what we call rockstars very

634
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:20,220
smart people honestly but I didn't know

635
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,540
how to personally relate to them so the

636
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,180
best way I knew how to do that was to

637
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,330
make myself the dumb cool girl who we

638
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,860
could all make fun of

639
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,960
so everyone loves Mike making fun of me

640
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,570
which was fine right I love it happen

641
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,070
and then on my last team I had a RiRi

642
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,559
brand myself and I had to have that

643
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,659
wake-up call with my manager who pointed

644
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:41,190
out that I'd lost my confidence and then

645
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,400
I didn't want to be the weak dumb girl

646
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:47,130
on the team anymore so I point this out

647
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,320
just because you think you might know

648
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,710
your brand but it's easy to lose that in

649
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,110
InfoSec I think because of the vision

650
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,760
that you want so you know going and I

651
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,559
was like I want to be this hacker so if

652
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,110
I'm gonna be on the hacking team I have

653
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,879
to be the dumb girl right and that's not

654
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:08,030
who I am

655
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:10,110
so definitely learn a lot about that and

656
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,340
then the last thing I want to leave you

657
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,740
with is that your journey it's not gonna

658
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,120
be straight nor smooth so I think that's

659
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,179
quite obvious about my journey today

660
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,340
it's kind of all over the place but it

661
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,990
got me to where I am today I've heard

662
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,610
this from a lot of people and nothing

663
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:28,920
happens how you expect it to be but

664
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:31,020
that's totally okay two things that I

665
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,210
want to tie together with this journey

666
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,639
is impostor syndrome and tiara syndrome

667
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,350
I think impostor syndrome is talked

668
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,580
about a lot in the InfoSec community

669
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,689
it's when you know you don't realize how

670
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,850
far you've come and that's definitely

671
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,550
where I was in that second story the

672
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:49,709
also tiara syndrome I thought if I kept

673
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,000
my head down all day did my work that

674
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,410
someone would come in place that tiara

675
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,820
on my head and that's not how it always

676
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,170
happens and that kind of goes back to

677
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,230
the networking piece that you really

678
00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:02,190
have to go out there and sell yourself

679
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:04,740
so this you know obviously encapsulates

680
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,679
my journey this is my own and everyone's

681
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,630
going to be different here so I

682
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,059
encourage everyone to talk about their

683
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,730
journeys reach out to me that's totally

684
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:16,649
fine reach out to each other really get

685
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,090
talking because we're not gonna

686
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,710
understand what each other is going

687
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:23,790
through until we talk about it and it's

688
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,750
not always easy to talk about and one

689
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,000
thing with this is I've definitely

690
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:29,400
talked a lot about women in technology

691
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,440
sharing their stories but it's important

692
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,850
for men to talk about their experiences

693
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,080
as well because we don't see them

694
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,919
talking a whole lot to each other

695
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,590
nowadays

696
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,630
so hopefully by listening to my shuttles

697
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,570
you can see that it's possible to get

698
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,280
through it and that even if you're not

699
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:47,669
struggling that maybe the person sitting

700
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,800
next to you is so follow me on Twitter

701
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,730
to see my crazy life but other than that

702
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,730
thank you so much

703
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,579
[Applause]
