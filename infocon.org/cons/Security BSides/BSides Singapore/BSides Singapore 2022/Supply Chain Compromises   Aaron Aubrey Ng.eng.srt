I'm very excited to be back here again

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,340
uh to be you know speaking to this

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,860

awesome to be back here again uh part of

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,000
me does you know was hoping that this

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,740
year we will do it uh we will do besides

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,779
in person but I guess uh unfortunately

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,519
you know we are still gonna stick with

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,140
virtual for another year so I you know I

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,779

16
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,340
hope that you know we will get to meet

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,239
in person uh next year right but anyway

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,520
let's get started with um the the topic

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,020
that I would like to share with the

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,700
community today and that's none other

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,559
than on the topic of supply chain

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,020
compromises uh it is what I believe to

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,300
be a very pertinent security issue today

24
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,879
and I really hope you know to unpack

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,440
right the concept of supply chain

26
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,140
compromises uh for this community and

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,940
also you know at a close to the end of

28
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,739
my presentation today I will also share

29
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,840
some general like recommendations right

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,820
in terms of how you know if you are

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,440
thinking about supply chain compromises

32
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,000
how what are some of the Practical

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,220
recommendations you can consider right

34
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,500
uh to defend you know your organization

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,960
right against this uh increasingly

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,939
pernicious threat right that is

37
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,439
affecting like the security Community

38
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,960
around the world today right before I do

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,640
that I just want to quickly uh offer a

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,680
formal introduction of myself

um so again good morning I'm Aaron I'm a

years now and prior to this I spent the

48
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,100
vast majority of my career my earlier

53
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,899
served tours in the military

54
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,240
intelligence organization and also

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,820
helped to form the damn Nation defense

56
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,880
cyber organization in Singapore

57
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,340
um about four or five years ago right so

58
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,840
I left the private I left for the

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,820
private sector now about four years ago

60
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,639
and ever since then I have been

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,739
working directly with you know

62
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,319
organizations both in the private and in

63
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,540
the public sector right to help them you

64
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,220
know understand you know what are some

65
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,660
of the pertinent threats that they

66
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,160
should be concerned with for the

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,900
organization right for their contacts

68
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,940
and also help them right think about how

69
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,980
they would go about you know developing

70
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,140
right attract intelligence program right

71
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,420
in their organization right to best

72
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,459
enable right their security processes

73
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,800
and their security organization

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,900
right and in my free time

75
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,459
um you would see me

76
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,840
um you know at time to time you know

77
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,060
volunteer in in in the security

78
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,860
community in different parts of the

79
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,660
security community in this part of the

80
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,780
world uh I in my when I had more free

81
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,180
time right I I like to spend some of my

82
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,040
free time helping out with the sense

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,959
community in Singapore

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,180
um right which uh yeah which I've really

85
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,459
you know met a lot of great contexts and

86
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,200
friends over the years and you know

87
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,940
similarly you know participate in

88
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,560
communities such as besides Singapore

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,900
which I'm very proud to be part of

90
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,840
so let's get started in the content like

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,060
proper and really I just wanted to start

92
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,879
with this very simple like Safe Harbor

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,459
um Converse statement right because um

94
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,500
you know we want to because I'm going to

95
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,840
be talking about some of the the content

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,180
that is uh that is potentially a bit

97
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,580
more sensitive because it may

98
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,500
um it speaks to

99
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,140
some of the proprietary engagements that

100
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,700
crowdstrike is involved in in the field

101
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,680
but I just want to share that you know

102
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,540
what I'm gonna be speaking to today is

103
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,459
going to be you know largely derived

104
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,799
from our intelligence reporting and

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,120
public sources

106
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,940
um in the to respect right our our the

107
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,799
custom privacy of our customers right

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,780
there would be no content that I would

109
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,159
share that would come that would be

110
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,659
derived from our incident response

111
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,540
engagements right and similarly I'm also

112
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,920
not going to be able to answer any

113
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
questions right uh around like specifics

114
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,239
around how crowdstrike performs incident

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
response and any of the dealings that we

116
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,620
any of the information right that is

117
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,180
gleaned from directly from our incident

118
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,340
response engagements right this is to

119
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,260
protect right the privacy of our

120
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,000
customers

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,040
right and of course

122
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,079
you know just to give everyone here an

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,120
overview of what I'm going to be

124
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,978
speaking to today but I'm going to be

125
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,500
starting like this conversation with an

126
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,360
overview of you know what Supply

127
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,040
compromises what supply chain

128
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,320
compromises are about right then I will

129
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,759
speak to

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,220
you know a particularly prolific example

131
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,380
of a Sebastian compromise right a

132
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,720
crowdstrike we track it as the Stellar

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,759
particle activity cluster right more on

134
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,919
that very shortly right then after that

135
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,840
I will you know expand the conversation

136
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,940
to talk about you know in in general

137
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,740
right what are the different ways right

138
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,419
in which a supply chain can be

139
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,100
compromised right so speaking to the

140
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,840
attack factors that can Target a supply

141
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,940
chain right and looking at some of the

142
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,800
prolific examples right in recent

143
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,500
history right and and then finally we

144
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,360
will close up today's conversation right

145
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,160
by looking at you know what are some of

146
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,199
the Practical recommendations right that

147
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,139
an organization can consider right to

148
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,180
improve right or enhance right your

149
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,820
supply chain security right given the

150
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,620
current situation that we find ourselves

151
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,199
in right in the modern thread landscape

152
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,540
so let's begin right with a quick

153
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,860
introduction to what supply chain

154
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,080
compressors are about

155
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,560
right and really this slight intense you

156
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,180
know is intended at you know

157
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,520
articulating right the key

158
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,500
characteristics right that's typically

159
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
associated with a supply chain

160
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,979
compromise right first and foremost

161
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,880
right it exploits some form right of an

162
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,880
up of a trust right implicit trust right

163
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,919
that an organization has right in their

164
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,620
supply chain right oftentimes it you

165
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,780
know adversaries would exploit right or

166
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,180
will leverage right an upstream like

167
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,460
vendor or provider right in order to

168
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,479
achieve right you know that that

169
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,940
downward stream access right to often

170
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,220
times numerous organizations that it

171
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,259
intends to Target right so first and

172
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,539
foremost right the one of the core

173
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,680
characteristics of a supply chain

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,720
compromise is that it exploits right

175
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,280
Upstream Trust

176
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,560
the second core characteristics of

177
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,720
supply chain compromises is that it's

178
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,460
often associated with a long time

179
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,800
Horizon right supply chain compromises

180
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,380
right oftentimes when when adversaries

181
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,940
are thinking about leveraging a supply

182
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,280
chain compromise to achieve right the

183
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,740
intended objectives right oftentimes

184
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,380
right we see this like we see supply

185
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,300
chain comparisons associated with

186
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,280
state-sponsored adversaries right and

187
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,960
state sponsored adversaries are often

188
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,220
primarily motivated by Espionage right

189
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,560
motivation right they are there to you

190
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,100
know spy on on on sensitive information

191
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,500
right that would help influence like

192
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,440
foreign policy like making decisions or

193
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,180
you know it's they are often there right

194
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,460
in certain cases certain States also

195
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,979
partake in intellectual property theft

196
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,600
or what is otherwise known as industrial

197
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,580
Espionage where they are you know

198
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,940
concerned or motivated to steal right

199
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,919
large throws of sensitive information

200
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,620
associated with an organization right

201
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,660
that helps they can then help to Spur

202
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,240
domestic Innovation right and oftentimes

203
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,819
the nature of this campaigns right

204
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,819
require long-term access right to a

205
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,860
victim organization right so once again

206
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,380
right it often right involves supply

207
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,300
chain compromises often involves

208
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,699
long-time Horizons and last but not

209
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,720
least

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,660
like kind of associated to that previous

211
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,819
point about long-time Horizons is the

212
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,280
core characteristic of clandestine right

213
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,880
excess or covert access right because

214
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,319
oftentimes right as I've mentioned in

215
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,880
the in the early examples that I

216
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,319
provided right in the form of political

217
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,479
Espionage and Industrial Espionage right

218
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,580
in order for the adversary to be

219
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,440
effective right they cannot be caught

220
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,720
right they cannot be caught that they

221
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,960
yeah to kind of keep it on the down low

222
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,660
in order to maintain access long-term

223
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,699
access right in the victim environment

224
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,979
so that they can achieve right they are

225
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,860
intended objectives right so Upstream

226
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,960
trust right long time Horizons and

227
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,940
clandestine access right are the core

228
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,500
characteristics of a supply chain

229
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,300
compromise

230
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,759
so now let's move on to you know let's

231
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,740
unpack this further and like let's spend

232
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,720
a few moments looking at why is it so

233
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,819
difficult right to detect a supply chain

234
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,520
attack right so I'm hope I'm gonna use

235
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,259
this few like Graphics right to explain

236
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,020
you know that the difficulty

237
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,760
so first and foremost right you know

238
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,500
let's look at some of the common attack

239
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,059
other attack vectors that we are so

240
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,860
familiar with so

241
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,360
let's look at an example of a phishing

242
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,520
attack right oftentimes a phishing

243
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,080
attack right can be easily detected

244
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,060
right and you know in most instances

245
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,800
blocked right before effective email

246
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,779
Gateway right or you know even a web

247
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,300
proxy right that's deployed right in a

248
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,980
security environment

249
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,260
by next we look at you know a pot scan

250
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,660
right an example when adversary is

251
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,860
looking at you know potentially

252
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,240
performing some kind of reconnaissance

253
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,060
right or be or you know or some kind of

254
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,440
like you know victim environment

255
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,899
enumeration before they start to uh

256
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,459
before they proceed with their attempt

257
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,080
to achieve initial access right

258
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
similarly if you have the appropriate

259
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,339
like firewall settings like an

260
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,380
appropriate firewalls or network like

261
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,839
parameter devices uh deployed right

262
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,519
you're able to detect and defend against

263
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,560
such attempts

264
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,839
let's look at you know an attempt to

265
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,000
achieve actual initial access right and

266
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,740
one of the most common ways to do it

267
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,440
right is you know a crime tactic right

268
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,480
of of using a banking Trojan right to

269
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,040
achieve the initial access some kind of

270
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,680
commodity malware right or some kind of

271
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,420
malware like an IMO tab right and so and

272
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,360
so forth right and similarly right in in

273
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,459
most mature organizations today right if

274
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,940
you have a A ngav or EDR sensor that's

275
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,620
deployed right in your environment right

276
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,779
you know that AV or the EDR is going to

277
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,580
be effectively pick up you know that

278
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,779
it's going to detect their banking

279
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,700
Trojan and effectively prevent an attack

280
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,300
from happening

281
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,980
right and as I mentioned right a supply

282
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,380
chain attack typically kind of you know

283
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,500
exploits right the trust that a victim

284
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,300
organization has right in a third party

285
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,060
provider right and in basically instead

286
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,920
of targeting the victim organization

287
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,380
directly it actually goes kind of like

288
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,459
around right that that around takes a

289
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,440
roundabout right and basically ex you

290
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,019
know exploits the implicit trust that

291
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,660
the adverse that the victim has in the

292
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,399
third party provider right and Achieve

293
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,500
access right into the victim right so

294
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,140
there's really no perfect right you know

295
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,660
security solution right or traditional

296
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,360
security solution to this problem right

297
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
and not only that right oftentimes right

298
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,519
we also see a supply chain attack right

299
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,500
being you know effective right because

300
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,140
it has that ability to exploit you know

301
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,360
access you know in a one-to-many

302
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,860
situation right where you know a

303
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,620
successful Bridge right a successful

304
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,779
access to a third party provider right

305
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,500
would see a situation where one at one

306
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,360
one successful attack is going to be

307
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,940
able to affect you know countless of

308
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,940
Downstream victims right so that and

309
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,380
through that right oftentimes you would

310
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,300
see you know multiple back doors right

311
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,000
being deployed right both at the initial

312
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,160
victim and also across all the

313
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,720
downstream victims right and the

314
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,579
adversary is often going to be able to

315
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,060
maintain right um persistence right and

316
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,880
excess right and and Achieve access to

317
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,640
you know all the downstream right

318
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,440
victims right at any one point in time

319
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,779
right so this is the you know I hope

320
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,940
this this simple graphic right has

321
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,620
demonstrated right the the kind of like

322
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,260
the inherent difficulty right that today

323
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,180
the community struggles with right

324
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,880
defending against supply chain attacks

325
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,399
so now let's look at how supply chain

326
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,740
you know Supply chains compromises have

327
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,040
evolved right over time right and

328
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,360
you know when we look at kind of like

329
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,459
the history of suppression compromises

330
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,800
right kind of like how what we know of

331
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,899
supply chain compromises as it stands in

332
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,420
the present definition kind of started

333
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,220
right in the early 2000s and of course

334
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,260
is ongoing up to this point in time

335
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,720
right uh initially supply chain

336
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,120
compromises took the form of you know

337
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,459
targeting uh commonly known

338
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,079
vulnerabilities right that were

339
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,160
basically left unpatched by

340
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,500
organizations right because as many of

341
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,380
us here today can attest to right

342
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,720
um unfortunately even when you know

343
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,300
vulnerabilities are just not going to be

344
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,980
timely patched by organizations of the

345
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,260
day right for both you know valid

346
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,480
reasons right such as you know having to

347
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,940
to keep up with availability right

348
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,680
system availability in the particular

349
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,019
environment or you know or in

350
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,640
unfortunate situations where you just

351
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,320
have poor cyber hygiene or the lack

352
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,740
thereof of a effective vulnerability

353
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,880
prioritization and management processes

354
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,160
but regardless right

355
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,200
but many vulnerabilities are left and

356
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,240
Patch even when they are known right and

357
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,740
adversaries know this right and they

358
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,120
effectively exploit these

359
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,680
vulnerabilities right to achieve access

360
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,019
right into like their victim

361
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,339
organization

362
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,980
but but over time right especially in

363
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,260
the last decade also we have seen now

364
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,600
adversaries give gaining you know kind

365
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,880
of like getting on the front foot right

366
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,339
of targeting organizations so instead of

367
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,139
waiting for vulnerability disclosures

368
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,899
right they proactively you know inject

369
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,540
malicious code right into some of the

370
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,279
products that are widely used right

371
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,079
across the supply chain right of course

372
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,660
with the notion of hoping to achieve a

373
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,339
successful supply chain compromise right

374
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,760
so they proactively target right uh like

375
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,180
products that are used very you know why

376
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,440
products that are very widely

377
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,540
proliferated and if they're successful

378
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,300
right they will achieve right a

379
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,160
successful right

380
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,639
um uh supply chain compromise right and

381
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,800
not only this they have been a lot

382
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,360
already have they been doing this right

383
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,760
well they have been doing this actively

384
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,579
across like both commercial and open

385
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,860
source products right because they they

386
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,540
know for a fact that as long as they are

387
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,220
going to be able to get their way into

388
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,920
either a commercial or open source

389
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,899
product that is actively proliferated

390
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,760
across the supply chain today right

391
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,800
they're going to be able to achieve

392
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,760
right substantive right access right to

393
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,560
to the downstream like victim

394
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,320
organizations that make use of this uh

395
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,180
product whether they are commercial or

396
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,160
open source

397
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,980
right so as I mentioned earlier right

398
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,860
now that we have kind of given a sense

399
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,440
of you know have a sense of how

400
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,019
a supply chain compromise like typically

401
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,940
takes place and why supply chain

402
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,560
compromises are so difficult to detect

403
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,720
right let's let's you know put things

404
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,079
into context right and speak to in a

405
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,959
particular example right of an actual

406
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,260
like prolific supply chain uh incident

407
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,940
suppression compromise incident right

408
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,459
and at Cloud strike we actually we know

409
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,980
this you know we we track this activity

410
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,100
cluster right uh Estella particle right

411
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,620
uh and it's none other than actually the

412
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,500
incident that targeted the solar winds

413
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,300
uh yeah the solarwinds incident

414
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,360
basically right and as many of you I

415
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,180
believe would be aware of this incident

416
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,040
and of course for those who are not as

417
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,959
particularly familiar so allow me to

418
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,120
quickly provide a quick overview of what

419
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,740
happened right so

420
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,560
basically December of 2020 and there

421
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,360
were there were multiple reports right

422
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,579
of a sophisticated suppression attack

423
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,860
right uh targeting this company known as

424
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,139
solar winds right and solar winds is a

425
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,940
I.T monitoring and management software

426
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,440
company right so it's like a it

427
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,779
infrastructure right uh like you know

428
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,339
management software type of company

429
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,019
right and

430
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,060
it was then

431
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,339
um announced it was then disclosed right

432
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,980
that on in December of 2020 right there

433
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,019
was a supply chain attack right that

434
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,540
happened between uh March of June of

435
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,820
that year right and

436
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,740
you know what it was what was reported

437
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,019
right was that you know a lot many of

438
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,959
the the organizations that employed

439
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,760
solar winds in that environment right

440
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,100
was affected right close to potentially

441
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,160
18 000 organizations were affected right

442
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,980
and you know of note right of this 18

443
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,380
000 or so organizations right there were

444
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,779
multiple sensitive government entities

445
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,940
in the U.S government that was targeted

446
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,040
right uh you know some of the ones that

447
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,480
I've listed on this slide right treasury

448
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,940
Commerce and even the national Telco and

449
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,740
Information Administration which is the

450
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,260
agency that's responsible for the Telco

451
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,560
regulation in the U.S right and

452
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,779
at a point in time upon the disclosure

453
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,480
right there was indication right that it

454
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,519
was us the adversary that's behind this

455
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,500
attack right was a very sophisticated

456
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,199
one because of the multiple like custom

457
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,240
tooling that was being used right and

458
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,279
many of the ttps that were demonstrated

459
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,259
in the attack right were very Advanced

460
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,199
and sophisticated right so in the spirit

461
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,699
of you know

462
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,279
the fact that you know this this has

463
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,440
already happened right uh you know a

464
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,660
while ago now right and and you know

465
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,880
this is an example of a sophisticated

466
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
like supply chain compromise now let's

467
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,059
look at exactly right how sophisticated

468
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,599
right this compromise was right so I'm

469
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,220
gonna this is the part of the

470
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,480
composition where it's going to get a

471
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,400
bit technical for the next few moments

472
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,319
but just bear with me because this is

473
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,179
really intended right at explaining

474
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,939
right how sophisticated like this attack

475
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,199
was

476
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,160
so you know and it's very core right the

477
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,840
Stellar particle Q chain right or the

478
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,600
solar winds uh incident right involved

479
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,179
Right started with a build environment

480
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,580
compromise right there is use that and

481
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,160
and this speed environment compromise is

482
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,080
facilitated by this malware that's track

483
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,240
and crowdstrike known as Sunspot right

484
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,340
Sunspot is the malware that is

485
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,320
eventually used to insert the Sunburst

486
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,840
back door uh into the actual abuse fight

487
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,660
of the solar winds Orion I.T management

488
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,880
product so I will talk about sunbursts

489
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,860
very shortly but let's talk about

490
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,039
Sunspot for a moment right so Sunspot

491
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,559
right it's the it's the malware that

492
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,120
actually exploits right the build

493
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
environment through source code

494
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,660
replacement right it is

495
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,940
it actually monitors right the running

496
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,760
processes on the build service right and

497
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
it detects right when Orion is being

498
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,260
compiled right and actually quickly

499
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,419
replaces one of the source files right

500
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,100
to actually include the Sunburst

501
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,160
backdoor code right and and actually and

502
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,919
also includes an execution path right to

503
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,720
reach it right before restoring the

504
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,720
original source code right and just to

505
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,760
demonstrate how sophisticated Sunspot

506
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,100
was right there were several safeguards

507
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,140
right that were added to Sunspot right

508
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,720
to prevent the tempering process from

509
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,940
you know causing the actually the actual

510
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,980
Orion build to fail right because if

511
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,600
that were to happen it would actually

512
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,820
tip off right the developers of Orion

513
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,160
right to the adversary's presence

514
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,740
right so first Sunspot was used in the Q

515
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,059
chain right to achieve their build

516
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,580
environment and compromise

517
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,620
and then thereafter right like I

518
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,200
mentioned earlier you know Sunspot is

519
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,900
you know to facilitate the insertion of

520
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,520
sunbursts right which is the back door

521
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,860
right and Sunburst is actually you know

522
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,740
distributed within a legitimate software

523
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,559
update associated with Orion right and

524
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,679
this was first observed right uh in the

525
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
in late March 2020 right and the

526
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,900
malicious code uh that was associated

527
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,760
with sunburst is actually distributed as

528
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,980
an inline modification right to an

529
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,840
otherwise legitimate software update

530
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,640
right that was signed using the

531
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,419
developers very own digital certificate

532
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,100
right and

533
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,919
you know by the time that the disclosure

534
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,380
was made in December of 2020 right that

535
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,940
we there was already you know

536
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,559
conclusions right there was conclusive

537
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,260
findings right that that that basically

538
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,020
you know shared with the community that

539
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,580
there was nefarious actions or

540
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,380
objectives that were taken that were

541
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,000
taking place right in the solarwinds

542
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,980
environment for at least eight months to

543
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,840
almost a year

544
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,020
right and Sunburst right as a backdoor

545
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,179
demonstrated very strong operational

546
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,700
security like measures in place right it

547
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,580
included several detection uh evasion

548
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,380
techniques right because such as you

549
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,520
know to delay the start of level

550
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,220
Communications right to evade

551
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,840
um you know existing security tools and

552
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,700
products as being used in the solarwinds

553
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,799
environment and there were even attempts

554
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,140
right at disabling some of the existing

555
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,539
security tools that is in use right in

556
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,520
the solarwinds environment

557
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,580
right the the developers of sunbursts

558
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,919
right which is the back door right also

559
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,260
use many naming conventions from the

560
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,299
actual Orion product source code right

561
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,240
to actually disguise the back doors code

562
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
right to appear and resemble right as

563
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,740
you know a legitimate like part of the

564
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,600
code that was actually written right by

565
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,340
the actual solarwinds developers right

566
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,799
to kind of kind of masquerade as the

567
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,360
legitimate code base

568
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,700
right and the backdog communications

569
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,440
that was actually used

570
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,980
by the original C2 protocols right were

571
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,740
were also based on DNS and HTTP

572
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,539
protocols right they're masqueraded as

573
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,480
legitimate like traffic right like you

574
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,520
know and the intention again right is to

575
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,260
you know masquerade as being in the

576
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,900
legitimate context of uh solarwinds

577
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,360
software and Enterprise environments

578
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,340
but all this goes to show right the

579
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,480
diamond you know that that

580
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,400
sophistication right there's also that

581
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,620
was going that gone into you know

582
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,020
building the you know in into developing

583
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,780
the sambus like backdoor

584
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,240
right then with sunburst right the next

585
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,580
stage tooling right which uh includes

586
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,500
right uh you know malware that's tracked

587
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,000
as tear drop and raindrop and crop

588
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,100
strike right were basically used to

589
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,620
facilitate uh lateral movement in the in

590
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,900
in this in the solarwinds uh back in

591
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,880
environment right anywhere and these are

592
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,200
custom loaders that will eventually

593
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,419
install Cobalt strike right to then

594
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,299
carry on right actions on objectives in

595
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,159
their victim environment

596
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,440
and on top of this

597
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,600
um existing instead of this tooling

598
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,700
right there was also additional

599
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,740
proprietary tooling right that were used

600
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,500
uh to achieve long-term persistence

601
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,720
right in the victim environment right uh

602
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,880
you know the the most the most notable

603
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,340
ones are um one of them is known as go

604
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,080
Max right which is tracked as Sun

605
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,020
shuttle at at a crowdstrike right go Max

606
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,360
is actually you can think of go Max as a

607
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,480
secondary backdoor right so

608
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,720
it was sun go Max is delivered right

609
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,299
after after Sunburst is it has achieved

610
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,679
initial access right in the victim

611
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,559
organization right and go Max is really

612
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,260
intended as you know an example of a

613
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,240
long-term persistent backdoor that is

614
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,059
used to maintain right the access in the

615
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,580
victim environment right even in in the

616
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,380
event other of the existing tools I

617
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,760
talked about earlier right like

618
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,039
sunbursts like teardrop and raindrop

619
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,919
right even those are being identified

620
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,600
and removed right during incidence

621
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,360
investigation right go Max is instead is

622
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,419
really in is really developed and

623
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,039
deployed right with the intent to

624
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,260
achieve long-term

625
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,000
um access in the victim environment

626
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,799
right so for example and just to

627
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,659
demonstrate like just to illustrate how

628
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,700
they do that right gomax has actually

629
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,039
intentional delayed activation

630
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,039
functionality that's built into

631
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,320
um the back door right so that so that

632
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,080
it basically stays hidden right until

633
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,419
it's required right for for

634
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,520
you know for Activation right to be used

635
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,740
by a secondary backdoor

636
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,799
right and to you know to facilitate the

637
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,400
success of go Max's ability to achieve

638
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,679
long-term persistence right there was

639
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,799
also a you know a proprietary

640
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,720
um you know internal reconnaissance tool

641
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,100
right that was developed by the

642
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,020
adversaries that is known as go Finder

643
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,419
right and what does go finder does is go

644
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,460
finder is actually used right to

645
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,520
actually access the suitability of an uh

646
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,620
of an internal host a host that besides

647
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,880
from the internal victim environment

648
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,919
right before go Max is actually

649
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,500
installed right so imagine this right

650
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,659
there is not only a secondary backdoor

651
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,520
that's being used there is actually a

652
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,500
proprietary reconnaissance tool that is

653
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,380
being developed by the adversary to look

654
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,559
for suitable like environments right for

655
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,900
the secondary back door right to achieve

656
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,820
right to be deployed and Achieve like

657
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,980
long-term persistence right so I hope

658
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,840
just with this example just to show you

659
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,840
right how sophisticated right this

660
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,720
adversary is and how persistent like

661
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,179
this adversary was hoping to be right in

662
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,799
the victim environment right as part of

663
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,600
this particular incident right then

664
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,799
after

665
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,500
this series of you know proprietary

666
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,179
tooling is being deployed right then

667
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,980
that follows by you know data

668
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,840
exploitation right in large throw side

669
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,000
which is you know that which is to

670
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,760
support right that that Espionage right

671
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,720
um

672
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,179
intent right of the adversary right and

673
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,940
of course that's done you know with HTTP

674
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,340
base right to basically you know be

675
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,200
successful to master successfully

676
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,700
masquerading right a lot of the

677
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,960
information that's being exfiltrated

678
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,940
right out of the respectivity team

679
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,980
environments

680
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,200
right so that so now that we have seen

681
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,260
how sophisticated this attack was right

682
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,780
let's look at you know who the adversary

683
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,900
behind this attack is right and it's

684
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,940
none other than you know this adversary

685
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,580
that crowd strike you know tracks as a

686
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,159
Cozy Bear right if you are familiar with

687
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,200
the history of

688
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,919
um

689
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,020
you know the Russian adversary the

690
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,120
Russian adversaries of the day or if you

691
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,980
are familiar also with

692
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,000
um

693
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,400
you know the the recent history of cyber

694
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,080
attacks right you will know that Cozy

695
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,820
Bear is also one of the adversaries that

696
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,039
was uh involved right in the very

697
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,919
prolific attack right in the U.S

698
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,900
elections the U.S presidential elections

699
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,240
in 2016 right they're basically in the

700
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,580
lead up uh to the to the Trump and

701
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,220
Clinton elections right uh Cozy Bear

702
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,440
alongside fancy Bear right were the two

703
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,179
adversaries that were responsible for

704
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,080
you know many if not most of the you

705
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,240
know um malicious cyber activity and

706
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,559
disinformation operations right

707
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,779
associated with the 2016 U.S

708
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,659
presidential elections right so

709
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,059
in a somewhat similar and consistent

710
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,919
fashion right

711
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,840
the adversary that's behind the solar

712
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,880
wind bridge is none other than the yeah

713
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,159
it's none other than Cozy Bear right

714
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,919
it's every there's been identified to be

715
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,260
active since 2011 and continues to be

716
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,640
active today so they have been around

717
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,120
for more than 10 years now right and

718
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,120
um this adversary is is you know it does

719
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,980
what it does right for the for for the

720
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,020
purpose of political Espionage right and

721
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,480
it's really been attributed right to be

722
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,640
an entity that is acting on behalf of

723
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,799
the Russian uh foreign intelligence

724
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,380
service or the svr right he has

725
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,299
demonstrated on multiple accounts right

726
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,580
beyond the solarwinds bridge right that

727
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,500
he has demonstrated right a very high

728
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,020
level of sophistication right and also a

729
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,020
a a great deal of you know a very a

730
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,520
persistent kind of like a consistent

731
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,380
um objective of achieving persistence

732
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,580
right in the environment that they

733
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,880
target right and actually of late right

734
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,279
of recent times right we have seen it

735
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,380
almost starting to demonstrate a certain

736
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,640
level of

737
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,159
um specialization in that it focuses on

738
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:18,240
like

739
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,779
you know sub like them employing large

740
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,820
volumes of spearfishing campaigns right

741
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,340
uh we use it to deliver a wide range of

742
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,960
malware right so there is a working

743
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,380
hypothesis that increasingly so there is

744
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,020
a there is a potential uh trajectory

745
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,900
where this Russian adversaries are

746
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,080
developing specializations uh in their

747
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
in in the in the functions that they

748
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,320
offer to their compact rates right in

749
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,360
the in in the in the in the ecosystem

750
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,760
such that you know maybe in in the way

751
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,460
forward right we may see uh not so long

752
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,679
for now where Cozy Bear would specialize

753
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,440
right in or in offering in specializing

754
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,679
in achieving initial access right for

755
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,140
perhaps another another

756
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,640
adversary another band maybe fancy bear

757
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,980
maybe primitive bear maybe venomous

758
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,440
venomous Bear right to then be

759
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,480
responsible for the follow-on actions

760
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,460
right in the victim environment right of

761
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,679
course time will tell but because we can

762
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,539
we can be sure that cozy Bears can going

763
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,100
to be adversary that's here to stay

764
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,200
right which is why I hope that you know

765
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,480
the community at large right should be

766
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
at least aware of what Cozy Bear does

767
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,980
and you know be and have Cozy Bear it's

768
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,320
top of mind right as you think about you

769
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,640
know understanding the adversaries of

770
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,559
the day

771
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,960
so now that we have seen

772
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,880
you know what this prolific adversary

773
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,620
and these prolific attack is all about

774
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,340
let's look at

775
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,220
let's kind of enlarge like the expand

776
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,380
the conversation and look at again right

777
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,200
broadly how supply chain attacks right

778
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,059
typically can happen right to an

779
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,100
organization right and

780
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,960
broadly speaking

781
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,559
um

782
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,020
there are these three ways right in

783
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,700
which supply chain attacks typically

784
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,919
happen right they either typically take

785
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,860
place via a software's a compromise a

786
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,659
software supply chain compromise right

787
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,480
which is in my opinion uh the most

788
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,460
prevalent way in which supply chain

789
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,919
attacks happen today and and given how

790
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,720
you know basically software has taken

791
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,399
over the world right it's increasingly

792
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,559
so going to be the primary way in which

793
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,820
the budget attacks are going to happen

794
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,679
right but of course there's also

795
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,220
Hardware uh you know supply chain uh

796
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,960
compromises right they can take place

797
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,140
right that involves the physical

798
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,220
tempering or modification of Hardware

799
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,559
components that can achieve a compromise

800
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,899
right uh of of a physical Hardware

801
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,600
component right and of course as we have

802
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,640
seen earlier with the solar winds

803
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,380
example right

804
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,480
another key way in which subtraction

805
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,240
attacks happen is in exploiting right

806
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,539
the inherent like trust right that um

807
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,240
that that organizations organizations

808
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,340
have right in their suppliers and India

809
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,159
vendors and partners today right so

810
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,779
let's now unpack right the different

811
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,580
ways in which supply chain attacks can

812
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,860
happen right of course we have seen

813
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,440
earlier right uh the solarwinds example

814
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,039
would be a prime example of a software

815
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,380
supply chain compromise right but again

816
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,500
just to extend the composition for to to

817
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,179
have a holistic discussion around this

818
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,580
particular topic right let's look at

819
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,620
some of the common methods right in

820
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,720
which you know supply chain software

821
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,460
compromise software suppression

822
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,200
compromises typically take place right

823
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,760
there are basically these four common

824
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,520
methods right in which a software supply

825
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,279
chain compromise is achieved right first

826
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,140
there is a

827
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,179
the exploitation of software design

828
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,220
flaws right

829
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,080
um there's one key way in which like

830
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,640
software supply chain comprises can be

831
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,399
achieved right next it the next way is

832
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,500
incorporating a vulnerable third-party

833
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,480
component into a software product right

834
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,399
so this of this vulnerable third-party

835
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,320
component uh you know could be a

836
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,380
vulnerable open source uh software right

837
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,299
that is incorporated into a commercial

838
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,159
product right for commercial use right

839
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,200
that could be one example right then

840
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,059
another way in which a software

841
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,860
suppression compromise can be achieved

842
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,440
right is to infiltrate right a suppliers

843
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,720
Network right with malicious code right

844
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,399
prior to the final software product

845
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,020
being delivered compiled and delivered

846
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,080
right so an example of this example of

847
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,059
this category will be none other than

848
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,559
the solarwinds example that I talked

849
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,960
about earlier right with some Sport with

850
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,779
sunbursts and so and so forth right and

851
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,940
last but not least um there is also

852
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,340
another way in another another inroad

853
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,720
right into achieving a software supply

854
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,760
chain compromise which is to inject

855
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,100
malicious code right

856
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,860
into a software before right before it's

857
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,299
being deployed right by the customer

858
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,340
right so this is kind of like almost

859
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,320
like men in the middle ring like a man

860
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,059
in the middle type of compromise right

861
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,360
that that that targets like uh the the

862
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,120
soft specific software right before it's

863
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,760
being used in production right by a

864
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,620
customer

865
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,020
right and when we look at this different

866
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,580
genres of software supply chain

867
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,679
compromises right let's look at one

868
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,720
particular adversary right that is you

869
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,600
know particularly prolific right on on

870
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,279
the software supply chain compromises

871
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,740
and it's done other than you know this

872
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,240
particular adversary known as wicked

873
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,520
Panda right and if again you are

874
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,899
familiar with

875
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,760
um you know the the recent history of

876
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
cyber security and if you are

877
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
particularly familiar with

878
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,220
um the the Chinese adversaries or the

879
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,380
China based and the service right you

880
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,240
must you would have known about Wicked

881
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,100
Panda right you may know as you may

882
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,340
known you may know Wicked Panda as

883
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,080
apt-41 you may know Wicked Panda as

884
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,120
windy group right they all refer to the

885
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,340
same adversary right this adversary is

886
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,220
one of the most prolific and enduring

887
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,260
right Chinese space adversaries right as

888
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,419
you can see here almost similar to Cozy

889
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,159
Bear right they have been in operation

890
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,799
right for for large for large part of

891
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,080
the past decade and Beyond

892
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,919
um

893
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,960
they are interesting adversary because

894
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,360
they were adversary that you know when

895
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,320
we first

896
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,240
track you know that activity in the

897
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,100
world right most of the activity were

898
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,620
focused on you know and operations that

899
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,179
you were typically associated with

900
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,159
e-crime right or financially motivated

901
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,039
operations right but over time right the

902
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,399
DF evolved right to to operations that

903
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,039
are more aligned with a state-sponsored

904
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,480
type intrusions right there's more

905
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,980
focused on

906
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,200
um political and like industrial

907
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Espionage right and uh and that's also

908
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,779
how you know after a a prolonged period

909
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,820
of tracking this adversary right we have

910
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,159
also been able to effectively you know

911
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,080
identify an attribute that this is a

912
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,179
group of adversaries that's actually you

913
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:43,320
know there are actually a bunch of

914
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,260
contractors that's working on behalf of

915
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,779
the ministry of State security uh in

916
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,580
China right which is the ministry of

917
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,799
State security is the foreign

918
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,659
intelligence agency of the Chinese

919
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,640
government right so we have already you

920
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,440
know identified that this is actually

921
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,720
Wicked panda is actually a conglomerate

922
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,360
right of uh private sector contractors

923
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,700
there's basically on behalf of the state

924
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,399
right and this adversary is

925
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,440
an adversary that's demonstrated a very

926
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,139
long history of of software supply chain

927
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,418
compromises right to achieve both right

928
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,359
to doing so right to achieve both

929
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,520
financial gain right so financial gain

930
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,320
for themselves right and also for

931
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,080
Espionage like purposes right and they

932
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,760
are also one of the adversaries that

933
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,639
were known to have effectively you know

934
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,679
and rapidly identified and exploited

935
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,500
like log 4G right when he was first uh

936
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,060
when he first came to like like December

937
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,859
or last year right and it's adversary

938
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,139
day you know relies heavily on Cobalt

939
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,580
strike but it's also known to use many

940
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,859
of the proprietary tooling right that is

941
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,899
often associated with the Chinese Nexus

942
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,000
the China Nexus adversaries

943
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,379
right and

944
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,659
just to show you just to speak to how

945
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,580
prolific right the track is the track

946
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,580
record right of this adversary is when

947
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,140
it comes to supply chain compromises

948
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,820
right you can see right for a good

949
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,400
amount of of time right since the

950
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,040
mid-2010s right up to up to up to today

951
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,800
right there is a series right of

952
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,720
prolific right so by software supply

953
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,980
chain compromises right that's

954
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,839
associated right with this particular

955
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,880
adversary right and of course it's going

956
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,680
to be beyond the scope of today's

957
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,480
discussion right to go into each and

958
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,400
every one of this incident but you know

959
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,619
I've kind of stated this incidence uh

960
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,480
these instances of software supply chain

961
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,940
compromises associated with panda for

962
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,560
the audience here today so if you are

963
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,060
interested to find out more you know you

964
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,160
can just look them up right and there's

965
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,500
this all these different incidents right

966
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,900
are very widely covered right by the

967
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,359
security Community around right how we

968
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,460
get Panda right has effectively achieved

969
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,980
a software so touching compromises right

970
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,300
in this

971
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,180
particular instances right and and

972
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,460
interestingly ever since 2018 right

973
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,040
there hasn't actually been a publicly

974
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,660
disclosed uh instance of a a software

975
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,280
supply chain compromise Associated

976
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,200
Wicked Panda but at the same time we

977
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,720
have observed right four instances right

978
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,940
of you know software supply chain

979
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,460
compromises involved right in software

980
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,980
that's actually required uh to be

981
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,560
installed by cities citizens in China

982
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,900
right and you know there is this working

983
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,760
hypothesis that perhaps we get Panda

984
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,520
right has you know used the earlier

985
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,740
years of their of their their earlier

986
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,540
Forest into supply chain compromises

987
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,460
right to kind of test their capability

988
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,099
and and prove their capability and now

989
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,560
right this capability is being used

990
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,780
right internally within China right for

991
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,880
domestic surveillance capabilities

992
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,460
right of course again right time would

993
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,980
tell right as more becomes uh known

994
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,560
right we will see you know what

995
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,780
would be but what we will but we will

996
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,099
know more about how this supply chain

997
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,960
capability selection complex capability

998
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,540
has evolved over time

999
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,400
right and

1000
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,260
you know I've talked I've just alluded

1001
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,300
to it just a couple of moments ago right

1002
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,640
about about Wicked Panda but I think a

1003
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,680
key incident that I wanted to you know

1004
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,420
spend a few moments talking about right

1005
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,240
with this with this audience today is is

1006
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,700
basically the very prolific log 4G and

1007
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,980
log4 shell incident right that happened

1008
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,920
uh that that happened right at the close

1009
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,260
of the previous year right um the reason

1010
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,460
why I want to bring this up in this

1011
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,200
particular context is because you know

1012
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,420
everyone is

1013
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,760
is almost everyone in the community is

1014
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,260
very aware very well aware of what

1015
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,060
happened with lock 4G lock for Shell but

1016
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,640
I think not many in the community would

1017
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,619
typically associate right this

1018
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,440
particular incident right to a software

1019
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,820
change a software supply chain

1020
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,680
compromise right and actually in my

1021
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,859
opinion right I I do believe that this

1022
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,619
is this like the Lord for Shell uh

1023
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,660
incident should be part of the supply

1024
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,420
chain compromise composition because it

1025
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,760
is you know in my opinion right a clear

1026
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,220
example right of how a widely

1027
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,920
proliferated open source

1028
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,520
um

1029
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,280
you know software is being is is

1030
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,859
vulnerable and was exploited and it was

1031
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,320
used to achieve right

1032
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,540
um you know that similar Downstream

1033
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,940
access right there's often right

1034
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,400
associated with a successful supply

1035
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,920
chain compromise right and it's in their

1036
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,320
spirit that you know I I I want to you

1037
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,540
know bring this to everyone's attention

1038
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,760
right to think about you know instances

1039
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,680
of log 4G lock for shell and other

1040
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,920
instances of other similar instances of

1041
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,200
you know open source you know products

1042
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,839
right being exploited right as you know

1043
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,420
indication right or as forming as part

1044
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,619
of this supply chain compromise

1045
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,119
composition that we all should be having

1046
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,220
right in the security Community today

1047
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,380
right and because

1048
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,359
I believe most of us are familiar with

1049
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,920
this incident I'm not going to be

1050
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,359
labeled the point to talk about what

1051
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,099
happened I'm just going to assume that

1052
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,020
you know everyone most of us here are

1053
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,359
familiar with what happened right and

1054
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,040
again just to

1055
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,619
demonstrate right how

1056
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:57,599
you know the kind of like the the

1057
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,900
prolific impact right of a of a of a

1058
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,420
surface affection compromise right and

1059
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,780
that involves like a prolific uh you

1060
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,400
know open source you know product that's

1061
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,920
being used in many uh commercial and

1062
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,839
open source products today right is to

1063
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,119
look at the timeline of of the of the

1064
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,040
event of the insecurity incidents right

1065
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,200
associated with log4j lock washer right

1066
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,599
as we can see here right after the

1067
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,560
disclosure right of uh the after the

1068
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,940
public disclosure of the vulnerability

1069
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,940
right there was basically a succession a

1070
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,760
quick succession right off of that of

1071
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,740
the vulnerability being exploited right

1072
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,020
first by e-crime adversaries right you

1073
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,180
can see XM rigged by mastic botnets

1074
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,760
right um you know being exploited uh

1075
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,160
exploiting uh this vulnerability right

1076
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,079
and and proliferating it for their

1077
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,300
e-client purposes right XM brick is a

1078
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,160
it's a it's a it's a malware that's

1079
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,900
often associated with crypto mining

1080
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,300
right Master is a it's a broad net it's

1081
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,119
a it's a prolific botnet malware that is

1082
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,800
being used to deploy

1083
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
um you know your commodity information

1084
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,520
Steelers many of your banking Trojans of

1085
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,680
the day right then thereafter right you

1086
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,000
will see you as you can see on this

1087
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,359
timeline line right we saw a series of

1088
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:10,380
state-sponsored related adversaries

1089
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,880
right state sponsored adversaries

1090
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,800
exploiting the vulnerability right with

1091
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,900
Nemesis kitten with aquatic Panda right

1092
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,420
then after that we also then again saw a

1093
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,640
series of you know your big game hunting

1094
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,619
uh ransomware adversaries such as double

1095
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,480
spider and you know a prolific access

1096
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,520
broker known as profit spider right

1097
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,859
exploiting this adversary this this

1098
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,780
vulnerability right for their intended

1099
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,880
purposes right and of course as many of

1100
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,920
you would be well aware of right this

1101
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,619
activity continued very much into this

1102
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:38,820
year

1103
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,220
right and of this and the service that

1104
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,140
we have seen exploiting uh this

1105
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,820
particular vulnerability I just wanted

1106
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,980
to point you know the community's

1107
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,660
attention to this particular adversary

1108
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,960
right um because uh this MSM is no none

1109
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,119
other than aquatic Panda right this Ms

1110
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,099
semi there is some value to spend some

1111
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,300
time to talk about this particular

1112
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,240
adversary because this adversary uh we

1113
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,760
it's it's one of the recently attributed

1114
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,160
china-based adversaries that continues

1115
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,839
to be very prolific right over the

1116
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,320
course of the last right you know

1117
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,820
who also years that he's been active

1118
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,640
right it's an adversary that performs

1119
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,680
both traditional intelligence collection

1120
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,040
and Industrial Espionage right um for on

1121
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,599
behalf of the Chinese government right

1122
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,400
this is uh this is what is known as a

1123
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,020
dual Mission adversary and this is

1124
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,300
actually a very common team uh across

1125
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,640
multiple uh china-based adversaries

1126
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,839
right so we see many Chinese

1127
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,940
chinese-based adversaries performing a

1128
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,200
combination of both intelligence

1129
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,820
collection and Industrial Espionage

1130
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,859
right and this adversary

1131
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:38,460
um

1132
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,099
is particularly active across Asia right

1133
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,980
is you know it's targeted multiple uh

1134
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,380
multiple sectors and sectors that are

1135
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,720
typically associated with the ends of

1136
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,099
intelligence collection and Industrial

1137
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,260
Espionage right as you can see here is

1138
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,000
targeted close to a hundred

1139
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,940
organizations in 17 countries right over

1140
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,160
the course of 2021 and many of these 17

1141
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,320
countries or the vast majority of the 17

1142
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,660
countries actually are countries that

1143
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,599
reside in Asia right and similar to you

1144
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,980
know what we have seen replica Panda

1145
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,780
right this is the adversary that relies

1146
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,880
heavily on Cobalt strike and it's also

1147
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,380
known to

1148
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,099
you know deliver many of the proprietary

1149
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,900
malware that is typically Associated

1150
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,420
right with the a china-based right a

1151
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,460
chinese-based adversary and also

1152
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,920
similarly to Wicked tender right the

1153
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,900
carbon assessment is that this adversary

1154
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,780
aquatic panda is also right a contractor

1155
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,359
right that is basically hacking on

1156
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,160
behalf right of the ministry of State

1157
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,500
security right for both you know

1158
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,780
geopolitical like you know purposes

1159
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,760
geopolitical intelligence and also for

1160
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,619
economic development purposes right

1161
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,900
which is a function of industrial

1162
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,420
Espionage right basically stealing right

1163
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,880
proprietary economic information right

1164
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,400
that can then spur domestic Innovation

1165
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,740
right within China

1166
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,720
right so now that we have spoken at

1167
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,220
Great length about

1168
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,119
um

1169
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,280
software supply chain threats right

1170
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,500
let's spend a just a quick moment to

1171
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,300
look at what hardware supply chain

1172
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,920
attacks look like right and hardware

1173
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,140
supply chain attacks uh you know they

1174
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,940
are a lot harder right to achieve

1175
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,400
because they actually require uh you

1176
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,040
know uh in my opinion right a greater

1177
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,900
view of human intelligence assets being

1178
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,940
actually deployed in the field right to

1179
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,920
achieve Hardware suppression attacks but

1180
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,740
the the by no means is it by no means

1181
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,760
I'm not saying that they are not

1182
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,560
happening they are definitely happening

1183
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,720
as we speak but of course you know given

1184
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,180
the the complexity that that involves

1185
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,160
right deploying human intelligence

1186
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,920
assets in in actual in in actual

1187
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,480
physical as part of the physical Supply

1188
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,400
chains right they are just by virtue a

1189
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,560
lot harder to achieve right if you think

1190
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,960
about it from uh intelligence agency

1191
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,060
perspective right and

1192
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,460
and really the the there are two key

1193
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,200
ways that this typically happens right

1194
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,960
one is through physical tampering so

1195
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,940
like physically modifying right a

1196
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,819
physical component right uh you know as

1197
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:01,560
part of the manufacturing process right

1198
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,240
so like if you think about some of the

1199
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,319
uh early examples of of cyber attacks or

1200
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,540
or electronic warfare attacks right the

1201
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,819
notion of you know installing like logic

1202
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,099
bombs right like logic bombs into

1203
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:17,460
physical like in like physical parts

1204
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,560
right like how I I believe there was

1205
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,420
this example of a logic bombing

1206
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,579
installed right in the physical like

1207
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,980
commercial printer that was being I

1208
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,500
think used in in I think Iran or even I

1209
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,540
can't remember but there was useful that

1210
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,540
there was use in the early uh in in I

1211
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,460
think the first Gulf War right as an

1212
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,140
early example of electric electronic

1213
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,200
warfare right that's a a very simple

1214
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,960
like you know easy to understand example

1215
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,119
of a hardware supply chain attack right

1216
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,980
that involves tampering right then the

1217
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,260
other common way in visual hardware

1218
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,940
supply chain attack is being achieved is

1219
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,339
through using counterfeits right to

1220
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:54,960
replace the legitimate Hardware right we

1221
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,119
counterfeit once that of course uh

1222
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,740
involves some kind of compromise that

1223
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,040
allows right that Downstream access that

1224
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,599
or some kind of uh

1225
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,640
the kind of objective right that comes

1226
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,500
with that counterfeit being deployed in

1227
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,020
that physical infrastructure

1228
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,880
right then of course

1229
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,240
there is the you know the the genre of

1230
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,099
suppression attacks right that exploits

1231
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:22,619
like uh trusted relationships right and

1232
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,900
again if you are somewhat familiar with

1233
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,280
the history of supply chain attacks

1234
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,020
right the the most

1235
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,599
um prolific example that everyone talks

1236
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,520
about when he thinks about you know the

1237
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,400
the suppression attack being being a

1238
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,140
function of exploiting

1239
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,640
um a trusted relationship right it's

1240
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,260
none other than operational card Hopper

1241
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,780
right this was a multi-year

1242
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,420
um cyber Espionage capable Espionage

1243
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,220
campaign

1244
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,119
um there must be they have been

1245
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,980
attributed to the chinese-based

1246
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,599
adversaries right they're basically

1247
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,319
targeted a a good a good number of I.T

1248
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,240
service providers right that was really

1249
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,180
intended at exploiting right not

1250
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,700
them right not access not not direct

1251
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,560
access into these service providers but

1252
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,200
rather it's through this I.T service

1253
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,480
providers right to act to achieve access

1254
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,140
right into right the data that was uh

1255
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,300
that of their customer organizations

1256
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,880
right and you can see here I just listed

1257
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,220
you know just a number a handful of the

1258
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,440
victims that were affected by this a

1259
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,140
very prolific uh campaign uh you know

1260
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,240
many of them should should be familiar

1261
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,099
right to the to the to the audience here

1262
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:32,280
today right and over a period of at

1263
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,980
least six if not eight years right six

1264
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,079
to eight years there were you know uh

1265
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:38,339
large quantities of intellectual

1266
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:40,020
property that was stolen from this

1267
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,720
organizations right that were then you

1268
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,060
know basically funneled back right to to

1269
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,520
China right because the the you know for

1270
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,900
the simple fact that the chinese-based

1271
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,359
adversaries are the ones behind uh this

1272
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,420
uh particular multi-year campaign right

1273
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,780
and similarly this is a a campaign that

1274
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,119
is very uh well covered right English

1275
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,400
future today so if there is further

1276
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,839
interest right in the audience to find

1277
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,700
out more about this genre of supply

1278
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,680
chain attacks right please feel free to

1279
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,000
look up right on this particular

1280
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,740
campaign on the internet you'll find a

1281
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,900
lot of content around this particular

1282
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,680
example of a suppression compromise

1283
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,720
right and of course let's spend a few

1284
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,339
moments then looking at a more recent

1285
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,380
example right of a supply chain

1286
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,119
compromise right that that leverages

1287
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,760
this notion of uh abuse of a trusted

1288
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,560
relationship right and it's done other

1289
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,900
than the incident right that targeted

1290
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,839
right this company known as caseya and I

1291
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,060
believe again many of the members of

1292
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,980
this audience today would be a familiar

1293
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,720
with this particular incident but what

1294
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,400
happened here right was you know

1295
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,280
basically a a watershed moment right in

1296
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,020
the security Community because this is

1297
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,240
really I think for the very first time

1298
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,400
in known history right in known cyber

1299
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,619
security history where we actually saw

1300
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,800
an e-crime adversary actually targeting

1301
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,260
but basically performing the equivalent

1302
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,359
of a supply chain compromise right to

1303
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:03,839
scale the impact right of a ransomware

1304
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,000
attack right the reason why this is a

1305
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,040
watershed moment is because oftentimes

1306
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,839
we associate right supply chain

1307
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,520
compromises with state-sponsored

1308
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,440
adversaries as we have seen right in all

1309
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,119
the early examples right both in the

1310
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,500
Russians and with the Chinese but this

1311
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,720
is for the very first time we see

1312
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,780
e-crime adversary right leveraging you

1313
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,160
know basically demonstrating the level

1314
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,619
of sophistication to achieve right a

1315
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,660
supply chain compromise right to scale

1316
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,240
the impact of a ransomware attack right

1317
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,680
and

1318
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,440
you know for those of you who are uh who

1319
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,700
are familiar with this particular

1320
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,500
incident right you would know that this

1321
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,780
is the adversary that was behind that

1322
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,880
particular uh attack and it's none other

1323
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,680
than this ever semi that's tracked and

1324
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,060
attributed as pinches by that

1325
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,119
crowdstrike it is also known as the r

1326
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,520
the ever semi behind the are evil or the

1327
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,700
revo or the soleno kibi ransomware right

1328
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,160
and at the group's pick right this at

1329
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,319
ransomware was one of the most popular

1330
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,560
ransomware service providers right we

1331
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,780
know when it was very active back in the

1332
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,359
back back in 2020 back in the time of

1333
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:10,859
2020 to 2021 right time period it was

1334
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,319
probably the most prolific adverse uh

1335
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:15,720
big game hunting ransomware uh alongside

1336
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,400
Conti right these two were probably

1337
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,440
right Henry go hand in hand as one of

1338
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,900
the the two most prolific uh ransomware

1339
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,300
families during the 2020 to 2021 period

1340
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,839
right and of course uh in late 2021 we

1341
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,760
saw this particular adversary you know

1342
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,440
being subjected to a series of law

1343
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,000
enforcement action that was directed at

1344
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,619
the group and then actually that

1345
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,980
resulted in kind of the group uh

1346
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,619
the group's activity getting like very

1347
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,780
relatively muted right because many of

1348
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,880
the members were arrested right so that

1349
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,099
basically fundamentally undermined right

1350
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:48,839
the adversary's ability to continue to

1351
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,119
operate effectively but interestingly

1352
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,119
right as recent as May of this year we

1353
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,819
you know we many of us have assumed that

1354
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:58,680
the river ransomware is already done and

1355
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,380
out but we actually saw new samples of

1356
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,359
river being compiled and and actually

1357
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,480
being uh you being found in the wild

1358
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,359
right which and these samples right were

1359
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,339
demonstrated that whoever compiled it

1360
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:12,900
right has full access to the source code

1361
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,060
right so what this means is that you

1362
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,180
know perhaps some some some remaining

1363
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,319
group members right have already

1364
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:22,440
sprinted off and from the group right or

1365
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,079
at least the ones that were were they

1366
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,000
are still managed to roam free right

1367
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,460
from law enforcement right have started

1368
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,599
to you know

1369
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:33,119
they started to bend it together to

1370
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,740
start thinking about using Revo where

1371
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,119
Aaron somewhere again right as part of

1372
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,980
their attacks right so you know Pinchy

1373
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,780
spider might have gone dormant right for

1374
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,940
large parts of 2022 given the law

1375
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,339
enforcement actions they have taken on

1376
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:46,859
the group right in in in as the year

1377
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:49,020
came to a close last year but we can but

1378
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,180
I think we are safe to assume that this

1379
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,339
group is not down and out right but in

1380
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:55,680
any chunks right so it's again an

1381
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,540
adversary that you know I hope this

1382
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,220
community would continue to be to stay

1383
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,680
on the lookout for

1384
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,900
right and kind of like to conclude right

1385
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,300
the composition today

1386
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,540
I wanted to you know just share with the

1387
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,520
audience here today right just you know

1388
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,680
just two things right like first and

1389
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,559
foremost right where you know I think

1390
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,000
where do I think supply chain

1391
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,980
compromises are bound towards right

1392
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,839
where are we going right when it comes

1393
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,520
to where are we going ahead right when

1394
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,839
it comes to some punching compromises

1395
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,520
and then you know close up to this

1396
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,839
composition with some recommendations

1397
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,819
right that I hope that the audience can

1398
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,319
take away with you today to think about

1399
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:33,480
how you can you know improve right

1400
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,220
supporting Security in your

1401
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,380
organizations today right

1402
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,119
first let's look at you know where

1403
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,619
supply chain compromises are heated

1404
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:41,760
right

1405
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,500
um you know the the too long didn't read

1406
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,300
version of what this slide is supposed

1407
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,579
to basically tell is that you know

1408
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,500
supply chain compromises

1409
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,420
are not going to go away right in fact I

1410
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,440
think they're just going to become

1411
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,260
increasingly uh common right uh for

1412
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,819
these reasons right so first and

1413
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:58,619
foremost right uh you know adversaries

1414
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,119
have demonstrated this Keen ability

1415
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,700
right in being able to rapidly identify

1416
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,800
right and exploit right vulnerabilities

1417
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,720
of the day right as we have seen with

1418
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,819
what happened in lock 4J lock for Shell

1419
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:11,160
we have seen with proxy logon proxy uh

1420
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,020
proxy logon proxy shell right we have

1421
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,520
seen with many of the prolific

1422
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,920
vulnerabilities that were that were that

1423
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,540
were disclosed right off late right we

1424
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,579
have seen this consistent capability

1425
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,920
right with both state sponsored and

1426
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,319
e-com adversaries right right to to be

1427
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:27,420
able to you know quickly identify right

1428
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,480
that that window of opportunity right in

1429
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,280
after post disclosure right to quickly

1430
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,660
weaponize right these vulnerabilities

1431
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,480
and Target right oftentimes in a very

1432
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,099
indiscriminate fashion right any

1433
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:40,500
organization that they can be they can

1434
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,900
effectively uh in fact right they can

1435
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,700
effectively gain access tonight they

1436
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,040
will do that right so

1437
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,140
you know this is this shows no signs of

1438
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,839
stopping right then secondly right as a

1439
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,480
as a as how Global how Supply chains

1440
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,579
have evolved right over time right do

1441
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,619
they suffice to say like you know like

1442
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:01,800
you just look at any any of the the

1443
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,960
products that you currently have in use

1444
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,240
today but whether is it the laptop that

1445
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,400
you are using or your mobile phone or

1446
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,500
many of the products that or many of the

1447
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,000
you know run of the new household

1448
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,859
products that you use today as part of

1449
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:16,020
your day-to-day right many of them right

1450
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,000
or if not all of them right are

1451
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,440
basically assembled right are put

1452
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,540
together right by a very globally or

1453
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,760
dispersed supply chain right what that

1454
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,500
means is that you know at any point in

1455
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,020
time right in that in that in that you

1456
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,059
know in that fabrication and in the

1457
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,460
assembly process right there is an

1458
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,319
opportunity right for a software or

1459
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,300
Hardware compromise right to take place

1460
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,180
right so you know given how dispersed

1461
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,800
the supply chain the dispersed nature of

1462
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,359
today's supply chain right right the

1463
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,059
just the the probability right and the

1464
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:48,059
and the the opportunity right for a

1465
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,500
supply chain compromise right it's just

1466
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,559
so much more like higher right and

1467
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,900
just as what we have seen with

1468
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,660
um the the the the situation we lock 4G

1469
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,760
right and I think yeah and look for

1470
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,380
Shell right and I think in a few months

1471
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,780
a few months ago we also saw this um

1472
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,599
this uh Java spring framework right uh

1473
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:08,339
that was also being compromised right we

1474
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:10,319
have seen increasingly more examples

1475
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,319
right of Open Source right

1476
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:15,240
um products right they are especially

1477
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,559
the ones that are widely proliferated

1478
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,079
right in the community today right they

1479
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:20,940
are being used uh that are widely

1480
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,980
proliferated like these examples of this

1481
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,240
open source

1482
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,940
um products right being exploited right

1483
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,099
being targeted right to achieve right

1484
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,020
that that widespread access right

1485
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,760
because of their because of how

1486
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,680
proliferated they are right in many of

1487
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,940
the commercial and open source products

1488
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,500
that are being in use today right I

1489
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,540
think adversaries have identified this

1490
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,059
as an opportunity right and they will

1491
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:44,520
continue to Target like open source uh

1492
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,780
products right they are widely used

1493
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,540
right to achieve right that widespread

1494
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,220
Downstream access right to the victim

1495
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,720
organizations that make use of these

1496
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,579
products right and last but not least

1497
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:55,140
but we have also seen that the service

1498
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,880
have basically switched their sites

1499
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,559
right has turned their sites to the

1500
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,240
cloud and continuous environment right

1501
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,380
and

1502
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,180
and just like how they have achieved

1503
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,059
right uh how they have like you know

1504
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:08,579
use ingenious and Innovative methods

1505
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:11,280
right to achieve access right into the

1506
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,980
the software and and hardware supply

1507
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,720
chains right we I think we can also act

1508
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,240
as cloud and container adoption right

1509
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,819
accelerates right and form right like

1510
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,680
part and parcel of our software supply

1511
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,720
chain right we can also expect right the

1512
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,040
cloud and container environments right

1513
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,140
to be targeted right by the adversaries

1514
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,240
right to achieve right their level of

1515
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,300
access right to achieve the signal

1516
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,140
objectives right that they typically

1517
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,180
would get right with a successful supply

1518
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,880
chain compromise

1519
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,260
so unfortunately supply chain

1520
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,880
compromises right show no signs of

1521
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,359
stopping

1522
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,500
so what can we do right as a community

1523
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,660
right to improve right supply chain

1524
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,059
security right for organization right

1525
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:53,400
first I think we need to start thinking

1526
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,900
about you know supply chain security

1527
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,359
right and think about integrating

1528
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,280
subtraction security as part of your

1529
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,859
Enterprise risk management

1530
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:03,660
process right we need to first you know

1531
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,819
basically educate right our leaders

1532
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:07,920
right our Executives right to think

1533
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,559
about software basically to think about

1534
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,559
supply chain security right as a form of

1535
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:16,260
uh as as a concept of risk management

1536
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,180
right as a concept of risk right to the

1537
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,640
organization right then correspondingly

1538
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,099
right think about how we can you know

1539
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,020
adapt some of our existing risk

1540
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,900
management uh processes right and

1541
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,359
strategies right and adopting them right

1542
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:32,220
as part of and mainstreaming them as

1543
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,420
part of our Enterprise risk management

1544
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,700
right processes

1545
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,099
next we want to think about how we can

1546
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,980
you know you know encourage like the

1547
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,079
developers of the day right to implement

1548
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:44,880
right your secure you know your secure

1549
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,980
development uh processes right so your

1550
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,839
sdlc right your secure development life

1551
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,760
cycle processes and practices basically

1552
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,099
you know encouraging and incentivizing

1553
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:55,740
right your devops teams right to to

1554
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,220
develop like a secure code right and

1555
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,720
because once because if that is done

1556
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,300
right at the Upstream well right it

1557
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,280
basically negates right many of the

1558
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,260
vulnerabilities right and negates a lot

1559
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,579
of the risk that happens Downstream

1560
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:12,660
right off of that right then of course

1561
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,520
supply chain security is also about

1562
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,859
visibility right Supply visibility of

1563
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:18,780
the supply chain right and how do we

1564
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,059
achieve that visibility and how do we

1565
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:23,819
like effectively like you know after

1566
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:27,059
Leverage that visibility to achieve by a

1567
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,640
a good level of security right is to you

1568
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,980
know think about how we can first

1569
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,119
you know

1570
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,520
um

1571
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,900
institutionalized right that visibility

1572
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,640
by having some kind of a bill of

1573
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,500
materials right uh basically an

1574
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,359
inventory right of your software and

1575
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:43,800
your Hardware in your environment right

1576
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,200
then after having that after

1577
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,040
establishing and maintaining that

1578
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,440
inventory how then you can go about you

1579
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,020
know reviewing right that inventory and

1580
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,700
and then after they go about you know

1581
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,800
choosing right trusted vendors and

1582
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,720
suppliers to work with them so that you

1583
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,599
have a you know a a end-to-end right

1584
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,160
secure supply chain

1585
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,680
right and as and to the next Point as I

1586
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,660
mentioned earlier right a lot of the the

1587
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,579
adversaries have also you know turned to

1588
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:10,200
the club and container environments

1589
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,960
right and you know eventually the fact

1590
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,339
that cloud and container environments

1591
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:15,960
will increasingly become part and parcel

1592
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,579
of our supply or the modern supply chain

1593
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:20,160
right we also want to think about you

1594
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,079
know having the right the appropriate

1595
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,880
Cloud security measures right to ensure

1596
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,619
that our cloud and container like

1597
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,900
environments are effectively protected

1598
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,300
and last but not least

1599
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,000
um you know at the core of every type of

1600
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,800
Cyber attack right whether you know that

1601
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,680
the Cyber attack is a traditional right

1602
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,020
uh state sponsored type attack a

1603
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,780
traditional ransomware attack or even a

1604
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,119
x us an example of a sophisticated

1605
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,280
suppression attack as we have seen right

1606
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,780
in many of the examples that we talked

1607
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,540
about earlier today right we really you

1608
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,640
know what makes part of the effective

1609
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,460
like uh you know defense and security

1610
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,140
against these adversaries of the day

1611
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,740
right is to think about you know no like

1612
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,119
it's really about knowing your adversary

1613
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,380
right and how do you go about knowing

1614
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,780
your adversary is really true adopting

1615
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,280
track intelligence right in your

1616
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,440
security organization today so it's

1617
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,359
about knowing your adversary is about

1618
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,280
you know in the in the context of you

1619
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,079
know software suppression security is

1620
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,079
really about getting the requisite by uh

1621
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:20,880
vulnerability intelligence capability

1622
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,980
right in order to defend you know your

1623
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,420
organization against the latest

1624
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,400
disclosures right and how do you go

1625
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,960
about prioritizing your vulnerability

1626
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,700
management processes accordingly and

1627
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,500
last but not but not least you also want

1628
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,359
to think about how you can use like

1629
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,920
attract intelligence capability or

1630
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,900
digital risk monitoring capability right

1631
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,460
to better understand the third party

1632
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,559
risk right that your organization can be

1633
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,660
exposed to right whether you're you know

1634
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,520
whether is it by getting information or

1635
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,440
monitoring for your vendors your

1636
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,180
suppliers your partners right being

1637
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,099
involved in a particular Bridge right

1638
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:51,299
and in having that information

1639
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:52,980
effectively safeguarding your

1640
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,260
organization right all these different

1641
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,299
like facets of intelligence right will

1642
00:59:57,299 --> 01:00:00,359
come into play right in your you know in

1643
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:02,339
your organizations my efforts right to

1644
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,440
achieve right a more robust posture

1645
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,200
towards supply chain security right and

1646
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,220
with that

1647
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,480
um I've come to the end of my

1648
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,520
presentation today uh I hope you know

1649
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,380
the the audience here today have you

1650
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,079
know taken a a few useful pointers from

1651
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,579
this presentation this discussion today

1652
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:19,980
and I I I either thank you for your

1653
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,079
attention for the past 50 minutes or so

1654
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,420
and I you know hope you know I wish you

1655
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,740
know everyone's here right a really

1656
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,500
fruitful right besides right uh for you

1657

know over the next two days right I hope

1658
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,700
you know and and you know this is a good

1659
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,099
time you know for for us for me to to

1660
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,839
pause it and ask is there any questions

1661
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:40,079
or any comments from the audience

1662
