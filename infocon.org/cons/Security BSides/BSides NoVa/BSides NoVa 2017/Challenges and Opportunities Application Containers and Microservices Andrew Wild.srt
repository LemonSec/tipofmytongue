move it a little faster but let me

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important information</font>

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,799
hardware virtualization a quick look

72
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,450
back in time here because virtualization

has been very well understood<font color="#CCCCCC"> it known</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for at least last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years and we talk</font>

about virtualization technology to

you say why important to have these

published documented definitions so that

108

we can all speak the same language and

109

use common term it's very important when

they're completely separate we've done

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,080
remember when you switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to look at</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same chart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or what a container is</font>

200
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,270
you'll see the infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom</font>

201
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,799
and this is the hardware although

202
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,500
containers can run on things beyond

203
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,140
hardware but for the sake of the picture

204
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,030
here digression universal machine the

205
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,159
infrastructure is give you the memory

that computer they're not revisit that's

right on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and anyway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

210
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:22,120
recalled in this case is leveraging

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,799
doctor the doctor engine and then I'm

212
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,210
above<font color="#CCCCCC"> the doctor edge and are the</font>

213
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,330
containers themselves so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is case</font>

214
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,458
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to read it has ancient and</font>

215
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,319
has the binaries and libraries the

216
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,260
applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> run inside a container</font>

217
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,419
require and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that this case</font>

218
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,549
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just three applications one</font>

219
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,409
application per container which is hand

00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,880
on a continuous multiple applications

221
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:49,830
inside of it the principal benefit here

222
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,870
is that when you're developing

223
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:57,930
applications eat tenure container

224
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,720
solution distract the operating system

225
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,130
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application so this means i</font>

226
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">could make a container that I've</font>

227
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed and inside the container</font>

231
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,450
production environment and it eliminates

232
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,339
many of the dependencies that are just

233
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,459
traditionally when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have deployed</font>

234
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,899
software in a monolithic environment

235
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,390
where you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to package the</font>

236
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:30,300
application on copy operation so the

237
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,880
container extracts the application from

238
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,949
the operative this is like an uppers

239
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,130
lovely<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbours so much that they can</font>

240
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,649
build container on the laptop we didn't

241
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,060
work with it fix issues with it and then

242
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:43,649
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very portable to be shared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

243

another development they can do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

244
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,300
thing and add value in finding but

245
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,260
without that we bogged down which is

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,089
detailed trying to get these operations

libraries that are needed and audis

so much attention and focus in the

distracting the operatives in

257
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:22,319
terminating application we talked about

<font color="#E5E5E5">a virtual machine a virtual machine is</font>

distracting the hardware or me operators

260
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,439
so we moved a pop-up attack if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,709
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk about container the</font>

262
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,630
application thing it has an independent

263
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:39,000
implementation the operation room so

264
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,360
that container engine is providing the

268
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,790
virtual machines containers leverage

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,560
abstraction the operating system where a

271
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:03,930
hardware here's a big one container to

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:06,390
rock you just go dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> run and rule your</font>

273
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,180
containers up in matter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds</font>

274
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,770
virtual machines have to be booted even

275
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,140
though operators have got much more

276
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,900
efficient and even though we have felt a

277
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:19,740
drive and ginger much faster it still

278
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:22,170
takes tens of seconds to<font color="#CCCCCC"> boot a virtual</font>

279
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:27,810
machine container will top and single

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:30,150
set so how do you deploy containers well

281
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,640
you can deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> my bare battle you can</font>

282
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,620
buy a server you can install the host

283
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,930
operating system and then you can scroll

284
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">your container 15 edges and then record</font>

285
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:42,270
your fingers right<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that you can learn</font>

286
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,850
container to number machine so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

287
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,220
deploy a virtual machine that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

288
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,900
the host OS for your containers ISM put

289
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,440
in your container<font color="#CCCCCC"> engine and run it that</font>

290
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,270
way you don't do in class you can run

291
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,370
containers on the instruction of service

292
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,970

off with the host the host is a physical

or virtual machine with the operating

containers included in this environment

320
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:18,139
run on it so apparently in the toxins

321
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,490
that means you cannot do a talk and

322

324
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,170
make a good analogy to really explain

328
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,940

shipping containers are the different

331
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,470
compared so when we look at what is it

332
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,480
inter actually you start off with a

333
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,149
container image if you are actually

334
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to execute so the image is a</font>

container images are immutable<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating</font>

338
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,889
that when you build your container image

339
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:06,500
and you run it the image doesn't change

340
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:07,880
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can change into your container if</font>

341
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,519
you want that's not generally the best

342
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,529
practice more I've got white later but

343
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:16,639
the image is right to instantiate the

344
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:18,529
container so how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it get these images</font>

345
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,860
well you can build on yourself and

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:26,110

354
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:47,540
registry so a registry is a way to store

355
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:49,819
images you can have private registries

356
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,160
for public registry if you have a public

357
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:54,349
registries you have access to create a

358

work of many other people but you also

359
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,490
have to concern of what do I know about
