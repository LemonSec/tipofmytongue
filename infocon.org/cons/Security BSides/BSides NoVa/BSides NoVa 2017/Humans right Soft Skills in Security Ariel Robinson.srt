16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,009
night I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at an event in the</font>

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,220
intelligence community I work with

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:13,229
four-star generals and CEOs and I can

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,619
somehow talked to all of them there's a

20
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,979
big gap in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infosec world between</font>

21
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,840
techies and normals or as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we've</font>

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,548
all heard them called muggles because

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,780
that's not full of disdain or anything

24
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,119
right so the thing about security is

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,430
that security especially cybersecurity

26
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,950
information security isn't going to work

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,600
until it works for everyone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,049
call humans the weak link in the chain

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,949
or you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whom and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attain it</font>

30
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:48,840
really doesn't work for humans does it

31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:51,740
so you know either or this is how we see

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:57,090
you accuracy notwithstanding right

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:02:03,509
perception is reality mo meme come back

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:06,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok perception is reality we the infosec</font>

35
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,568
folks techies tend to hang out amongst

36
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,540
yourself and your dark windowless rooms

37
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,730
at conferences with each other and the

38
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,019
only time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to you as</font>

39
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,298
normal is when there's a problem right

40
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:24,299
and something's broken or not doing what

41
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:25,859
it's supposed to be doing and that's not

42
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">really a good way to start a</font>

43
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:32,670
relationship so at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going</font>

65
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,180

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,709
said use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the normals to the</font>

67
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,540
muggles where you're just like why can't

74
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:16,649
great segue because the thing is is that

75
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,750
we don't speak the same language I you

76
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,870
know I become polyglot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll because this</font>

77
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,990
is what I do I'm a journalist and

78
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,639
right now I write for Washington exec

79
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,760
for whom by the way I am NOT speaking

80
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,380
I'm here in my own capacity but one of

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,449
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had to learn is how</font>

82
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,070
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like explain a rap</font>

83
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,660
attack in like 400 words at the

84
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:42,630
executive level why can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

85
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen to me the thing is it's not about</font>

86
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">you we we are artists right you write</font>

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,479
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> I right words at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

88
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,340
we all take immense pride in the work

89
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we do in creating what it is that</font>

90
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,900
we create the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you're</font>

91
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to live off your art you have to</font>

92
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,489
be prepared to do it to someone else's

93
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,680
standards I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a Twitter fight the</font>

94
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,330
other day not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge one just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,020
one with the guy who said something

96
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,909
something like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know oh don't don't</font>

97
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,430
ask me for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Picasso if you only have</font>

98
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,240
finger painters to maintain it and I

99
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,410
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well if it was easier to maintain</font>

100
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,949
maybe finger painters would have been

101
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,600
enough and he said well<font color="#CCCCCC"> no no you can't</font>

102
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,150
just ask me for a secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> moon diamond</font>

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the words words words right and I</font>

104
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like hmm if I don't know what that</font>

105
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">is as someone who spent some time in and</font>

106
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,430
around all y'all my guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your</font>

107
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,510
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably didn't ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

108
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,820
that because they probably don't know

109
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,130
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is either especially if they</font>

110
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,169
only have finger painters my guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

111
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,389
that what they really wanted was

112
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,690
something that was you know at finger

113
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:51,419
painter level it sucks we all like

114
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:55,080
perfection and we know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

115
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,448
sense of what security means right but

116
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,120
you can't give someone a solution they

117
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,490
don't want or one they can't maintain or

118
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,530
when they can't use the best tool isn't

119
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,479
going to matter if it requires going

120
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the command code and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> typing's of</font>

121
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,930
stuff like be PDP I spent so much time

122
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:17,780
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get PGP to work and like it</font>

123
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:20,460
just just know so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

124
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,679
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone else's</font>

125
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,859
standards this means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to listen</font>

126
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,240
right

127
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:33,510
how to do that how to human as

128
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,090
frustrating as it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback like why</font>

129
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:40,310
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> digest is exactly that its user</font>

130
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:45,119
feedback why can't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stay logged in</font>

131
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:48,120
right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> language that they use is a</font>

132
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,650
good indicator of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of their own</font>

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,350
understanding of whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

134
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,940
talking about right why can't I just use

135
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,010
the same authentication app for two

136
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,040
factor for one email as I can for the

137
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,300
other email right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I know what to</font>

138
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,450
factor is and I know what an

139
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,430
authentication app is versus like why

140
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,190
can't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know print from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

141
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,110
laptop right<font color="#CCCCCC"> two different levels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

142
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,300
understanding when you're communicating

143
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,760
you have to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in their</font>

144
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,290
language and not yours if you want them

145
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:22,680
to understand you second as a reporter

146
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,570
and in the policy world one of the first

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,370
things you learn especially after coming

148
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,860
out of college when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you write 20 page</font>

149
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,430
papers isn't no one reads 20 page papers

150
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,040
bottom line up front right you have you

151
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,370
have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> two sentences to get to the</font>

152
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,810
point this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of goes back to that</font>

153
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:45,180
it's not about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thing as well and I</font>

154
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,580
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how something</font>

155
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:52,350
works to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it another</font>

156
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:58,650
Twitter fight a guy was bitching about

157
00:07:52,350 --> 00:08:01,650
how dumb users are and yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was I was</font>

158
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,299
saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know he's like you can't</font>

159
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,500
you can't have a security tool if you

160
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,420
don't know how it works and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I</font>

161
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,280
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how my car works to be able</font>

162
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to drive it no not not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact</font>

163
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,690
all I need to know is the base level of

164
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,140
maintenance right and then when I need

165
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,760
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the professionals that's</font>

166
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,560
all I need to know so when you're

167
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,990
interacting with your customers or<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

168
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,720
project managers or your muggles<font color="#E5E5E5"> /</font>

169
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:34,380
normals right think about what it is

170
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,469
that they care about similarly while

171
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">info sex might be like your lives or our</font>

172
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,349
lot

173
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-four/seven like your CEO has a</font>

174
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,029
lot of other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about this</font>

175
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:47,040
is another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

176
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">think infosec folks get really</font>

177
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,310
frustrated with I've seen it again

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,389
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter fight it like two days</font>

179
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:58,258
ago I want Twitter a lot i'm in media

180
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:59,819
but this guy said you know in reference

181
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,430
to a breach oh it's the same mistake

182
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:05,329
that companies always make if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

183
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,349
want to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said well</font>

184
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:09,599
sometimes there are other factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

185
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,880
play if you're a small business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,560
choices spend X dollars on marketing so

187
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,990
that you can you know sustain your

188
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,349
business or X dollars on beefing up your

189
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,699
security it's not much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a choice is it</font>

190
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,889
right so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because people have</font>

191
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:24,930
different priorities doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

192
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:27,630
they're wrong and for the love of<font color="#E5E5E5"> God</font>

193
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't treat us like we're stupid again</font>

194
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because we have different</font>

195
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,380
priorities doesn't mean that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

196
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,620
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> or that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

197
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,120
know what happens when you're an asshole

198
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,730
nobody wants to listen to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

199
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,139
socio-technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> divide gets worse and we</font>

200
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:50,000
get further and further from each other

201
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:53,760
and bad feelings all around so humans

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,970
we're different from you right humans

203
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,160
are not logical they are not binary or

204
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:03,380
as I recently learned humans are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

205
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,149
closed systems right the thing is

206
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,939
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> so fairly predictable in fact</font>

207
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:11,190
there are centuries<font color="#CCCCCC"> of science looking</font>

208
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,410
at how humans make decisions human

209
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,199
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> psychology cognitive science</font>

210
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,560
economics right it's not like we're

211
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,969
completely unknown variables so bring

212
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that into how you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about your</font>

213
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,670
solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking on rally</font>

214
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,800
security earlier this week and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

215
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,569
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the science behind this please</font>

216
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,000
go check out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk because i had an</font>

217
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:37,610
hour then and I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like not much time</font>

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,819
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be brought into</font>

219
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,290
how we design security tools and Danny

220
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:45,959
of who I was speaking to it was like man

221
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,089
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot like what I learned in my</font>

222
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,119
social engineering training and I said

223
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,040
yeah

224
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,990
everyone in security should be getting

225
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,390
social engineering training right

226
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,040
there's there's a reason that nine times

227
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,660
out of ten the best way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

228
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,339
network is through social engineering

229
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,500
it's because a lot of the time we don't

230
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:08,560
think about humans when we build these

231
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:11,560
tools right so in group and out group as

232
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,849
animals which humans are one of the

233
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,550
first things that we do is establish

234
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,740
whether you are like me or not like me

235
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,510
this goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being an asshole and</font>

236
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,370
this goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to being not about you</font>

237
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:25,900
right from the beginning the first thing

238
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to do is try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

239
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,360
figure out are you on my side you guys

240
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,920
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outsiders you're the people that</font>

241
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,810
stay in your rooms that don't have faces

242
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,849
and we're scheme up for just show of

243
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,469
hands who's actually ever worn a ski

244
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:44,290
mask in a serious in a serious context

245
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:47,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay they're like four which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

246
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:50,279
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was expecting good to know</font>

247
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,410
so you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are outsiders your unknowns</font>

248
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:57,880
your anonymous<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that I mean you might</font>

249
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,829
be but different I mean it in the

250
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">civilian sense I guess right your</font>

251
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,820
unknown and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary right people</font>

252
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,680
are afraid of what they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so</font>

253
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suspicious and</font>

254
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,089
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as Outsiders from the beginning</font>

255
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,250
so the thing is is that once you're in

256
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,860
you're good to go right once you've

257
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,360
built that base level of trust you're on

258
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inside it's pretty hard to get</font>

259
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,480
kicked out from the inside so at the end

260
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,839
of the day again security isn't going to

261
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,370
work until it works for everyone and I

262
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,320
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave you with my little</font>

263
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret of how I've learned to become</font>

264
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,700
polyglot<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh and that is i sit and i</font>

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,250
listen or stands and I listen and I let

266
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys talk or whomever it is right</font>

267
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:46,089
four-star generals talk executive<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop</font>

268
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:49,330
and then I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what you're saying</font>

269
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,830
is blankety blankety blank and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

270
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,680
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance to confirm or correct</font>

271
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,839
yeah like oh great because that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

272
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,329
needed to know right or are they say

273
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,780
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like this and I'm and I'm</font>

274
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:02,280
good

275
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:04,660
right listen listen to their language

276
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,770
translate for yourself right don't

277
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,230
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what they're</font>

278
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,270
talking about because especially in the

279
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,570
with the knowledge gap between technical

280
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:17,319

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,450
chance to confirm a correct and listen

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,880
the communication breakdowns that you

292
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:50,430

298
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,150
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is a so the question</font>

299
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,520
was have I gone to an event in the past

300
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,220
and seen a total cluster and then gone

301
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">again in the future and see neither</font>

302
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,730
muggle / normals learn to speak tech or

303
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,410
the other way around where text going to

304
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:52,180
speak muggles and it reminds me<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

305
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:56,800
quick story that I that I forgot to

306
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:59,349
mention my so my I've only been in and

307
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">around this world for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly short</font>

308
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,650
amount of time and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> more stressed</font>

309
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,690
out first coming to an infosec event

310
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:11,110
then I was cold calling special

311
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:15,560
operations forces not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> kidding</font>

312
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,570
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I've like I've learned so</font>

313
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,250
you know where i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am now versus where i</font>

314
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:23,240
was six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months or a year ago it's a very</font>

315
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,459
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> place and I've met a lot of</font>

316
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,399
folks to who have sort of more an

317
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:33,439
individual level been reaching out and

318
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,860
then engaged with trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bridge this</font>

319
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,829
gap so again like the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gents at rally</font>

320
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,420

321
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,790
like hey we're talking about soft skills

322

327
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,750

328
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,639
actually been really encouraged at what

329
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,560
I've seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of people trying to</font>

330
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:37,510
reach out and bridge the gap is that the

331
00:16:00,560 --> 00:17:07,448
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it's going to happen yeah oh</font>

332
00:16:37,510 --> 00:17:07,449
yeah acronyms right right yeah

333
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,020
so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great question the question</font>

334
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,720
you know we don't we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time for</font>

335
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">12 steps where what are three things</font>

336
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,870
that we can do I one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the</font>

337
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,150
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been listening to I do</font>

338
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:26,629
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work around women in tech and</font>

339
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,300
minorities in tech and one of the things

340
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we hear a lot is two ears one mouth</font>

341
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:37,310
right listen twice as much as you talk

342
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:39,770
the forest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consigo is what is the big</font>

343
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:43,159
barrier between folks in this community

344
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:45,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other communities and normal so</font>

345
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,960
whoever normals is Right whether you're

346
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,640
in the military and normals are

347
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,320
civilians whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're special</font>

348
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,480
operations and normals of the other guys

349
00:17:51,320 --> 00:18:01,970
like the the forest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of contigo confusion</font>

350
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:07,330
and ego is why is like the main reason

351
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:11,390
that these barriers exist right so

352
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:13,250
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not about you listen to</font>

353
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the language that they're using and you</font>

354
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:19,640
mirror right so you use the words that

355
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">they use if you don't understand those</font>

356
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">words you can do one of two things and I</font>

357
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,740
say this as a journalist and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was a</font>

358
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,860
freelance writer like secret you guys my

359
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,960

360
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,790
have the best job where I get paid to

361
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,500
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really smart people and then</font>

362
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,350
write about it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like getting my own</font>

363
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,150
PhD<font color="#CCCCCC"> without having to go to school but</font>

364
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,090
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that I'm the dumb one in</font>

365
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,980
the room like most of the time so listen

366
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,290
if there's something you don't know

367
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">either ask or write it down and look it</font>

368
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:54,170
up later and and learn right use their

369
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,870
own would use their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own language back</font>

370
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,420
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with respect and show that</font>

371
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,669
you're trying right I think that's

372
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,590
that's one of the biggest you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

373
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,690
like listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have it wash over you</font>

374
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,330
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and people will</font>

375
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,980
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will pick up on that they can</font>

376
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,260
tell by your facial<font color="#CCCCCC"> expressions by your</font>

377
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,190
body posture whether you're open or

378
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,049
whether you're close all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

379
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:28,480
really matters

380
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:30,129
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope those are helpful yeah what's</font>

381
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,259
the most effective effective way to

382
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:37,149
convince an executive of the value of

383
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:41,049
security unfortunately if the you got to

384
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:42,789
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business case yeah it has to be</font>

385
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:46,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the bottom line</font>

386
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:48,610
and you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have to recognize</font>

387
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:50,799
that they have other priorities right

388
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,649
namely that bottom line but so when but

389
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,179
not not just that but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to</font>

390
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">be out your security doesn't happen in a</font>

391
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,590
vacuum right they have training<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

392
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,480
right how much is your tool going to

393
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,350
cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> them just to train people to use</font>

394
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,580
it's not going to be a barrier to entry

395
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,049
how frequently are they going to have to

396
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,840
update stuff are they going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

397
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,668
