security product companies we were

founded in 2013 really based on I think

101
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,110
the recognition that in the region

diversify our economic growth away from

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,659
contracting and federal budgets so

124
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,280
that's an accelerator that we thought

125
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,700
could put effectively harness a

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,580
we find them if there's an opportunity

148
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">for them to commercialize it we advocate</font>

149
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,609
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them that means we make an</font>

150
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,630
investment in them and we teach<font color="#E5E5E5"> them how</font>

151
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:44,050
to build that idea into a thriving

152
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:47,229
commercial company so that's why our

153
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:50,320
advocacy for technical founders is

154
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:51,940
important to us that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have since</font>

155
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,940
we started we've had a relationship with

156
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,490
these sides and we're thrilled to

213
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,050
whether it's a vendor commercial

whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ash where they kind of talk</font>

some feedback on that um<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so to</font>

238
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,730
cyber market it's really broken down

239
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,950
into three areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are looking at</font>

240
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,680
head<font color="#E5E5E5"> grease how's it going on people are</font>

241
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,600
really looking for us I'm just honored

242
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">by we take people came up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um so</font>

243
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,020
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the especially on a Saturday</font>

244
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,430
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market is really broken down at</font>

245
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,589
32

246
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,750
profitez<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look for bad</font>

247
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,460
things people who look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> good things</font>

248
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then people who realize that neither</font>

249
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,640
of those two things work and they want

250
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to throw things away and start over</font>

251
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,020
right so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it mean that's a bad</font>

252
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,870
thing it means we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live for</font>

253
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,000
evil on our network right and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have so</font>

254
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,010
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different versions of what evil is</font>

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,320
when you buy an antivirus product you're

256
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,140
trusting that vendor to look for evil on

257
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,290
your on your laptop but that market has

258
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,959
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for a long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and there's</font>

259
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,670
no way to like define what evil and

260
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,369
badness and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shouldn't be on</font>

261
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,779
my network really really are so we've

262
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,640
seen a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different technology</font>

263
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:12,410
coming out go back 20 years you

264
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,080
basically have firewalls and antivirus

265
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,550
type product and those didn't work

266
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,459
should we bought network intrusion

267
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:22,939
detection systems and those didn't work

268
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:24,619
so we turned on prevention right into

269
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,480
that the guy I'm trying not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> despair I</font>

270
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,950
mean I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that area like you guys</font>

271
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,380
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean when it's seven more</font>

272
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,060
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a perfect solution there's</font>

273
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,459
no black box solution out there where

274
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,719
you can turn things on and go home at

275
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,729
night right we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not doing</font>

276
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,650
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so you know so after the</font>

277
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,480
network IDs and IPS things when things

278
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,730
started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get real interesting we had</font>

279
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,650
to have contact so that shim market was

280
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,630
born let's start gathering all these

281
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,750
laws and put them into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one spot</font>

282
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,400
and that caused a lot of help for some

283
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,839
people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> created a lot of jobs and</font>

284
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,640
certifications<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caused without a</font>

285
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,200
pain and suffering and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

286
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,449
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the biggest breaches that happen</font>

287
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,370
you know OPM<font color="#CCCCCC"> jpmorgan you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know different</font>

288
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,170
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these guys had lots of</font>

289
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,640
sex they had lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people looking at</font>

290
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,860
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were out there I'm</font>

291
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,689
sorry happened after that when we got

292
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,310
into a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

293
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,650
really like last couple years people

294
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,239
have basically said we assume we are

295
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,520
going to be hacked we assume we are

296
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,900
going to be compromised so now we need

297
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,089
forensics right collectors from the end

298
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,470
point we have this ed our market we need

299
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:23,150
for infants from the networks or the

300
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,860
rebirth of products like like netwitness

301
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,260
maybe they can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud all</font>

302
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,149
that kind of stuff and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and</font>

303
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,189
more telemetry that doesn't talk a bit

304
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,690
more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later and then some of</font>

305
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that we thought the sim was</font>

306
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,170
supposed to do that was showing up

307
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,610
another product let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just look at</font>

308
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,469
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> lab</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see if Lauren</font>

309
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,730
gurus credentials showed up somewhere

310
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,850
else that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UVA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mark user behavior</font>

311
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,949
anomaly detection and whatnot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

312
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,630
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that stuff going on the last</font>

313
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:50,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that happened was fighting the</font>

314
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">last year or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so is sort of a dearth of</font>

315
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,268
machine learning and artificial

316
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,888
intelligence there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

317
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:58,170
said look I can share it on your network

318
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,000
gather all your telemetry and I can do

319
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,469
statistics I can call a machine learning

320
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,420
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically at the end of the day I'm</font>

321
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,949
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you if something change or</font>

322
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,709
summarize everything in such a way that

323
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:09,240
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can analyst can go with things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

324
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:12,420
change just because you had a spike in

325
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,769
DNS queries or<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire labs or something</font>

326
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,880
like that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a PT on</font>

327
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:16,889
your network but maybe that's something

328
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should go and investigate there's</font>

329
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,360
another type of machine learning there

330
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:23,489
which is hey let's look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity from</font>

331
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,620
all over the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then create</font>

332
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,120
intelligence to share with an individual

333
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,889
customer and that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

334
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting that's like silence that's</font>

335
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:32,010
basically people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are looking like</font>

336
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:33,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">opendns they look at the queries from</font>

337
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,610
all over the internet and we benefit

338
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,350
from that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analysis that we can</font>

339
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,269
debate if it's machine learning if it's

340
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,820
AI but you're really leveraging the

341
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,380
internet as a whole and bringing that

342
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,940
back and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll actually have</font>

343
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,250
personally your motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we kind</font>

344
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,680
of did a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tony</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pops up at BBN</font>

345
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,810
and I really like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state of</font>

346
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the art going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pentester you</font>

347
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,319
know there's real active honey pots on

348
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,699
the net before the tourney tokens

349
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:58,380
whether it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks like</font>

350
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">the corporate exchange server that's</font>

351
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to give you pause and you know</font>

352
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,910
make you very difficult to go over

353
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,589
there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new vendors out in</font>

354
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,850
that space so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're really doing and</font>

355
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:08,100
making make you needed my biggest

356
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,589
criticism the Pony pop is always then so

357
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,180
has it set up there you can you can have

358
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:14,069
a lot of legal issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font>

359
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,569
of problems operationally the new

360
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:16,800
vendors that are out there tracks is one

361
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:19,229
of them at no relation with that other

362
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of like the technology it's</font>

363
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,779
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting tool also to look up</font>

364
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,459
alright so that's finding bad stuff and

365
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,500
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to Q&A later so much I said</font>

366
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of Product X Y Z happy</font>

367
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,120
to answer that not in front of everybody

368
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">so all right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's end up finding</font>

369
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">good thing you guys do have seen this</font>

370
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,740
equation right risk equals threat time

371
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:44,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">is variability let me actually done it</font>

372
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,260
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> will you take necesita ec2 SS scores</font>

373
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,449
and multiple times like smoke severity

374
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,760
scores you know there's products out

375
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:54,410
there that do that right I and it's

376
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:57,620
interesting is it the rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you know</font>

377
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,199
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work at scale</font>

378
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,029
this is a great concept to teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

379
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,199
you know I've actually seen some people

380
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,050
there and they still expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

381
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,939
vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> times asset or threat tons</font>

382
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">better asset criticality right times</font>

383
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,050
availability times the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

384
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,120
on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> wheels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like our conflicts of risk</font>

385
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,160
is really we don't have it we've been in

386
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,740
this industry for 30 years now we don't

387
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,449
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way that i can say a your version</font>

388
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,870
of risking your version of rest is the

389
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:25,639
same so then you know we wonder why my

390
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,410
password is going from trans characters

391
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,240
to 13 characters when somebody changes

392
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,790
of possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> which there's no connection</font>

393
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,480
between those two things so the current

394
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:37,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">state</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of finding cyber good is kind of</font>

395
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,589
all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole other story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to</font>

396
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,379
tell is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i met a senior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

397
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:44,420
official one they're not in the room and

398
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,769
I said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know hey what do you want to</font>

399
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,378
do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like oh I want to I want</font>

400
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:51,230
to disrupt habits I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

401
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:53,839
fairer for hackers and nation space to

402
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,720
operate on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my on my network and and I</font>

403
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,759
said oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like I found biological yeah</font>

404
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,920
it'll be like forcing users to go

405
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,810
through a box again but the patching

406
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems like strong authentication</font>

407
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">essentially two factors yeah yeah yeah</font>

408
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,829
oh you mean compliance no we don't want

409
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,899
any of that on the network right but I

410
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,609
got to tell you I've given sure to be

411
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,800
pleased I go out I do a lot of different

412
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking to either pen tester clouds and</font>

413
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,569
incident responding clouds and almost

414
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:23,600
everybody in these clouds is in bed with

415
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:24,979
some sure as you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stands which</font>

is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center for Internet Security</font>

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,699
little critical controls this cyber

418
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,259
security framework I so different things

419
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:33,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you throw out that</font>

420
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:35,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">web framework a lot of times to go no no</font>

421
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:36,889
no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be internet responder I</font>

422
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,589
want to be a mal reverse engineer and

423
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:42,110
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you again will</font>

424
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,759
add rash another bet and when you say

425
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,290
around a remand network of certain right

426
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,079
here's the words i have this network to

427
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,719
live by that's kind of a framework and a

428
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,550
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times what's happened to date in</font>

429
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,889
2017 we didn't verbal<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level on</font>

430
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,019
with these frameworks so what do we have

431
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:59,449
we have a gap we have a gap between<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

432
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,910
on the network now and the famous<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

433
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:03,979
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going to be recommended or</font>

434
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,480
possibly required in the future now look

435
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,040
going on with frameworks right with that

436
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,260
the fans like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

437
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,569
said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't said pci yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

438
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,430
believe PCI's a framework and because

439
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,869
it's very comprehensive about how you're

440
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,580
going to control your data and different

441
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,810
things like that and you know the

442
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,849
government come out with the NIST

443
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,109
cybersecurity framework if your deity of

444
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rich measurement management</font>

445
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,800
framework and all things like that if

446
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,959
you read these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and this is your</font>

447
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,290
first exposure to cybersecurity you will

448
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:34,170
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> press right these are this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

449
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">very very long so it's a complex thing</font>

450
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,620
information security we still have the

451
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,510
confidentiality integrity and

452
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,580
availability but then you're like error

453
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,870
i want my users to VPN and over my

454
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,540
exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move it to the</font>

455
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:48,899
cloud right so if it gets complex really

456
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,580
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe is</font>

457
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to happen though is that you're</font>

458
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,919
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see new approaches to measuring</font>

459
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,450
risk so there's companies out there that

460
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,940
basically claimed that they can measure

461
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,700
risk maybe they look for evidence of

462
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">your data online maybe they look for</font>

463
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,850
evidence of compromises from your

464
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,440
organization online and they're going to

465
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,090
play about<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk management that's great</font>

466
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,980
tell me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

467
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,929
looking inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewall and but that</font>

468
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,340
still is not I'm not a bad way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of both</font>

469
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great there's other people who</font>

470
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,120
look inside the failure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they run a</font>

471
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,740
test to the CFO and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after</font>

472
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,929
the birth which means a lot of high

473
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,730
priority<font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then this process</font>

474
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,800
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk with a fair matter</font>

475
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,960
where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically say give me a list</font>

476
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,120
of REO asset you need a list of your

477
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,220
liability right look if you have PRI on

478
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,050
this asset and you use credit cards on

479
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,580
or personal data you're subject to a

480
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,280
fifty-thousand-dollar fine that's that

481
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,929
goes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left column and then they</font>

482
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,090
put all the controls associated with

483
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,560
those things and they run an algorithm

484
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,629
and it says look if you implement this

485
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,310
controller at control you will reduce

486
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,630
your risk by those dollars and cents and

487
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,940
that's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the mission</font>

488
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,400
missing in our cybersecurity sort of

489
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,680
vocabulary as an industry so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

490
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,090
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to happen I also think</font>

491
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to happen because the</font>

492
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,530
insurance people people realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

493
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,700
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the answers and they</font>

494
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some sort of cyber</font>

495
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,000
insurance and the cyber insurance people

496
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,220
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically saying we can cover</font>

497
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,840
cryptolocker so we have no idea how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

498
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,880
cover that real risk or anything like

499
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,100
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> when these frameworks are used</font>

500
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,540
more often and more pronounced

501
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,219
throughout the industry you're going to

502
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,750
see more exposure to those kind of

503
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,970
things with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of conversations going</font>

504
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,490
on companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> have said in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this place</font>

505
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,200
gah what they're doing if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hears</font>

506
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">anybody had to get a shock to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> audit from</font>

507
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the vendor that they work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

508
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,659
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the data as you should</font>

509
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,309
learn with others because you can add

510
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:34,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your resume and be more valuable</font>

511
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:36,510
to your company's right so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patti Rick</font>

512
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,340
so you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing contrasting we</font>

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,500
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marilyn otherwise we risk for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">such bullshit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using Amazon if using only</font>

516
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,440
external data centers for example you've

517
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,350
got to have probably some sort of record

518
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,789
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how are they they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> china</font>

519
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">bay we had almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred external</font>

customers we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had such time employees</font>

521
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,500
just manage and we sing so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could go</font>

back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the bo Diaz the rest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

524
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,750
like cyber geo that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> our gathering and</font>

525
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,570
crowdsourcing this kind of stuff and

526
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing making this about easier that's</font>

527
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,289
data that the cyber industry could use

528
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:10,280
to actually come up with actuaries and

529
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:13,020
find one way or another to do them but

530
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,250
if this compliance and frameless is a

531
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,559
little bit tough i'm going to point you

532
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,720
in in a presentation here so this was

533
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,000
two years ago afternoon he who looked at

534
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,950
bank of america<font color="#E5E5E5"> people generally RSA and</font>

535
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,260
he said look you can summarize the NIST

536
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,000
cybersecurity<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework this way it's</font>

537
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,429
basically prescriptive it's that fibers

538
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,710
identifies protect the tech respond and

539
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,750
recover so then he thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it in</font>

540
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,780
terms of my devices might ask my network

541
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:40,020
my data and my users so you and this is

542
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interesting to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

543
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,908
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we complex things you think about</font>

544
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,650
IP addresses network diagram you know

545
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,940
telemetry vulnerabilities are from

546
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,070
things like that but when you do this

547
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,350
and you put it onto a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small breakfast</font>

548
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,120
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a sub for vendors so to</font>

549
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,908
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what you have in your</font>

550
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,899
network and what your answer is for

551
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:02,549
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> these control now i'm not i think</font>

552
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search that is on here</font>

553
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:05,789
audience but it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

554
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,559
vendors around here this is so you know

555
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:09,150
what you're doing and you can

556
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">communicate this to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

557
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,590
organization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer says that if</font>

558
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,940
you've got blades<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you know to use</font>

559
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,830
that shortcut so in this case the

560
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,690
recovery program is very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much open</font>

561
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,520
if you get earned if you have gotta

562
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,600
laugh you got to recover that's not

563
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,760
something your putter going to get good

564
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,320
at until<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens that when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

590
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,030
there's sort of a move to basically say

591
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:20,070
how can I reduce the risk on my network

592
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,230
and there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

599
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,860

you'll trust how they do it you don't

615
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is is a complex that maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go ahead</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of sand backing it up you have so much</font>

complexity just to move email around and

618
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,840
then here comes a salesperson for

619
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,330
Microsoft that says I can basically

620
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,720
replace all that with basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> some API</font>

621
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:27,570
to the internet card app is 365 now the

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bergen is Microsoft has all your data so</font>

623
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,439
they can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of do a better job running</font>

624
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,750
an email server then perhaps your IT

625
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,250
people can and that's a terrible

626
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,360
slaughter when I look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> you listed in</font>

627
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,300
rep looking that would stay to the left

628
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,520
which we can run the data better than

629
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,220
you can because that's all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did and by</font>

630
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,500
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we run 100 copies of Oracle</font>

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,049
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> see beds before you do we're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see attacks against this</font>

634
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,940

635
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,770
a monolithic application like email it

636
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,320
becomes really really easy to spot

637
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:00,179
attacked misconfigurations performance

638
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,918
issues different things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but a</font>

639
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:05,370
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people are basically saying I</font>

640
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,710
don't need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> run IT anymore I t is a</font>

641
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,959
very complex and Brandon thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

642
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,150
outsource I can give it to other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

643
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,490
and when you do that you get some

644
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,559
benefit now that the problem Moses you

645
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,940
got to give them your data and as much

646
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you can go through a data provider</font>

647
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,840
and see how certified they are and they

648
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,400
can carry with you cryptid from the

649
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
ground up and stuff like that the vast

650
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,090
majority of people in talking to them

651
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,980
industry your view this as an experiment

652
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,139
unless you're on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> west coast then you</font>

653
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,030
just start out and you're using gmail

654
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,679
and doing things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

655
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,570
kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> filling on right now now</font>

656
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,250
another thing is going on is our devices

657
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,799
are the bases are getting phenomenally

658
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,780
better and we still have<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero days we</font>

659
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,549
still have things like that that they're

660
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,830
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost of those zero days it's</font>

661
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,690
really really up there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">about can't access that they run the</font>

663
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,450
poem the only thing where they have

664
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,120
teams that go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and they have every</font>

say hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roland that's that's that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

668
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,370
good like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are heavy and</font>

669
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,620
everybody on the team of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> left we</font>

670
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,059
had to what the hardest we could the

671
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">other thing is you guys are here I'm</font>

672
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,928
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for the CIA a day job and</font>

673
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,549
stuff like that finding team to do

674
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:13,080
reverse engineering and vulnerability

675
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:15,450
discovery is getting harder and harder

676
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,010
to do the industry is getting better

677
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,480
Michael shop didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> gather Google's</font>

678
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,010
getting better they're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

679
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,659
fixing things so the endpoints are

680
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,340
getting a lot this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically that I</font>

681
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,380
was to go to the cloud right if I trust

682
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,570
this device and I trust up with the data

683
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,610
set the cloud I have a much simpler way

684
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,830
of measuring our my stuff in my asset

685
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,600
and yet not and then the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

686
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,330
that every company no matter who they

687
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">are whether they are on government that</font>

688
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,129
would lay an automotive manufacturer

689
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,690
they are shaft with engineering shop and

690
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,830
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done what we can do with</font>

691
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,929
source code are going well you know

692
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:48,539
their code did you tie all those kind of

693
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:50,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing it doesn't give you guaranteed</font>

694
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,340
security so what people are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

695
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,658
is reduce the complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how are</font>

696
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,280
they reducing the complexity have a

697
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,960
complex application of<font color="#CCCCCC"> web enabled there</font>

698
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,090
removing the complexes and what did I

699
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,730
mean why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say complexity I mean the</font>

700
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:06,070
operating system I mean the web server I

701
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,380
mean maybe the disc in the firmer that

702
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,899
it's booting on you can take most web

703
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,730
applications and rewrite them in a much

704
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,160
simpler with much less lines of code

705
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,020
with your ear<font color="#CCCCCC"> protectors containers for</font>

706
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,050
example but took advantage of elasticity

707
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,150
the Amazon API where you have s3 buckets

just let you kind of go and query things

know different kind of solutions that

790
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:20,079
are out there to kind of augment those

over budget that ever Wi-Fi was over

819

849
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,749
they can create a workflow that the

<font color="#E5E5E5">follow in front of the dns servers down</font>

851
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:27,190
and / 22 ssh is opening in those

852
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:29,279
connections that we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> there before</font>

853

we're not seeing those kind of things in

<font color="#CCCCCC">stocks today I kinda already mention</font>

855
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:38,259
this you know if you go is SAS course if

856
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:39,728
you go to office 365 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to</font>

857
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:41,830
offend anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> but those probably do a</font>

858
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:44,320

and you running your own email now so

860
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,739
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not criticizing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sub dad is</font>

861
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:55,029
basically exactly like lapis 365 them

862
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:56,080
since we got out on said but they're

863
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,970
trying to do the right thing you're

864
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,090
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very open to those</font>

865
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,739
architectures and doom crowd first and

866
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,428
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I talked a</font>

867
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:08,349
whole whole hour on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

870
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:16,289
really for you know the smaller SMB I

871
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:19,210
really believe if you're a small company

872
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:21,489
small company could be thousand people

873
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,440
right tenable right I used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel like</font>

874
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:25,629
I got the best IT security people

875
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,609
running my exchange server and then we

876
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:30,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">switched to google gmail and it was like</font>

877
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:32,019
oh yeah yeah they see traffic from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

878
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:34,450
internet we see traffic the tenable and

879
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,410
that's you can't compete<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that right</font>

880
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,730
so if you're going to put

881
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,410
dissipate with something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

882
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,590
guys you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so by</font>

883
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:44,830
default cloud apps are better for

886
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,240

897
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,940
awesome and the plan was a just had

898
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,160
though is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe I would call it</font>

899
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,540
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just came out but you can expose</font>

900
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,740
credentials that might have gone through

901
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,530
that kind of stuff again it's called

902
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,030
cloud bleed ibis just came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

903
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:27,639
not up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed one hundred percent on</font>

904
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:31,570
it and said that such as the mystery of

905
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,700
the week<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've seen is this if you</font>

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,950
have arcsight if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two one if you</font>

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,280
have on search box click any modern

enterprise vandal and then you have and

909
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,210
again I'm not trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> criticize better</font>

910
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,680
so you have somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who says I can take</font>

911
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,970
maybe five percent of that features that

912
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,580
are come percent of that feature set

913
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,910
whether your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon click web interface</font>

915
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:56,470
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of those kind of company</font>

916
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not saying the bad because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lemming</font>

917
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,650
I'll tell you is from enterprise

918
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,960
companies people don't prepare a hundred

919

percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our pets so having a cloud</font>

00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,460
security application that does exactly

921
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:09,130
what you needed to do that might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

922
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,110
great thing so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> confuse a country</font>

923
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,630
left six months earth with a couple of

16<font color="#CCCCCC"> years herb you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know doing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

925
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:19,360
pricing and the thing is if you go to

926
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,009
RSA you're seeing the Prairie to entry

927
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,900
to kind of get into RSA is where though

928
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,250
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the class that was not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

deploying<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trend and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

931
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:29,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">are things that when you have engineers</font>

932
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,989
working on them your politics get better

933
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,820
so all I'm saying is take security apps

934
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,959
that are quieter only with the premise

935
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,640
that now I've invested a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">countries I'm just saying as a buyer you</font>

937
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,650
gotta watch our perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

940
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,650
run away

941
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,150
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that when you're</font>

942
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:50,400
outsourcing the shellfish when you're

943
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,930
outsourcing to office 365 then you're

944
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,550
outsourcing your security under you

945
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:55,889
still have to worry about these kind of

946
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,080
things I might manifest success in pci

947
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:59,970
in a framework or in something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

948
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,110
but when you basically give you data to

949
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,359
somebody that you're still responsible

950
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,940
for you're still responsible for keeping

951
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,470
those things alive and well set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

953
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,709
curious what people think about these

take the United to burping on a project

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really basic stuff and well</font>

964
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,790
you'd be surprised how often the plan

learning-based let's learn with normal

994
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:38,970
but it looks different must say that's

995
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:41,130
bad this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

996
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,600
opening<font color="#E5E5E5"> statements they were able to do</font>

997
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,490
that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got ahead of myself with</font>

998
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,930
the premise on which web security how do

1000
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,640
thing how do you save it you got to be

1001
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,650
very new act in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer and very</font>

1002
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,170
understanding of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the limitations of</font>

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems that that are</font>

1004
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,190
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes it's basic business</font>

1005
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,420
right ready with a cheaper solution it's

1006
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,190
the same solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already know that</font>

1007
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:04,100
I was just urges cheaper maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1008
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe it's easier to use maybe it it</font>

1009
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,060
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you better performance right so</font>

1010
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,460
you can do those kind of things and how

1011
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,840
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you solve it so many times and I'm</font>

1012
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,900

up slide it really should there are some

1088
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,649
very low market size and growth I mean

1089
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:56,869
this pitch I'm appellate never<font color="#CCCCCC"> lived the</font>

00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:03,349
that's you know and that's where guilty

1095
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:10,130
that that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hard to go about</font>

1096
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:12,499
doing that and I've seen it's really

1097
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,789
hard to do this I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> this done to me</font>

1098
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:16,339
at tenable then we went out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and did that</font>

serious and frankly you know when you

1103
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it if you can get it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down it</font>

1107
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,509
I do believe in half hour meeting I do

the future that's that's resilient we'll

1121
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:03,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about a little bit of new rules I</font>

1122
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:04,999
gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five slide type of pitch and I</font>

1123
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:06,559
wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a maybe a little bit the</font>

1124
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:09,019
Pentecost but I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your</font>

1125
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,819
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> at sessions people that says</font>

1126
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:12,939
yes we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Q&A all right</font>

1127
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:12,940
great

1128
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,970
so for the clips in the other room I

1129
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,500
believe your question was you know if

1130
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,569
you have connectivity to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet go</font>

1131
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,800
away how does that affect where I'm

1132
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,290
recommending which is basically to

1133
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,940
embrace office<font color="#E5E5E5"> 365 Salesforce two</font>

1134
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,250
different different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that so</font>

1135
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,780
that's that's a great question and

1136
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,760
that's part of that whole risk

1137
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,510
management framework so so can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1138
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,920
your work offline you know when you

1139
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">start looking at the reliability of</font>

1140
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,970
another of an urbanization you got power

1141
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,890
so tenable right we have an office up in

1142
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Columbia we had generators we knew the</font>

1143
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,819
generators could only last you know so

1144
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,200
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the thing that hit us the most</font>

1145
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,820
load was internet outages we would have

1146
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">you no connection to the internet that</font>

1147
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,859
one out and different things like that I

1148
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,150
think the bigger you get the more likely

1149
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:37,460
you have multiple connections to the

1150
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet the multiple power sources and</font>

1151
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:43,250
things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're small</font>

1152
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:44,420
that is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a risk I don't know that</font>

1153
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to see an outage on</font>

1154
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">salesforce I don't really see an outage</font>

1155
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:50,660
on Amazon other we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see an</font>

1156
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:52,760
outage now we might that I have a hard

1157
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:55,040
time seeing that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> merely how those</font>

1158
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,450
things are designed having said that if

1159
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go to the competitor where they're</font>

1160
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,930
only on maybe one data center or two

1161
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,669
data centers and the rundi darth away

1162
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,049
from from that you got it you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1163
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,090
keep that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind when you're putting</font>

1164
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:07,730
your data in the club like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said most</font>

1165
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,500
people are curling things on the data

1166
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,970
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff out</font>

1167
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,950
there but like Salesforce is the biggest

1168
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:15,080
what I worry about just because of how

1169
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,490
how much data goes in there for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

1170
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:23,009
I don't know if I answered your

1171
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:24,720
questions mm-hmm

1172
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:27,420
I think the best for that name in the

1173
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,799
nation i was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia and they actually</font>

1174
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,060
didn't want to do the government didn't

1175
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,160
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do business with countable and</font>

1176
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,720
they started a risk that tenable was on

1177
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">south poles and they said you know if</font>

1178
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,000
you have too much stuff on the internet

1179
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,920
too much stuff you could be out of

1180
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,750
business you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribe me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1181
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,000
that's interesting a year later they had

1182
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:45,270
actually opened up the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> rob and the</font>

1183
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,050
government was on gmail you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1184
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:52,759
interesting it really is resting on that

1185
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:54,750
is before somebody says<font color="#CCCCCC"> british on</font>

1186
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,000
itself corset you should they should

1187
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">know with their own outage rated and and</font>

1188
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,830
I've really seen this happen a lab where

1189
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,359
people are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not change you but</font>

1190
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are objecting your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1191
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it means their job right if my job is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1192
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,490
run this exchange servers that I was

1193
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1195
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,330
so just make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the first</font>

1196
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:17,220
somebody has that conversation we know

1197
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,360
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me he</font>

1198
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,520
listened and everything I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1199
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying I which is Spencer's you can't do</font>

1200
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,820
it I be like his left your up time and

1201
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,530
we've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone down so you talked</font>

1202
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">about and I wrote we're down like every</font>

1203
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,040
weekend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and and and that could</font>

1204
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,930
you keep that kind of stuff in mine

1205
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,930
other questions at a common

1206
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,910
so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was literally other</font>

1207
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:56,490
intangible benefits to potential getting

1208
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,899
government investment and year when I

1209
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,419
did these<font color="#E5E5E5"> five things it was really some</font>

1210
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,700
an angel point of view and sometimes

1211
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,609
when you're when you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> strata and</font>

1212
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,618
you're getting angel<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun on you might</font>

00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:14,790
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're raising half a</font>

1217
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:17,250
million to a million dollars it's really

1218
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,900
money from doctors ray or high net worth

1219
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,910
individuals you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> think things like</font>

headline able you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel inside</font>

1223
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,119
investing in tenable um there's a lot of

1224
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:32,459
intangible benefit right the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

1225
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:34,800
in there the media gets inside and

1226
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,920
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a free crutch for you and you're</font>

1227
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming to that that's not a bad thing</font>

1228
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,220
even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you somebody here is in</font>

1229
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,900
the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of adventure race and they're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">getting a you know it's not</font>

1231
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,650
record-setting but it's a million

1232
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:48,089
dollars two million dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you</font>

1233
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,369
there's a lot that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

1234
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:51,630
all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can recruit better because you</font>

1235
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:52,680
know if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it hey come with</font>

1236
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,020
me i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start a company my</font>

1237
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,759
garage at step if you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you</font>

1238
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a government job or a big</font>

1239
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,880
corporation or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

1240
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,950
you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just closed a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two million</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> die</font>

1241
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">odile you might be able to recruit</font>

1242
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,759
better and so there's an added benefits

1243
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,220
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get from from from doing</font>

1244
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:14,849
that kind of stuff very cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRA</font>

1245
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:17,750
question can we do it to questions from

1246
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:17,750
the same person no

1247
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,000
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manage to</font>

1248
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,580
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party risk that's inherent when</font>

1249
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,020
you go to the cloud so you could do it a

1250
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,540
couple of different ways what I what I

1251
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,400
would do is I would want to understand

1252
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,140
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are your requirements for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1253
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,820
organization so if you're a DOD

1254
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,950
contractor there's very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

1255
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:44,360
requirements of what you need to do with

1256
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:47,450
third party providers and you probably

1257
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,980
have third-party providers right now who

1258
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:50,779
maybe not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> beyond the cloud but</font>

1259
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,430
they're sort of penalty vending machines

1260
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,620
things like that so any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those have to</font>

1261
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,899
be kind of complied with but at the same

1262
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,549
time former the IP type stuff for data

1263
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,230
is in motion and you have you know data

1264
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:02,480
that's that's under control of somebody

1265
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,740
else there's a ton of stuff what I would

1266
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,690
tell you is that if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1267
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,729
something along those<font color="#CCCCCC"> line get a pitch</font>

1269
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:13,300
program and compare it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Google pitch</font>

1270
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:15,830
and a rackspace pitch and a amazon pitch

1271
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">microsoft again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't come amount of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">staff searching for Microsoft but</font>

1273
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,060
they've taken the attitude that they're

1274
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,490
late to market and that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1275
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:24,049
certify for everything if you get a

<font color="#E5E5E5">compliant with those complying with that</font>

been kind of their their focus but

1284
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:40,370
that's one really interesting way to do

1285
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,720
that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff so that you have to</font>

1286
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,910
comply with anything you're required to

1287
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,290
do first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might be in a</font>

1288
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:50,379
business where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't outsource in</font>

00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:50,380
some cases solo manager short question

1290
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:17,990
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was if you're a somebody</font>

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,280
interesting on there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1296
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,990
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> startups that are out there</font>

1304
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,450
environment to kind of to kind of work

1305
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,730
with i'm also working with other

1306
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:49,129
startups where the team you know worked

1307
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,660
at like ta air at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA and they've</font>

1308
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,190
gone out and they've started ever now

1309
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,690

1310
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:56,000
who've been working together for five or

1311
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:57,470
six years is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first company but</font>

you know so timing and and capture and

1314
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:03,799
all those kind of things are really

1315
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,150
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1316
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,650
the biggest thing you can do if you're

1317
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,390
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to work for a start-up is</font>

1318
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:09,470
basically just asking now what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1319
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:11,240
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want from me what do you</font>

1320
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:13,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me there's there's all</font>

1321
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,810
sorts of ways you can maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

1322
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,099
situation where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1323
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,650
them come for a while maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

1324
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:20,210
family yet you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> shock and really</font>

1325
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:22,460
admittedly hey maybe you can be our

1326
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:24,230
third founder and so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1327
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,990
ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach that that kind of stuff</font>

1328
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,980
i would i would really suggest you know

1329
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,839
you speak to all the people I've ever

1330
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,300
talked to Rick I talk to anybody who's

1331
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:33,890
done any type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lawyer message they're</font>

1332
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,200
pretty good situations in bad situations

1333
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:38,598
depending on who that is but don't

1334
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,910
expect if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the government you</font>

1335
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:43,310
work for again like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lockheed martin a</font>

1336
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:45,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">array or something like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you should</font>

1337
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:46,930
not expect that going to a startup

1338
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:49,339
company from a salary point of view

1339
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,660
because you put your ad taking a risk so

1340
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:53,480
you should be able to get some equity

1341
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:55,609
some stock and try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that into</font>

1342
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,890
that vision it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question good</font>

1343
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:59,299
question and that's early with you if

1344
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,549
you have a friend who's thinking about

1345
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:04,640
doing it tell them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it the industry</font>

1346
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:07,400
needs more style apps more opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1347
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">really feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that again this is nothing</font>

1348
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,640
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1349
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,200
working with the government will i

1350
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,060
reck'n of the boozing and anything like

1351
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,890
that they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> great work I'm not</font>

1352
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,110
just about two percent of those people

1353
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:18,670
to leave and start companies if we give

1354
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,980
that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have more people</font>

1355
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:23,170
in cyber than like Silicon Valley Health

1356
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,390
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know of anybody thinking</font>
