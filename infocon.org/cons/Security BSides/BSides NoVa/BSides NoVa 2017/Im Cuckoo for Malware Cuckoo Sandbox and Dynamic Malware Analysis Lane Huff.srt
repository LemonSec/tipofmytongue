45
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,430
at static is that's where everything

ain't wrong you know dynamic now from

47
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,980
our house why the viewer feel so let's

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,500
look at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> again out so that alice is</font>

at a file as a tip on your computer you

51

data analysis wanna come through file

64
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,580
metadata so the mine site will give you

65
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:13,079
a cushion of what the file created so

66
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:15,840
today Microsoft oily file is it a PDF

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,440
zip file you kind of gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trigger</font>

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,019
what the power that's how a lot of

69
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,440
programs know how to interact although

70
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:29,519
any pod and sean is very useful a lot of

times<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably read not useful</font>

72
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,580
anymore but that's also can be useful

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">growing out you get files that are same</font>

74
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,060
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they run on system differently</font>

75
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,069
which we'll get into a little bit later

76
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">i get educated I'm going on the route</font>

77
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:48,119
don't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> our version coming an</font>

maybe it's good not a charity case

99
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:55,810
here's an example of a piece of malware

100

that was using sign code registered you

you know I look more into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it's</font>

108
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:20,020
very interesting than ours pretty cool

144
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,990
on that obligated so even though it's

145
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">obvious people they want to leave the</font>

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,199
shining their kind of signature out

147
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:12,680
there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a professional</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">company that uses as legitimate uses but</font>

149
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,560
when you run traded on this you get a

150
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">handful of information showing this part</font>

of li compile this<font color="#E5E5E5"> code but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this came</font>

152
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:29,270
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Osuna season</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over and then here's</font>

153
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,260
an example of net macros that were sent

154
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:37,039
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually got he's in my email</font>

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">play with file and put all the variables</font>

157
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,729
tracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot so what is the program</font>

158
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,770
actually that's what we care about

159
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:53,469
through when we're talking about dynamic

160
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:56,780
analogies so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

161
00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:00,760
dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis so like the top it off</font>

162
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,760
report there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,260
which a lot of people that want to skate

164
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,910
probably use application things like

165
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,130
that so can't help<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all going to do</font>

166
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,750
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually run it all and at</font>

167
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,330
all now we're all just don't want their

168
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,160
call to be easily analyzed because if

169
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:20,210
you get easily analyzers you can easily

170
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">write signatures sure if a date or</font>

171
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,840
anything like that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow your</font>

172
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,520
system to be protected against it a lot

173
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,390
of these guys want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it difficult</font>

174
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:36,530
to catch them during their mouth next

175
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,309
pop so you got some awesome player

176
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,409
talking

177
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,449
doing dynamic it out that you can run on

178
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own how many of you do if i show an</font>

179
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,620
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at malware and first</font>

180
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:50,600
thing you do and choose download a new

181
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:53,330
desktop I don't see any hands up there

182
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,060
how people might soon enough maybe I'm

183
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:59,000
in the wrong pocket if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can run it on</font>

184
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,709
a vm<font color="#CCCCCC"> and or you could run it on i played</font>

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,900
a physical system and all these kind of

186
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">run tools and try to to gather things</font>

187
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,550
off the hard drive afterwards if you

188
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">really wanted to but doing this on one</font>

189
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,219
by one hey it's really difficult it's

190
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,660
going to be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work and up or</font>

191
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,300
something like Cooper come to the place

192
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,510
because conclude sandbox is basically

193
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">this huge platform that allows you to</font>

194
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:27,920
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a handful of virtual machines and</font>

195
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,480
then run run<font color="#E5E5E5"> an application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

196
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,740
trying to analyze and get data back from

197
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,170
your virtual machine you can actually

198
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">even run it on their level but so right</font>

199
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:40,099
now you're talking about the main branch

200
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,230
for windows XP and windows seven and

201
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,230
they also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> babies support for Linux</font>

202
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,820
Android and actually though is that and

203
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,870
then sandbox architectures you can

204
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,730
pretty much use any equal out there that

205
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,370
you can set up the animal<font color="#E5E5E5"> the virtual</font>

206
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,770
box of emrs viglen<font color="#CCCCCC"> kvm and the</font>

207
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:02,000
zephirians you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use very</font>

208
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:05,120
level system what kind of features does

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,640
it have it could do registry and process

210
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,460
and out network analysis memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis</font>

211
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,980
he has volatility and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sauce Colonel</font>

212
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,230
import you can look at and drop files so

213
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,270
John Fowler essentially one<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

214
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,310
runs like you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dollar it</font>

215
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,810
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole one file to your hard</font>

216
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,650
drive that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we call a drop file</font>

217
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:26,989
and then later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and then later you can</font>

218
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:31,100
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> run analysis on those files</font>

219
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are dropped so another thing if we</font>

220
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">even get into setting up your imp a</font>

221
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,420
majestic hair you get a patent

222
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">consideration and play huh really what</font>

223
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:46,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is your goal when you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

224
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:48,290
setting up just so you're just wanting

225
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your own play around get the</font>

226
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,319
technology working a lot or any

227
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,740
we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture so</font>

228
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,130
essentially setting up a vm on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mini</font>

229
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,110
computer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google on it and</font>

230
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,110
then saw on VirtualBox isn't hat and

231
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,240
setting up your windows post enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

232
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,490
over thought that is most you problems

233
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,960
but that are adopting it depends on if

234
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,330
you're trying to hit a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of modern</font>

235
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,860
obligations which you keep with it so

236
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,290
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to limit you to 32 bit</font>

237
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,260
just because of complementation side

238
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:25,689
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on as you can train em</font>

239
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:28,590
64-bit propagator with GM and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the others</font>

240
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,300
read responses we're running these

241
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,880
samples its spitting up shutting down vm

242
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,030
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do a whole lot of</font>

243
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,830
work within that sandbox it really is

244
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,329
limited because again you gotta hold

245
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,070
another operating system or then

246
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,980
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel trying to sit up and</font>

247
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,170
shut down nothin slow down<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might even</font>

248
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,020
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you bad results because the</font>

249
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,910
system's<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching run really slow</font>

250
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:55,600
because you're running a delayed so that

251
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,910
science that's it so if you're looking

252
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,860
on building for like an enterprise or

253
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,660
any other type of environment where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

254
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,490
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a whole bunch of GM you want</font>

255
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,939
to do a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot stuff on you want to</font>

256
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,500
use something like ESX or insert or

257
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,630
something like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

258
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,030
have everything kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a flat</font>

259
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,590
architecture so you'll have cuckoo here

260
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,930
but they can also have the ability to

261
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,730
manage other BM von your system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

262
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,150
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot easier to scale up and</font>

263
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,920
then google<font color="#E5E5E5"> also has the ability to run</font>

264
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">strib you tit so you can actually have</font>

265
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,829
like three or four different<font color="#CCCCCC"> coo coo</font>

266
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines that are doing the proper thing</font>

267
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,080
so you could have 100 p.m. are running

268
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,360
at your now machine and then scale out

269
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,420
there creepy be operating a day for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

270
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,980
report so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line with</font>

271
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,310
this is you get to consider what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

272
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,910
looking for when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to your mouths</font>

273
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,859
and how are you setting up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

274
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,839
enterprise well we brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to a</font>

275
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,260
blast you'd really no other way to do

276
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">unless you're trying to ship it around</font>

277
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,939
containers or otherwise you're gonna be

278
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,810
shooting third come up are you doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

279
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,650
just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> research you know hey it's cool</font>

280
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,849
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could use an episode</font>

281
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,610
architecture and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happy</font>

282
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,800
as much for a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually you might</font>

283
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to graduate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid your lab but</font>

284
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,189
it all depends on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are so</font>

285
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:21,160
I'm to work this is a nice little graph

286
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:24,639
that night it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pretty simple</font>

287
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,610
once you understand see the pathway so

288
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,410
on the left here we have file we want to

289
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:34,870
submit it google it three ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case</font>

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,029
provide for you may opt-out a REST API

292
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,279
utilize and then they have a local

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,109
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our virtual machines so the</font>

297

298
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,860
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those too choosy stuff going on</font>

299
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,560
so touch it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual machine and</font>

300
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it excuse the file and as soon as</font>

that dms up if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set your system</font>

302
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,870
start sniffing all the packets that are

303
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:14,290
coming to and from machine so once the

file is stuff profitable clothes or your

really cool thank you look at computer

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,129
promise you want to use one views in

382
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,960
your sandbox you got to figure it out on

383
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,890
your own because they haven't added any

384
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:50,340

put again your resources are limited

kind of a figure out on your own there

388
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,560
that's the ability to import<font color="#CCCCCC"> and export</font>

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite is work because I know</font>

399
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:29,260
I'm running I'm running the sample and I

400
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,480
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sitting on it so it could</font>

have a lot of using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk in that</font>

404
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:43,540
turn on it and want all tracks a lot

405
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,820
malware now it's starting to encrypt

406
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,700
traffic so it's really hard to read even

407
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,040
if you've got a tap on a lot so this has

408
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,890
support be able to decrypt traffic t

409
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,260
exactly what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

410

malware scoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> sport as well if there's</font>

absolutely terrible like<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

themselves and then then I'm save money

415
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,020
so essentially you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your your</font>

hand wash and it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> your memory</font>

417
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,250
but you can say this is what a normal

418
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,340
run should look like when I'm running

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,679
create deviations from mountains day oh

also might have proper user that has

create an app robots take on that and

479
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,490
you can also install whatever version of

an interesting mean we're talking about

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:05,350
malware so usually a file that's not

trying to evade analysis has a very

552

little entry which means you can see

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a regular file it can be</font>

an indicator that the file does not want

813
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,919
it's still very useful and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

these methods we try true and just so

00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,760
you guys know even if your partner's

example over eating a lot of the other

817
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,020
tools that are out there you're not

818

823
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:46,779
one of the challenge we run into is what

824
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,660
if someone's using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a manual so you</font>

825
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,339
shouldn't thank you so this is an hour

826
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,310
campaign like a ransom or something like

827
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:56,650
that they may not have their manage hold

828
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,930
circuit or more than a month so in that

829
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:02,170
example you wanted to reach out there

830
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:04,419
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in there in one second question</font>

831
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:07,359
is you actually want to reaching out

832
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,910
this some people don't care if it

833
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,410
reaches hours some people do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer to</font>

834
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,700
run everything I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> inoculated</font>

835
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:16,618
environment so I don't have to worry

836
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:21,970
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the keys up joining them</font>

903
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,600
is like the one thing we always see if

904
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,700
you ever see this when you're analyzing

905
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,740
things helping out might be suspicious

906
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:40,149
you know for a fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this is a</font>

you sure top here you notice I use a THC

911
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,839

some other things down here just

921
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:23,390
basically fingerprinting system<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

value oh this meters of signatories of

fingerprinting on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kernel32 and then</font>

931
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:57,230
it shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down Vijay so one thing you do</font>

932
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,200
see when you're looking at this because

933
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:03,140
it tries to reach you<font color="#CCCCCC"> registry keys</font>

934
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,549
nygma perfected enigmas felt so I'd

935
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">never heard of this before so I went</font>

936
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:12,110
digging on the Internet shortly after

937
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:15,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that novice and so what I found was is a</font>

938
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:18,440
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in i guess that</font>

these tax and they have something called

00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,140
as minima protector which they rapid

942
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:30,020
executable and to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen from</font>

943
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:33,830
analyzing their craft so that's what we

944
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:35,320
use here n so if you look so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just more</font>

945
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:39,020
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> ain't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found the developers website</font>

and it simply says text executable room

947
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:44,690
Wow hacking and how the provocation

948
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,450
disassembly they use some weird virtual

949
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:50,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">CPUs other than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the executable and makes</font>

Skywalker's now all

952
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:59,799
so when you have something like this you

953
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:04,839
know are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you spend a lot of time trying</font>

to analyze the customize your vm and
