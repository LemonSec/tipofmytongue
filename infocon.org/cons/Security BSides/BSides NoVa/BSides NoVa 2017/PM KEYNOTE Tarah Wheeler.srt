<font color="#E5E5E5">adhesive is my wallpaper now and try to</font>

48
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,660
live up to it most of the time I grew up

49
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,880
on a farm in flourish in Oregon lots of

50
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,200
courses and I love horses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll talk</font>

51
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit more about courses later on</font>

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,200
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're doubly cyber security</font>

53
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,440
related example on that farm I got a

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,790
chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> poke around an awful lot with</font>

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,290
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of machines about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 14 on left</font>

56
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,280
the farm instead of building computers

57
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,650
because there were like ticks all

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,940
purples I mean I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty</font>

59
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,790
awesome and for those of you who have

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,800
ever had to fight between ide and fuzzy

61
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,739
connectors and jumpers on a motherboard

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,090
there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there's my people and there</font>

63
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,900
was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun right but I don't think</font>

64
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really then thought about making</font>

65
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,280
information technology in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> future I</font>

66
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,980
was allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build the machines on but</font>

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,510
I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it was just proceed but</font>

68
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,280
I would go and kid you know cortical

69
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,959
science or math or something like that

70
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,790
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was more suited for girls</font>

71
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:17,730
oddly enough so I did exactly that I

72
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,209
went and spent some time learning how to

73
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,100
speak in public and I did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,600
debate forensics anybody in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here doing</font>

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">speech and debate in high school and</font>

76
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,739
college a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun right trust me it</font>

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,299
is useful in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any career path ever I also</font>

78
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,910
spent some time at Portland State

79
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,250
University of Michigan doing about a

80
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,549
record of what could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered the</font>

by delaying conversational simulation

84
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,850
and that para got my tech skills it also

85
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,430
has informed a lot of the world that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

86
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,170
think about technology from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

87
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,580
until today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to bring some</font>

88
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,040
stuff in that we simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

89
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,940
about server security in a larger

a couple of examples i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

that stacks of cash he doesn't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,650
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the job what's the thing we</font>

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,050
when I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about financial security</font>

184
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,940
when I think about transaction I think

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,190
about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> constant quest by information</font>

whatever leak they leak metadata right

196
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,830
the way that we track and trace money

197

has become an unbelievably huge if<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

things and make flashy headlines but

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,830
often we don't dig down into the dirty

securely and privately most of the time

214
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,320
we just focus on to securely and don't

pay as much attention to the privately

right there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem as those</font>

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,459
are the people that are telling us how

we can and<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't for money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what the</font>

256
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,610
in three releasable ways is that

<font color="#E5E5E5">government can control only two out of</font>

three things at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time one is capital</font>

259
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,240
flows amount of money that can come in

control their monetary policy internal

interest rates often related a fiscal

266
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,190
policy so that makes sense in most in

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,650
most free unplanned<font color="#E5E5E5"> economies those</font>

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,120
policy and they let the exchange rate go

271
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,130

<font color="#E5E5E5">think that is does anybody have an</font>

right now the transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an</font>

434
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,760
frankly already here right it would be

435
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,890
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate at this point to not think</font>

to happen to them in the matter of less

than three years likely let's think

442
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,240
about the fact that the people who are

00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:55,400
instead auto mechanics look a little bit

because there are sharing things in the

541
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,600
it's awesome and yet we have to stop and

542
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,020
remember that everything has an

one to hurt and moving from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there with</font>

568
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,530
mitigation with remediation which

569
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:57,230
respected and with my god with humility

570
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,700
is how we create lasting change in the

571
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,380
world that takes the awesomest that's

572
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,630
inside us<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the jury in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this community</font>

useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent helpful sense and innovative</font>

575
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,178
sense and a respectful sense for the

576
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,650
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have the</font>

577
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:12,230
opportunities that the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which</font>

578
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,610
room had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> join</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an awesome industry</font>

579
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,200
full of people that are creative and

580
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:19,129
beautiful and interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unique</font>

581
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,169
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> day this notion of humility</font>

582
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,659
and community is was going to build a

583
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:26,059
future that is far greater than any rock

584
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:28,250
star could ever understand that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

585
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:30,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">for we take joy in breaking things apart</font>

586
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:35,299
and getting dirty<font color="#CCCCCC"> in building</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

587
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:36,650
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day and I suppose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

588
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:39,190
thing i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express is just how</font>

589
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,390
grateful I am can you standing here the

590
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,250
stickers on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop say where I've</font>

591
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,799
been and a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I shouldn't</font>

592
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,980
have been definitely inside the laptop

593
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I want to express my gratitude to</font>

594
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,169
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room for listening to</font>

595
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,000
me for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinking and for hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

596
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:58,340
these lessons back to each of your

597
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,380
individual communities and remembering

598
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,178
that behind every innovation is a

599
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">lonesome pail of people who are going to</font>

600
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,740
get left behind come to think of it that

601
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds like a fairly good target for</font>

602
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,650
some disruption no

603
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,650
[Music]

604
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,220

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,810
[Applause]

606
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,160
yes what about some questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

607
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:27,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get started happening sometime</font>

608
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,470
reasonably soon so i will first I'll

609
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,639
supposed to take questions from<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks</font>

610
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room and I think</font>

611
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,490
there's somebody who is mediating and

612
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,520
moderating questions online who's going

613
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,200
to throw them out at me so that or maybe

614
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,430
somebody looks at Twitter and follows

615
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,839
them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay question</font>

616
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,839
[Music]

617
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,949
there's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question because</font>

618
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,420
that's part of what lives in the back of

619
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,130
my head right now is the creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

620
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,860
ethical framework that can be drilled

621
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,480
down into a right action into a binary

622
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,760
essentially when it comes to a decision

623
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,360
and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want to load down</font>

624
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,300
every single keystroke with the depth of

625
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,580
an ethical decision or or consequence or

626
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,470
were worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> than people who you know want</font>

627
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,750
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to code comment on everything I mean</font>

628
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:45,350
those people are friggin tyrants right

629
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:48,170
so the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would ask is not</font>

630
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily can i impart to you know the</font>

631
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,990
ethical framework for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry or</font>

632
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,090
the piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry which you're</font>

633
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,850
in but can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take an overarching</font>

634
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,379
concern for the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are typically</font>

635
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,699
the ones who already we left me find out

636
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,350
the innovation is going to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

637
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,670
build<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own framework for what you</font>

638
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,050
think is responsible treatment of those

639
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,610
people the answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be very</font>

640
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,310
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the auto industry in the</font>

641
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,110
financial industry in the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

642
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:11,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sharing economy visibility better</font>

643
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,860
put it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> frequently</font>

644
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,080
hurt by the sharing economy are the

645
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,120
people at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> margins</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of every economy</font>

646
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,710
which is how you see then the profound

647
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,199
home of his problem in san francisco

648
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">right because one can have driven the</font>

649
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,790
marginal utility<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having a local</font>

650
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,580
service provider in to almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing as</font>

651
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:31,100
compared to the economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scale that a</font>

652
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,620
large provider like Airbnb at 2.4

653
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,179
million hotel rooms and provide you see

654
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,550
that a small service provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> is driven</font>

655
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,800
into into nothingness the question then

656
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:41,480
is there are some industries that have

657
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:46,040
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fatter tale of people left</font>

658
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind the car and hotel industries are</font>

659
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,730
probably the two biggest ones because

660
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,370
those are large huge portions of

661
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,530
providers in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

662
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,560
so i would say the first question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

663
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,760
what entry and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people can be</font>

664
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,980
affected by it and second of all are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

665
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,330
third what is the framework that you

666
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,730
think you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create to protect the</font>

667
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,669
people in my tale of disruption make

668
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,560
sense

669
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,090
okay you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to create it yourself the</font>

670
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,409
question is are you at least thinking

671
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,389
about it we can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we got in</font>

672
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,370
some place right the pareto-optimal

673
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">effects which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i fairly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure so much</font>

674
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:57,540
screaming internally hear you say all

675
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:59,159
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that is a wonderful question</font>

676
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,800
and oddly i'm going to relate it to

677
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,320
finance as well or at least internet

678
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,060
infrastructure I've seen and played a

679
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,580
pension to the Senators and innovations

680
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,440
you're talking about in in the medical

681
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,460
profession as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the different</font>

682
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,260
paying attention to things like HIPAA

683
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,690
disclosures and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

684
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,060
also the advent of AI and robotics in

685
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,680
the medical industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a really</font>

686
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one and the reason I've</font>

687
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,340
noticed this is I pay attention also to

688
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,550
gender-based breakdowns of prestigious

689
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,530
careers as more women have joined the

690
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,330
medical industry the prestige<font color="#E5E5E5"> in pay of</font>

691
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,830
that industry has dropped interestingly

692
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,270
that's not true for hospital

693
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,550
administrators who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are like ninety-eight</font>

694
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,530
percent white men<font color="#CCCCCC"> and anyone who's on</font>

695
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:41,399
the cutting edge of research like AI and

696
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:44,100
like robotic so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm going</font>

697
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to relate to his note that just as in</font>

698
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,879
with auto mechanics essentially needing

699
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,980
to become diagnostic technician and

700
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,050
computer sciences because the car is a

701
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer right so does the thing you</font>

702
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:58,080
know it runs it will it can add now it

703
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,700
was the one when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in today's quota</font>

704
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">not a computer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physical way off track</font>

705
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,250
but they had computer bad but the thing

706
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would note is that the first closely</font>

707
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,690
related Iceland to the word that mobile

708
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,980
infrastructure in Africa has recently

709
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,460
been developing where instead of

710
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">dropping cables into the ground</font>

711
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,500

noticed that that is a wonderful

the unique capacity in cyber security

872
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,789
because we have a negative unemployment

who aren't cyber security specialists

a call to action but also put yourself
