title overview of a pen test methodology

57
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,930
this is the one we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give our</font>

58
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,970
customers because of the two main points

allowing teach you but customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

60
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,840
come pretend that they can bring the

61
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,700
tool bonus right so let's break out our

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,080
methodology automated testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manual</font>

63
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,238
testings we actually show them hey

64
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,370
there's a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just rating tool</font>

65
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,410
and we makin that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nail testing piece so</font>

66
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,970
come justify you know the hours you're

67
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">presenting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that project and let them</font>

68
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that there's a lot more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than just</font>

69
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,140
click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next hand button and then</font>

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,940
it's also important to do the planning

71
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,619
scope and get any gauge read something

72
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,299
where you know we have customer comes up

73
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say and Tessa so you can find out</font>

74
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,170
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hackers got in and likely be</font>

75
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,299
there like we already have to Michael we

76
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,040
need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something a moment reduces</font>

77
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,390
and response work but it's important to

78
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,010
understand like my turn up don't want to

79
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,029
do that assessment as you might actually

80
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,920
all the different service but so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

81
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one page or how to go beyond and I</font>

82
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,309
said when we quita liberation in this

83
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,859
talk we actually talking arm on a

84

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,150
out the deeper level but the whole

mindset ear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> schools that are kind of</font>

87
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,500
new to end testing is good a whole lot

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,940
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> gears disease of your gauge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail</font>

fail a lot but I don't give up I'm

92
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,030
persistent so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an advanced</font>

100
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,079
bit but you know if you want it you

101
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,909
learn to grow beyond that you start to

102

105
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,099
from recon mapping basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding the</font>

113
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,169
lovely like these tools just knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to run method again</font>

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,030
some whether the patient per se it's

117
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">more not to get the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I grateful to</font>

118
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,599
that there are other tools for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font>

119
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,758
of thing so just knowing what's will be

120
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,289
used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the job is important in the</font>

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,910
manual setting piece of us enjoyed that

122
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,440
be like we need my name is testing I'd

123
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,960
say well I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is identify</font>

124
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,900
all the areas of user input and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,239
above them and try to also miss you the

126
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,739
technology features especially if you

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,960
take on features what that means that

128
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,180
the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> lapiz upload a file for</font>

avatar while the threshold who is right

130
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,659
so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to misuse the feature</font>

131
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,550
and then i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to buy all the</font>

132
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:49,680
findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> with false positive stuff so</font>

133
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,590
it's all stuff that you know necessarily

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sydney look for per se and then the</font>

135
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,520
other important thing here is highlight

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,659
business in half so your channels don't

137
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,070
do their job at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they don't</font>

138
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:01,919
understand the Esper's business so we've

139
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,050
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers that availability came to</font>

140
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,198
them it's just been goes offline I'm

141
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,000
losing a lot of money per hour so I find

142
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,530
it an alternative for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability that's any</font>

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,330

learn if you have confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

145
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,020
so you can kind of related back to

149
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:26,210
so fishing I'm sure there's no surprise

150
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,200
that this actually works you know

151
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,510
organizations that differ level success

152
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,370
you can wear from like seven percent to

our fishing engagements usually closer

155
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,120
to the forty percent but if you're done

156
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">efficient engagement they've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a part</font>

right so the goals and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rules needy</font>

166
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,409
because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing is always</font>

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,309
still a good good point there and what

174
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,350
we like to do is also determine the

175
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,060
scenarios we generally do two types of

176
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,970

a pretty hardened external site we're

00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,670
and as you can see my side here just had

401
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,920
a point 13 right and you see a brokerage

up almost the debug a PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay whatever</font>

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,930
is the own speech because you can't you

406
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,880
see the source code check and see much I

407
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,709
can have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole lot to go on here but</font>

this you know resource Jason in English

410
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:33,620
so I'm the next thing I'm going to do is

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:37,160
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do is actually um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> altima</font>

413
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,670
on this particular resource so I'm

414
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,649
actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to buzz get</font>

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,750
supply input of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the few something to</font>

417
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,490
that input I was doing that was def

418
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,680
process and it was thinking well

419
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,300
actually the boy to lunch and coming

567
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,799
see it like going on but we can

568
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,990
essentially grab these authentic even

569

571
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">really bad but depending on that you can</font>

572
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,380
either do password cracking and have to

573
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,120
access being easy gold you could do this

574
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,460
relay attack and get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a little</font>

575
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,709
bit especially in either you can relate

576
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,140
out of protocol past a hot potato which

577
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,970
is a great thing from la fox club they

578
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically said that you could take the</font>

589
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,550
that it's in a config file so you can

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,560
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on and off as very unique and</font>

591
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,750
that's part isn't you running this tool

592
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,340
it's logging a lot of the things that's

593
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,920
going on so it's good bring it to

609
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,899
different things of versioning this is

610
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,920
the same type of thing but what is going

611
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is it's actually doing that</font>

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,300
poisoning for the hell of an arm it's

613
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,850
seeing the LM in our traffic as being

614
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,010
that bio strategies and let's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

615
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,080
to fingerprint what's the OS going on

616
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,330
you know so we see you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seven</font>

617
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,399

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,230
getting the ones information and we

619
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,060
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see poisons working we're</font>

getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> all set occasion of temps right</font>

with the cash and<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling be too though</font>

623
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,129
so the second you say that kind of

624
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,020
touched on briefly but that w hat we

625
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,150
want actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can make it</font>

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of area or unweighted we could do</font>

that has the auto-destruct read features

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,000
enable essentially we could do the

switch pw which we start that w pad

632
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,960
server that malicious service in a DAT

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,260
have a sec record off the w pad instance

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,550
so then up see you all there we're going

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,409
to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's up send us your traffic but</font>

so thanks very much and it's all is it

00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:06,460
look into this and just see is the

couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways you can prevent it</font>

659
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,500
first of all you can disable the broad

there they definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped your</font>

make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> w cut violence redeem at that</font>

668

article as well with hot potato they

670
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,440
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can plug the context and</font>

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,450
you know then<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically if you're if you</font>

673
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,640
on the so we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to basically go</font>

674

<font color="#E5E5E5">to that so it can be bypassed but that</font>

675
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,740
is a good practice as well to do the w

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,009
hand with that and we need you<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">environment for 15 character pastors</font>

707
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,969
wrong you know you know it's in the

708
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:24,940
garage around a little easier when I

709
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:26,769
would shoot<font color="#E5E5E5"> up 60 yeah and we make all</font>

710
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,329
of that in this later but I definitely

711
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,159
think that you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> try this where</font>

712
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:31,178
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> about to go over it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help with</font>

713
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,190
the beach you want to preserve

714
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,529
definitely a much more harder thing to

715
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,619
crack then we can definitely relate your

716
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:41,919
past year so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately is that this</font>

717
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:45,189
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is a relay from the netbios</font>

718
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,070
multitasking as we wouldn't enjoy that

719
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:50,139
so essentially once we insert ourselves

720
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,908
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> between this engine I'm</font>

722
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:58,389

723
00:25:54,749 --> 00:26:00,339
uterine hatch so what we start that we

724
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:02,918
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage essentially like a</font>

726
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,999
that and this initiation can occur over

727
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:10,119
that multicast with me that we did

728
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:12,879
earlier with LOL in RM netbios also we

729
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,619
can see potentially automated processes

730
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:16,899
attempting to authenticate a problem

731
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:18,428
network so that also happens to and the

732
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:19,958
speed is a lot of cash management<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

antivirus or abilities can turn

00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:24,459
something scripts do and what's

735
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,950
happening is you're trying to login /

736
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:29,200
SME and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it from a domain</font>

737
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,879

<font color="#CCCCCC">I want to run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and then just you</font>

share their math well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing</font>

742
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,960
is you're sending these credits across

743
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,919
the network and it's malicious you know

744
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,840
if you're running like something like

745

responder or you're running this has to

746
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,379
be related to what we're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">things but you're essentially going to</font>

782
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:09,920
be really cool what we can do is we can

783
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:12,350
actually see this authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> temp</font>

784
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it is made to our box on the local</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it a good pan and</font>

00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:25,220
and then relay and login so I

790
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,840
essentially like came into the middle

00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:05,500
also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the time so any you</font>

real quick an invalid tempest actually

985
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,319
look like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the response</font>

986
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:14,920
to touch it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that user registration</font>

987
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:16,869
this is kind of hard does it look that's

988
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,730
how already bit so we can you try rest

989
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,700
your mom one and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably good</font>

991
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:26,680
there's now Bob one is real this will

992
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:28,329
tell you if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough yeah various</font>

993
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,519
error messages look for these error

994
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:32,880
messages summer more verbose and others

995
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:35,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll look at this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that source code</font>

996
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,150
also look if there's any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of web</font>

999
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:46,180
everything is going on there and do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1000
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:47,799
source google hacking Oh said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1001
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,210
to talk about this / days but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1002
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:50,009
time

1003
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,300
things you can do with that but

1004
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes the application just flat-out</font>

1005
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,440
tells you<font color="#CCCCCC"> username I did with the PHP</font>

1006
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,670
bulletin for example shows you the last

1007
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,790

1008
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:02,430
corner right so check your<font color="#E5E5E5"> account name</font>

1009
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:06,000
gather your username you can essentially

1010
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:08,700
build it<font color="#E5E5E5"> puts up the automation control</font>

1011
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,440
so essentially you got those<font color="#E5E5E5"> usernames</font>

1012
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,080
right now you're going to try and brute

1013
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,690
force them it's in and see it through

1014
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,520
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing in play so I I only</font>

1015
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,800
want you burp with any web application

1016
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,200
pen set it is essentially likely go to

1017
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,690
cool but you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull up that</font>

1018
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,069
request to say in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Perth and then you</font>

1019
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">could use repeater and you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1020
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">try that off one account that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knows</font>

1021
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,410
about user and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're gonna try it reply</font>

1022

1023
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,950
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you see after ten tries</font>

1024
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,960
there's no difference response you're

1025
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,460
not getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lock out or anything it's</font>

1026
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,280
like brute force probably on the table

1027
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,530
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just for Peter request</font>

1028
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,010
to intruder we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> automate this right</font>

1029
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,300
so there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> mock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out essentially we</font>

1030
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,800
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep knocking on the door</font>

1031
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,480
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use your computer to do that</font>

1032
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,460
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how to lift up there if</font>

1033
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,060
you like except<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all these different</font>

what i was trying to present there is if

1088
