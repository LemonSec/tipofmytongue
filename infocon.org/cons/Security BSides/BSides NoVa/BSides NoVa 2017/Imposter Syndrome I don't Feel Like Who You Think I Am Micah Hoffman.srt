16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,280
his field yeah okay pretty smart nerd

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:03,030
has any comparison with and this guy is

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,890
the iconic version of what a physicist

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,430
is right if you look at physicist on

20
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,700
Wikipedia as we do picture shows up

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,310
there hi Rachel this is wow that doom

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,729
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that wasn't supposed to</font>

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,659
happen let's go back right so his

24
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:24,990
picture shows up and yet how<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

25
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:29,119
Einstein thought that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are making</font>

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,710
too much of his<font color="#CCCCCC"> work he thought that</font>

27
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,820
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are taking what he made his</font>

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,740
simple ideas his formula with his<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font>

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,559
and they're burning up and it made<font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,289
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fraud made him feel like an</font>

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,640
deGrasse Tyson yep astrophysicist

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,780
extraordinaire amazing i he he talked a

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,930
little bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font>

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,270
Einstein this guy who doesn't feel like

37
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,219
he really contributed that much to the

38
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,420
world that we wouldn't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us a</font>

39
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,789
little about some of the things that

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,590
aren't predicted or worked out the math

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,800
for 50<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 60 years</font>

42
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,160
before we could prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> so regardless of</font>

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,690
what objectively know about Einstein we

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,319
know that he felt at the fraud we know

45
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:24,370
that he couldn't internalize the

46
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,190
feelings of success that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public that</font>

47
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:31,739
his peers and that other people were

48
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:35,349
showering upon him just didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel it</font>

49
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,420
the reason was that his subjective

50
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,670
perception of what the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant</font>

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,440
were with his contributions were just

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,480
society were we're not reflected<font color="#CCCCCC"> in what</font>

53

the objective Vietnam sorry he didn't

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,790
have an objective view of rest of the

55
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">contributions were ok so objectively</font>

56
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,069
people think that's amazing stuff that's

57
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,049
that decades ahead and yeah when he

58
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,149
heard the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word when he heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

success to him personally to his brain

62
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:13,720
to what he built this is impostor

78
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,340
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like wow that was really clear I</font>

79
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,250
started thinking about what a word

80
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,870
contribution to information security you

81
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,639
know if I was to get up there when

82
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,980
people say about me well people even

83
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,160
walk back to my talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about well yeah</font>

84
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,829
let me think about that

85
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,440
you know it at that time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had no old</font>

86
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,600
day exploits to write a the PowerShell

87
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,750
module about it or to write in

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">incorporating to metasploit I couldn't</font>

89
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:26,230
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> write powershell or Python or Ruby</font>

90
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,590
or pearl you know it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy right</font>

91
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,000
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> dude any of that stuff and so I</font>

92
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,830
started thinking about myself I said

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">well what are you like good at what</font>

94
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:43,030
could I do well I just test rub out I

95
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:45,430
just test web<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps now I teach how to</font>

96
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,169
hack web applications now I teach her

97
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,180
sans institute can we might have heard

98
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:53,620
of it I teach<font color="#E5E5E5"> that look back in 2012 I</font>

99
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,290
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really anything</font>

100
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to compare with what Chris gate and Rob</font>

101
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:02,440
filler and HD Moore did and so I went

102
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,510
home and after analyzing what I

103
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,690
personally was doing to contribute to

104
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:11,320
information security<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

105
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:14,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">other jobs outside of the field now at</font>

106
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,080
this point I had been any information

107
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:22,150
security for about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years back hacking</font>

108
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,250
defending if you're responding you know

109
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">other things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I love doing I'd love</font>

110
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,350
doing them so when I started comparing

111
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,669
myself to other people and ignoring the

112
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:37,000
successes that I had personally my

113
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,580
contributions were insignificant and so

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,980
I look for other work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know there's</font>

115
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,440
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the work I listen to podcast</font>

116
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,360
if I know I was kind of played with what

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,880
i was doing after hours and I was losing

118
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,290
a podcast enough I remember are just

119
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">learning the background</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard these</font>

120
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:57,520
two words<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor syndrome wow what I</font>

121
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,770
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> imposter is I know what syndrome is</font>

122
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,349
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them together that that sounds</font>

123
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">like something that might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting</font>

124
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,300
and that's when I started learning about

125
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impostor syndrome because things</font>

126
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,100
started to make sense the behaviors that

127
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,640
I found people with impostor syndrome

128
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">have I saw myself and explained a lot of</font>

129
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,060
the activities they explained a lot of

130
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:24,469
how I related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the room in hell</font>

the world the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about imposter</font>

132
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,160
syndrome is a gnarly syndrome it's not

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,489
recognized<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the American Psychological</font>

and the impact rescinded cyclist is one

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">those very simple to describe we started</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with lower left shit i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comparing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

298
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,640
the top the project is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in a</font>

299
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,979
disaster this is that negative self-talk

300
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,590
this is that lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> self confidence in</font>

301
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,170
your spoke with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're comparing it to</font>

302
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,570
other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know how the hell can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

303
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:04,199
make something that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

304
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,740
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some how are you mother</font>

305
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,190
through it somehow you get it done

306
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,990
you're like hey I did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> who oh crap</font>

307
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,640
I've got another project to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in this</font>

308
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,980
cycle keeps going no this is a

309
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,230
simplified version in one of the papers

310
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,660
that I was reviewing for this talk I

311
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,760
found a more complicated one and this I

312
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,069
still hit some very important pieces of

313
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,840
imposter syndrome if we started the top

314
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,680
again we had that shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a project</font>

315
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do right the achievement related task</font>

316
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,219
from a human related past there's

317
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,219
growing so many values<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be some</font>

318
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Titans left out some worrying from some</font>

319
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">anxiety insider you have to create</font>

320
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that nobody else is done that</font>

321
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,050
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be teaching people that</font>

322
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,780
are experts how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have PhDs in</font>

323
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,760
psychology well what I'm breaking the

324
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,470
top I what if there's a PhD in

325
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,490
psychology out there looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

326
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:59,260
among other things I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so you</font>

327
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,440
have this anxiety never sell stop this

328
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:05,020
worry but somehow managed to get the

329
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,300
project done right you may be will over

330
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,730
prepare for it you will work really very

331
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,849
hard this is the perfectionist syndrome

332
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,890
write me i will put ours you know you

333
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:19,540

334
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:21,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">what want to put on these rides yeah</font>

335
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,439
it's hard cuz i was worried that's

336
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">always what if it's not read a letter</font>

337
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,210
fits it's not big enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> or and there's</font>

338
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:34,180
not enough space in between so I was

339
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:36,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">prepared ready how many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

340
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,900
heard of those people that create talks

341
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,670
and they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right my talks in</font>

342
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,740
five minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just finishing up the</font>

343
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,240
slides right I'm just yeah that's a

344
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,460
common thing of these conferences there

345
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,410
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> philly in the back putting</font>

346
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,720
the last news on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> side or whatever</font>

347
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,730
on till we also have this

348
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,280
procrastination thing which aren't great

349
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:57,760
at i'm a master of procrastination I

350
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,160
know all the tricks but here I was very

351
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,439
do my procrastination so now I get the

352
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,060
work done now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens is I stand up</font>

353
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,070
in front of all you and I talked about

354
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the posture syndrome and then after a</font>

355
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,820
similar will come out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay great</font>

356
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,100
talk I really learned something about it

357
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,230
and I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that success</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got that ok I</font>

358
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:18,190
reached one person that that was hurtful

359
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,720
and I'm happy the problem is that would

360
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,030
that positive feedback I don't

361
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,100
attributed truly making a stop standing

362
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,740
in front of you learnt and helping you

363
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,960
learn about<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor feelings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

364
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,820
say well that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was those because i</font>

365
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,770
overplayed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I was</font>

366
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,260
really hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that point is</font>

367
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:37,270
good and for next time I have to work

368
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,790
even harder to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

369
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,110
is working right well I'll so well you

370
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,400
know I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of weird together at</font>

371
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,570
the last minute I'm glad something

372
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,760
resonated with you

373
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:50,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what I see now tributes a lot</font>

374
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,610
now because I've deferred that<font color="#CCCCCC"> success</font>

375
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:56,710
when happened with the next time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

376
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,870
faces way to talk or give a speech<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth</font>

377
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,730
or do something I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

378
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,220
internalized hey I did pretty low on

379
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,020
that last talked let me just amplify

380
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,370
that I look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this unlikely what can I</font>

381
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,949
make better what could I do that because

382
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:11,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">since I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this version list</font>

383
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,030
next version<font color="#CCCCCC"> even better and that then</font>

384
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:17,140
starts the achievement and related tab

385
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:19,599
and you get it because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

386
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">imposter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> syndrome or imposter feeling is</font>

387
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,780
that you both have a fear of success and

388
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">a fear of failure we cover the sides of</font>

389
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,870
that issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> here success because that</font>

390
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,149
success won't be mine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be earned</font>

391
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:39,040
my fear affair because if I didn't try

392
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:41,020
hard enough then I fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> no delays you</font>

393
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,270
there heard my other top you know that

394
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to fail to succeed you have to</font>

395
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,160
fail to learn well you don't learn to

396
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,110
fit me is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone along the fence</font>

397
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,300
yes necessary to be able to learn

398
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,399
because that's how we grow by doing

399
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,919
things wrong right I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> who was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

400
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said hey I didn't know Edison I</font>

401
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,950
think said I'll just I'll just say it to

402
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,460
Edison on Edison said that you know hey

403
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,350
I didn't find 20 ways not to make this

404
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:20,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">work I found threaten well what did he</font>

405
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:22,600
say there you go so Edison said I didn't

406
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,840
find one way to make this bill work I

407
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,919
found 10,000 ways that it didn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

408
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,409
so you have to try but because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

409
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,060
apostrophe you might not it because of

410
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that anxiety because of that start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

411
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,370
does that work and you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

412
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:43,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">might also not try when there's public</font>

413
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,739
scrutiny a publishing codes to github is

414
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,850
something that people have imposter

415
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">feeling dread because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

416
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,449
people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my functions aren't</font>

417
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,480
named right<font color="#E5E5E5"> weather let us know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

418
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cold wrong so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they won't do it we</font>

419
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,830
will give talks we will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and put</font>

420
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,960
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

421
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,520
that's where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and at this point</font>

422
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,130
your presentation you might be asking

423
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,520
yourself is do why I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> imposter</font>

424
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:10,730
syndrome and particularly and it boils

425
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,010
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to two questions one do you feel</font>

426
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,940
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fraud sometimes in certain</font>

427
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:20,060
situations and June if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get honest</font>

428
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,920
feedback about your success<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,959
a hundred people in the audience take

perfect we put people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a pedestal and</font>

575
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,129
then we attribute a lot of these factors

581
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:59,640
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was worth in this talk on for</font>

582
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,840

588
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:15,500
of course but um working for something

589
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,270
is good enough and then here since our

590
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,640
perception of reality is really cute

591
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,289
good objective feedback say to somebody

592
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,270

was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you know i just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> typed</font>

605
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:58,650
in imposter syndrome to youtube and i

606
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:02,760
found Nicholas's 2013 where's conference

607
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,919
video and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was watching it on oh my god</font>

00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,690
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact video that i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

609
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,730
give it gives the same numbers that i

610
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,480
dress research oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god i suppose is</font>

611
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,480
better than mine

612
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:20,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gruber girl so I could you see his his</font>

613
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,950
version of this talk but um he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

614
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:24,410
really nice thoughts in there including

615
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,309
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also suffers from more</font>

616
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:31,340
work to it deals with<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor feeling</font>

617
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:35,570
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nicholas ended his talk by talking</font>

618
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:38,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">about um how in people with impostor</font>

619
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:41,360
feeling essentially will probably always

620
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,850
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an imposter but what they can</font>

621
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,939
do is maybe they can become high

622
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:48,740
functioning imposters in their online

623
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,500
seriously I know it's kind of funny to

624
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:55,580
say that well that's kind of where I

625
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:57,980
strive to to work for to be at to become

626
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,199
a high-functioning imposter so with that

627
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,870
I give you some resources that's a link

when you go to if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to DEFCON or</font>

you were to attend you sitting with

645

646
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,530
thing you wouldn't participate you

647

00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:39,980
those people now what's happening is

649
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,899
with I think the great things about how

650
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,570
do I reach wonderful local community

651
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,190
conferences is that it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people</font>

652
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,889
the opportunity to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a smaller</font>

653
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:51,890
crowd to do things like in you things

654
