interviews and podcasts and things like

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,900
that because I tasted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blood of</font>

23
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,658
security and I wanted some more so so

27
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,540
networking with people not stacks and

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,900
not stacked with people because that's

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,150
the name of my band so I just kind of

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,030

39
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,470

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,048
weird lady who like to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

45
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,068
said hey security is my quirky hobby

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,869

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,049
educated him<font color="#E5E5E5"> security awareness month</font>

52
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,560
and I had this five-point plan all ready

53
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:28,640
to go and I sent it to him and the

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,980
response was I like all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're</font>

doing all of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're in charge so</font>

56
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,140

57
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IT department and we ran this</font>

58
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,619
five-week long because that that year

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,900
October had five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> five fridays i did</font>

61
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,040
graphics park and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not my forte</font>

62
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,929
but I supplied the quotes and the data

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the statistics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the information</font>

64

<font color="#E5E5E5">and the vocabulary and somebody made it</font>

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,459
look pretty and we educated the firm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

66
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,290
that's what I did and I had cool things

67
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,840
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know fishing and spearfishing</font>

68
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,150

75
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,820
that's kind of how I got here today<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

76
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,768
<font color="#CCCCCC">was like yeah I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take things into</font>

77
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,870
my own hands so that's when I started

78
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:26,510
the process of<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

79
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,810
out something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else my own company came</font>

80
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,070
about and yeah so that's kind of how I

81
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,500
him say so I feel it does that give me

82
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,650
some street cred yes no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

83
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,810
all right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here to talk to you</font>

84
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,209
about networking as a professional skill

85
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,519
believe it or not I've had many people

86
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,310
argue with me about networking they will

87
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,350
angrily yes angrily say to me I don't

88
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,079
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network it's not part of my job</font>

89
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:55,340
description or networking is so slimy

90
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:57,350
and underhanded or I can't network i'm

91
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,930
an introvert does any of that sound

92
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,910
familiar resonate with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see some</font>

93
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,310
nodding the head so what I like to do

94
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,320
with our time here today is to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

95
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,250
through examples from my experience is

96
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,769
how you yes you miss intend get on board

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,230
the networking train or if you're

98
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:17,600
already on board how you can refine it

99
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,279
and take it to a new level so my

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,020
presentation is basically divided into

101
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,818
two parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> one how networking with</font>

102
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,190
humans I feel like I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

103
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:30,370
distinguishing that with humans is a

104
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,870
skill that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be learned and honed you</font>

105
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,110
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> also was a skill that you</font>

106
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,330
already learned in howand coding<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it</font>

107
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,270
is a skill to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be learned and honed</font>

108
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,039
second I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with you my ideas</font>

109
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,139
of how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take those networking</font>

110
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,719
skills combined them with an

111
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,270
intrapreneur 'i'll spirit<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll explain</font>

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,860
that later to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a culture of</font>

113
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:56,080
security ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright do any bike</font>

114
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,289
riders in here raise your hand bike

115
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,690
riders<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright bike riders you know if</font>

116
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:04,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it to be a fun in you know</font>

117
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,719
casual activity right not a big deal

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> October 2015 marks a</font>

119
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,360
momentous occasion in my life what was

120
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,680
the occasion that i wrote a bike<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

121
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,659
bike path alongside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pacific ocean</font>

122
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,389
could you see for me expressions like

123
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:24,430
it's like riding a bike doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

124
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:28,659
resonate with me as it does for other

125
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:31,719
people I'm terrified of bike riding like

126
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:34,599
legit terrified like almost as much of

127
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:36,159
clowns like you know my clown<font color="#CCCCCC"> fears</font>

128
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty high bike riding is like just</font>

129
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:41,710
right below it the thought of it gets me

130
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">very anxious I get nervous and I got</font>

131
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,250
symptoms like increased heart rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

132
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,090
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is before the exercise</font>

133
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,500
part that's before pedaling I am a wreck

134
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,130
you know I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this overwhelming sense</font>

135
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,020
of dread and anxiety now people tell me

136
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is how they feel when they're faced</font>

137
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,440
with a networking situation or how they

138
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:04,000
feel about networking so a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

139
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,259
I had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> realization that it was you</font>

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">know honestly it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning to get a</font>

141
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:09,490
little ridiculous for me to have this

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,060
extreme adverse reaction to bike riding

143
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,740
and I set out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

144
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,949
so I mentally broke it down to

145
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:21,130
essentially what it is it is a skill to

146
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">be learned and honed and I set out to</font>

147
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,229
slay this to wield dragon by working up

148
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,719
the courage to rent a bike whenever I

149
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,729
could now sometimes i had my husband

150
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:32,300
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me or I had friends for support and</font>

151
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:37,310
sometimes that when I did

152
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I put in a genuine effort each time even</font>

153
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:43,370
if it was for only a short spurt now in

154
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,520
California I worked up the courage to

155
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:50,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">run a beautiful bubble gum pink beach</font>

156
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,639
cruiser I nervously paste outside the

157
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,400
bike shop I look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was casing the</font>

158
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,199
joint I'm so nervous I was walking back

159
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,719
and forth so when I finally decided to

160
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the plunge and went inside I asked</font>

161
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,969
a woman in the bike shop<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most</font>

162
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,210
solid most durable<font color="#E5E5E5"> baddest hired bike</font>

163
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:10,520
that was best for beginners so she<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

164
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,400
me this beautiful bubble gum pink beach

165
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,109
cruiser so she's you know sighing out

166
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,508
all the stuff to me so I nervously

167
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,330
started chattering on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> traumatic</font>

168
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,069
may happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I might get emotional I</font>

169
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,539
may only have this bike out for five or

170
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten minutes and I might bring it back</font>

171
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:29,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I'm bit cold the cucumber she looks</font>

172
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,659
at me you know I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to judge you</font>

173
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,449
you take however long or short<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

174
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:37,400
want but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only take five or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

175
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:40,009
minutes please<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I still have to</font>

176
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,609
charge<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flower fair enough</font>

177
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:46,699
friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i started to pedal away</font>

178
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:50,840
and honestly I look like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> newborn</font>

179
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:55,759
giraffe trying to span I heard her call

180
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,190
out to me I believe in you authority to

181
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,380
do that bolstered by this random like

182
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,620
shop woman's kindness and confidence in

183
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:09,050
me I pedaled out to port penis five

184
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:11,960
miles away<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you sure I</font>

185
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,729
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrified while doing it but I</font>

186
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,229
completed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 mile round-trip</font>

187
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,840
journey because I still<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

188
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,520
bike back and quick side note you know I

189
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,580
looked up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and uber to see if one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,289
could take that bike I totally totally

191
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,878
was on my phone going is there anybody

192
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,419
can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> me up because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think five</font>

193
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,129
miles is an accomplishment right but

194
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,390
fortunately the bike gods were again you

195
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,560
know we're with me that day and they

196
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">were like no you better get your butt</font>

197
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,869
back on that bike and go return it

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,849
before you own that like but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> returned</font>

199
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,459
I was in one piece I returned that bike

200
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,240
i was walking triumphantly stride of

201
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:48,569
pride back into the bike shop

202
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,149
and I realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I could continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

203
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,640
work on mastering this skill this is a

204
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,380
skill that's difficult for me but I know

205
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's one that comes easier to</font>

206
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,480
others and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's okay so breaking it</font>

207
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,490
down that way breaking bike riding down

208
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,240
that way helps me to take the fear out

209
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,600
of it networking with people or bike

210
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,550
riding does not have to be scary it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

211
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,550
just be a skill to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be learned or hound</font>

212
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:22,290
so there's this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy named Lenny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opus yo</font>

213
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:24,180
peace ll<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh pif entrepreneur he has like</font>

214
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,730
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> different flashes after his name</font>

215
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,189
of what he is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it is that he</font>

216
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,709
actually does other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make great</font>

217
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,450
quotes i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but you always have</font>

218
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:34,859
these great quotes about networking so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

219
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:39,500

220
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:44,250
going to to say today so one is

221
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,140
networking is not easy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some it's</font>

222
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,420
like having to take a required class in

223
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,430
college that you have no interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

224
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,729
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order to</font>

225
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:56,849
graduate so<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember in business and in</font>

226
00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:00,270
life success is<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from how to do</font>

227
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,440
things you don't like doing so don't

228
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,779
give me the excuse that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

229
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network if you need to be want to be</font>

230
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,120
successful in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> career you need to do</font>

231
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,500
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you don't like so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a</font>

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,770
professional networking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a seesaw</font>

233
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,649
giving and taking and<font color="#CCCCCC"> balance good</font>

234
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:19,649
networkers<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll think about what he or</font>

235
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:22,770
she can do for the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> person before</font>

236
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,899
asking for something for themselves but

237
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to use the phrase that I did</font>

238
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,820
come up with cultivate your network like

239
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,310
a garden you know you need to paint

240
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,680
maintain your professional network not

241
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,810
too much and overworked them and not too

242
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">little that they wither away kind of</font>

243
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,170
like you know rotating crops and leaving

244
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,920
one fallow so that it can regain

245
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,959
nutrients again it's best to stagger the

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,959
timing of your correspondence and the

247
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:51,699
stagger the timing of favors to ask so

248
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,868
that you don't burn through<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network</font>

249
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:54,549
you know the point of me telling you

250
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:57,279
this is that if you feel like networking

251
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:59,379
is slimy and underhanded then either you

252
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,149
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person you're networking with and</font>

253
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,799
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it wrong that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

254
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:06,549
this works that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> how any of this</font>

255
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,439
works so it should be a cultivated give

256
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:10,269
and take so what if you are in a

257
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:13,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation where someone is doing it</font>

258
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:15,730
wrong step away unless for some reason

259
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:17,290
they have some you know the return on

260
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,259
investment for you networking with them

261
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,660
is super high then take charge kind of

262
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:25,089
lead the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation away from you know</font>

263
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">the slimy area but if you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

264
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,129
reason to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking them walk away</font>

265
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,139
there's a i think in dating and

266
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:33,910
networking there's a rule of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirds a</font>

267
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,069
third of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meet are going</font>

268
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,419
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in some way so in</font>

269
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,488
dating it would be they would like you

270
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,619
another third of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can help</font>

271
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:43,299
them enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

272
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:45,809
like them and there's gonna be a third

273
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:49,358
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to run away</font>

274
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:52,238
in dating and networking and that's fine

275
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:54,579
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine so you know even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font>

276
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:56,109
someone that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can help you</font>

277
00:11:54,579 --> 00:12:00,339
you still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to</font>

278
00:11:56,109 --> 00:12:01,720
help them and if you're newer in your

279
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,709
career and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and you're</font>

280
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably sitting there thinking like</font>

281

296
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,339
information and sometimes that

297
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,189
information is a person because that

298
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:45,220
person has information so think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

299
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:48,669
that way have that perspective and you

300

know it's a give and take so now we're

301
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,899
going to touch upon a pet peeve of mine

302
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:54,999
as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> relates to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> networking so if the</font>

303
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:59,619
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> crook so hands here how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

304
00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:01,139
you self-identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an introvert okay I</font>

305
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:06,299
expected that

306
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:12,749
so raise your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> extrovert yeah we're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the loudest ooh amba verte anybody know</font>

309
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:23,189
ok so my pet peeve is that I hate those

310
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,859
words ultimately why I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a monster</font>

311
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:28,649
I'll explain ok so my pet peeve isn't

312
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:32,609
necessarily that people use them to

313
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:35,040
self-identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real time</font>

314
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:36,540
they have real meanings as<font color="#CCCCCC"> theorized</font>

315
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,839
like Carl Jung I don't know if you knew

316
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,540
that was Carl Jung no pepper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pervert</font>

317
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,669
which was coined by kimball<font color="#CCCCCC"> jaan in 1927</font>

318
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,540
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of thought I don't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

319
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:50,669
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what else we knew ok so what</font>

320
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,849
my pet peeve is my pet peeve is that

321
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:56,939

322
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,799

like oh I got this thing I got this it's

434

communicate your value as a professional

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,949
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you some different</font>

439
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,928
examples of networking experiences that

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,269
I've done and how to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself out</font>

441
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:52,679
there and how networking communicates

442
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:54,749
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I used</font>

443
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,149
to take the train into work and I would

444
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:59,999
commute in and on the platform will be

445
00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:03,059
this partner at the firm<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I would</font>

446
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:04,710
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her on the train platform and I</font>

447
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,379
know when my friends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience is</font>

448
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,820
a lawyer I'm not making any<font color="#E5E5E5"> pastor</font>

449
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:10,889
disparaging comments about about

450
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,049
attorneys but attorney feel like usually

451
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:15,089
like to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves usually so</font>

452
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,859
all you have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know you know</font>

453
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:18,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">how's your practice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going what sort of</font>

454
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:20,100
things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you working on your practice</font>

455
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,840
so see

456
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,149
tell me the things as<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was working on</font>

457
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,320
and yeah we do this all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

458
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,850
then we would get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the train and then</font>

459
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,049
sit different different places and not

460
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,330
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other and that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally</font>

461
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:32,010
fine again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew my limitations first</font>

462
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,570
thing in the morning I could handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

463
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,340
few minutes waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the train and</font>

464
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,350
then I wanted to sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

465
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,918
knitting and listen to podcasts and

466
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,649
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so my job at the</font>

467
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,539
library was to handle a lot of the

468
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,490
acquisitions and development and things

469
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,890
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one day I see this book</font>

470
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,169
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself you know and</font>

471
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,760
again networking thinking of others oh I

472
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this would be great for her</font>

473
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
practice and it was of a dollar amount

474
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,668
that i had authority to purchase so i

475
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,289
bought the book and gave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to her a</font>

476
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:03,030
little note saying no you know based on

477
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:05,039
our conversations<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think this would be</font>

478
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">good for your practice so six months</font>

479
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,830
later she emailed my boss the library

480
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,440
director copies me on it and says that

481
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:17,730
book has not left my desk in six months

482
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,159
I've 13 cases for the firm as a direct

483
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,770
result of that book and it was all

484
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,380
because she thought to ask me about my

485
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:29,129
practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do thank</font>

486
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks and I never you know I never</font>

487
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,429
expected to hear from her again and I

488
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,039
was fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that but to have that</font>

489
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:37,260
validation that just chatting up someone

490
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,140
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know remembering it and</font>

491
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,720
doing something about it and so into her

492
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,990
mind that's proving my value proving the

493
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,940
department's value proving value awesome

494
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,370
networking so now i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

495
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,860
an example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how external networking</font>

496
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,209
helps me internally so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i used to be</font>

497
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">really involved and i still i'm a member</font>

498
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,320
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the special Libraries Association and</font>

499
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,360
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to their conferences and we</font>

500
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,000
would meet librarians from all over the

501
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,949
world and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly came close</font>

502
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,190
because I'm a big angle of a nerd so a

503
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,140
lot of the uk-based librarians so one

504
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,539
day one of the senior partners called a

505
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,940
meeting with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the director and the</font>

506
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:19,970
firm was opening an office somewhere in

507
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Middle East</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huntley redacted and</font>

508
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's definitely very specific that I</font>

509
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,610
thought was odd he rattled off three big

510
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:32,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known law firms that were uk-based</font>

511
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,340
said they've been there for years I want

512
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,390
the library that they have now on the

513
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,189
face value that sounds like an

514
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,799
impossible task right you're like well

515
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,450
help do it how do I know I makeup user

516
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,879
loss on libraries they're not like it's

517
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,290
not like the you know library Congress

518
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,770
we can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like walk in like they're</font>

519
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">all I raised so I just start to smile</font>

520
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,510
and my boss is looking at me like what

521
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:57,510
are we gonna do in like I got this

522
00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:01,470
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking I knew librarians</font>

523
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:03,360
ahead those three firms got back to my

524
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,190
office send an email to all three at the

525
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,780
same time so that I wasn't wasting their

526
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,630
time because I knew one of them would

527
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,790
clean it and let the others know so the

528
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,429
one replied right away and said my boss

529
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,440
opened that office in that country<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

530

the you know the collection from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

537
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,899

how in the world are we gonna get this

544
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:55,590

down the hall to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss's office put it</font>

548
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,850

549
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,189
partner mr. the part was like damn like

550
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,230

559
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:29,370

00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:32,280
the fun pay for me to go to those

561

562
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,970
start to prove things you know you prove

563
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,220
value so

564
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,500
you're like okay that's library world

565
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,410
Mazel Tov to you for doing good<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

566
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,860
how does this work into creating a

567
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,870
culture of security okay so this is

568
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,909
where that intrapreneurial spirit comes

569
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,679
in I don't know who coined the word in

570
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,260
from the preneur but I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and use</font>

571
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:59,790
it all the time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like the word</font>

572
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:02,670
entrepreneur but in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> case you didn't</font>

573
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick up on that so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about having the</font>

574
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,740
drive and ingenuity of an entrepreneur

575
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,649
but within the confines of your

576
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,320
organization so suing things like

577
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,900
branding and name recognition either of

578
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,389
yourself or of your department<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

579
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,770
your users who I don't know this has

580
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,060
ever been brought up before an infosec

581
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:23,730
but you know your users are your

582
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,260
customers right like you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

583
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,600
customer service and treat them

584
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,670
accordingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you need to have that</font>

585
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,219
your internal customers know who you are

586
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:34,620
and what you do so that you build this

587
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,060
sense of value and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I believe</font>

588
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,459
my girl are you'll talk about that a

589
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,090
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit early in her talk so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

590
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,550
all done family nicely with that because

591
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:47,939
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make allies not enemies of</font>

592
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,169
the people that you're trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

593
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,570
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to hear some stories of</font>

594
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,640
internal networking related to things

595
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,530
that I've done now granted they're not

596
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,850
necessarily security related but I trust

597
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,680
you're all are intelligent enough to

598
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:01,709
figure out how to apply to us through

599
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,170
security situation so I had six points

600
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,200
i'm kind of sick sickle<font color="#CCCCCC"> serves number</font>

604
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,600

605
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,270
only is that topic important to me but I

606
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,980
knew it was a great way to network

607
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:22,410
internally and to get to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

608
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,510
internal customers and just kind of

609
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:29,570
better represent myself and my

610
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:32,100
department so funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> story was funny now</font>

611
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,230
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first meetings you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

big intimidating long shiny tables

614
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:43,500
everybody at the long table was an

615
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,180
attorney but me and I was all aware of

616
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,610
this fact but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a big deal</font>

of it

618
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,049
and then I hear a booming voice from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

respectful sword away so let's talk

660
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,510

hurts and the shirt into that and that's

662
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:40,239

745
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,779
was in the outer offices because when i

746
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,309
work for law firms i would be in

747
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,169

750
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,100
into offices and ask questions and sure

751
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:49,500
there were times I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

752
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,870
doing this I would just want to sit at

753
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,520
my desk<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other office and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do</font>

754
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,870
my stuff so what I used to do when I

755
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,520
come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning I used to get it do</font>

756
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,620
you see a lot so I would come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

757
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,190
morning send an email out as a warning a

758
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:04,229
flare was fired item in your office<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

759
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,059
coming around today if you have anything

760
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,470
so they were also warned so I guess

761
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,610
forgave them fair warning if they didn't

762
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,679
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to me they could keep the</font>

763
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:14,428
door shut but so anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the door</font>

764
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,350
open was fair game so i would i would go

765
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:18,149
into these offices now there's a scene

766
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,760
from 30 rock which one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite</font>

767
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:22,889
shows where Jack Donaghy was accused of

768
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">only looking at people and things in</font>

769
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:27,390
their dollar value and he looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at her</font>

770
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,730
room and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything on it had a dollar</font>

771
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,620
value on it everything that's how I walk

772
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,779
into an attorney's office because I knew

773
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,879
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much those books cost and if I saw</font>

774
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:38,700
one still sitting in shrink wrap I knew

775
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,169
they didn't need it so I would walk in I

776
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,299
would talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them about their beach</font>

777
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:44,580
house or their vacation or their kids or

778
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:47,070
whatever and I the whole time I was

779
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:50,189
scanning scanning what are they not

780
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:51,809
using what<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five hundred dollars and</font>

781
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,090
I need to remind them<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs five hundred</font>

782
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,250
dollars and they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be using or what</font>

783
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,320
are they using this out of date many

784
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,620
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times I would find books and I</font>

785
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,720
would

786
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,189
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew so for you would be</font>

787
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,230
knowing your network I knew my

788
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,210
collection I knew my collection by

789
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,340
looking at it there was a turning hood

790
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,990
all niggas credenza behind him a book

791
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like even just kind of like went</font>

792
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,220
like this and I said oh you're not using

793
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,350
that are you it goes yeah i'm using it

794
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,140
right now for a case I said that's two

795
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:22,709
editions old I'm like stop what you're

796
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,170
doing let me get you a new one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew my</font>

797
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,510
my customers and my collection that well

798
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:31,290
that I could walk into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an office and</font>

799
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:33,420
know that so again it's a little bit

800
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,610
more different with networks but<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

801
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,470
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network know things know</font>

802
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,290
get to know your users if you walk into

803
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:43,080
a user's office and you see a bunch of

804
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:46,290
devices like hey are you connected to

805
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,909
our Wi-Fi is your device updated things

806
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,960
like that in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind that would be the</font>

807
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:54,750
equivalent of the book situation so

808
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,610
let's move ahead here so then my buddy

809
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Glen said that networking is a</font>

810
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,139
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it requires active</font>

811
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:04,590
behavior you need to be engaged<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

812
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,780
what others are doing I went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> graduate</font>

813
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:10,678
school for the dark arts of library

814
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:12,510
science and I have we were to have this

815
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,770
master's degree in library science and

816
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,290
one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about</font>

817
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,879
the reference interview so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> record</font>

818
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,370
set of you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like troubleshooting</font>

819
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,900
so not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it asking questions of</font>

820
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,699
what the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> once but it's listening</font>

821
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,250
for what they're not saying and then you

822
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,400
ask them about that so active listening

823
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">i believe it was again sorry ariel you</font>

824
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,210
said two years one mouth listen more

825
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">than you talk listen to what these</font>

826
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,840
people are saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can have some time</font>

827
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,490
but they don't know what they're asking

828
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,740
for i used to have these two books that

829
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">were very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar in title but we're</font>

830
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,750
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different in legal content and</font>

831
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,940
price nine times out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten attorneys</font>

832
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,220
would say to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need this book and I</font>

833
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,990
knew they meant the other one so much so

834
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,179
that I had a canned email all ready to

835
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,700
go saying I know you asked me<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

836
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:58,470
but I know you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

837
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,179
had pictures of both books in the email

838
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,130
nine times out of ten was oh you're

839
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:06,870
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the unlike you I know</font>

840
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:09,060
so again you need to listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

841
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,350
people aren't saying is and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

842
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,060
sounds weird I know that sounds like

843
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of again like weird black mass</font>

844
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:17,070
stuff but just you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you have to</font>

845
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,050
start practicing it and learn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

846
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:20,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">out where the gap what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information don't</font>

847
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have what are they not saying</font>

848
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,520
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's usually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the problem</font>

849
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,230
lies because they don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

850
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,350
explain it they don't know the word for

851
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it they don't know how to do it so</font>

852
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:32,610
communication is key so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my past</font>

853
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,880
jobs I wrote an internal newsletter

854
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,470
called five for friday and it was it

855
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,030
contained the five most important items

856
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:41,189
that had happened that<font color="#E5E5E5"> week in that</font>

857
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,780
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would receive feedback all</font>

858
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,090
the time from people who'd be like I

859
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:49,410
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I learned that from</font>

860
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:51,660
your email so i can people want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

861
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,699
stuff and again just gives you the

862
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,790
opportunity to place yourself in an area

863
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,560
of value and trust and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will come to</font>

864
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,850
you and ask you questions now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

865
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,440
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are probably like rolling</font>

866
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,490
their eyes at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like oh no hell no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

867
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,470
don't want everybody asking the

868
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,060
questions all the time so what would

869
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,950
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me is there were times when</font>

870
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,190
legitimately people would follow up with

871
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:15,120
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't my job did I</font>

872
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:17,850
say that no but what i would do is i

873
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,710
would call pick up the phone call the

874
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,060
reference desk and get one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

875
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,970
co-workers on the phone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll say hi</font>

876
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have so and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a reference</font>

877
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,959
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would tell the person on</font>

878
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,370
the other line you know I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

879
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,010
with that but let me connect you with

880
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:33,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone who can rather than just blind</font>

881
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,150
transfer I would get the information

882
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,920
ahead of time and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say to my</font>

883
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,500
coworker so on says calling and they

884
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,080
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they need to look up</font>

885
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,400
some statutes in Minnesota or something

886
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,049
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what they won't</font>

887
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,880
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much information ahead of time so</font>

888
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,320
that your customer isn't relaying the

889
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,660
story all over again because they think

890
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,640
that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help and so I'm just taking</font>

891
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,620
copious notes to digital and then

892
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,420
cheerfully handing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off and go in</font>

893
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,460
there so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to do that there</font>

894
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a way you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know yeah the downside is</font>

895
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,400
that everyone's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come then come</font>

896
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,560
to you and ask you questions well

897
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,270
legitimately figure out what isn't what

898
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,580
isn't your job and if it's you're not

899
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:11,370
not your job hand it over on a silver

900
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,779
platter you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of</font>

901
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,400
stores but they just don't point to

902
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,410
things like let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me walk and show you</font>

903
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,400
there and do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know sometimes</font>

904
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,960
you're just like okay this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

905
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,640
awkward I wish you would just point show

906
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,860
me but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font>

907
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,509
experience okay and you go do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

908
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just</font>

909
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it over and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that just works</font>

910
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:29,150
magic and then you know it takes two

911
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,920
seconds out of my day to hand it over

912
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,590
and then I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like all those notes I can</font>

913
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,260
just move delete that mental file

914
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:40,280
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care anymore this is not</font>

915
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:43,010
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so you know that all this all</font>

916
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:46,040
this rolls in together as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

917
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">creating trusts creating allies so that</font>

918
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,700
when you need your users to do something

919
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,760
differently like change their habits

920
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:55,399
like not clicking on suspicion even

921
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that they're you</font>

922
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,520
know they're going to listen to you

923
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're going to trust you as a resource</font>

924
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,930
they're going to value what you have to

925
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,260
say because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was a lot of that in</font>

926
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:07,819
library world too we'd have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

927
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,280
databases all the time copyright we'd

928
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,780
have to you know I might get one of my

929
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,940
jokes more recently as you know

930
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,500
copyright<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know librarian is very</font>

931
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,270
much like infosec because if you don't

932
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">think copyright or security correctly</font>

933
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,540
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into trouble</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

934
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,760
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to talk to attorneys all</font>

935
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:25,180
the time about copyright like please

936
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn that CD ROM from the library</font>

937
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:31,210
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the university library</font>

938
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:33,440
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't own that book and well the</font>

939
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,060
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have all kinds of</font>

940
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,270
conversation like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we don't own</font>

941
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,820
that's that DVD you can't burn that he

942
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,920
can see in bed so that was that was a

943
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,350
struggle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I had to deal with was</font>

944
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,970
named after people for copyright in much

945
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,860
like you with security I couldn't always

946
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,299
see what they were doing and I would

947
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal since I was the point</font>

948
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,050
person I'd have to deal with the angry

949
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,359
phone calls from vendors going<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-and-so</font>

950
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">shared all this content with you know I</font>

951
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,680
found people would email stuff around

952
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:03,200
that was supposed to be proprietary

953
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,759
database content and somehow the email

954
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,830
trail would always wind up back at the

955
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,510
vendor and I get the phone call and like

956
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on top of them twenty-four</font>

957
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven so it's like okay we'll have</font>

958
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,660
another copyright training again but

959
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,460
because I would develop these good

960
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,690
relationships with these people I could

961
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,810
go to them and like sit in their office

962
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,370
and be like dude how many times we have

963
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,130
to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through this because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

964
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,779
earned the right to to go up there and

965
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,740
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like okay we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little</font>

966
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,540
talk and have a

967
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,299
his parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close with one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

968
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,759
story so a great example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is how</font>

969
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,220
I earn my stripes to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to be an</font>

970
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,260
authority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we had an associate</font>

971
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,720
join one of the times i was working at

972
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,670
just demanded a ridiculous amount of

973
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,759
resources just thousands of dollars of

974
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:52,070
books from discipline the outside is

975
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,420
practicing yeah like your security of

976
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,160
attorney why do you need family law

977
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,890
books like what are you what are you

978
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing and oh well one day I might want</font>

979
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that I'm like okay well one day</font>

980
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,100
i'll buy that for you but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fine</font>

981
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,930
and for you now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't need it to do</font>

982
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:09,589
your job because it's very crucial I

983
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:12,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">always did my best to know what my users</font>

984
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:15,080
jobs were if I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I would ask</font>

985
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,220
you know tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about your job because</font>

986
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,750
if they're fighting you on something

987
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,080
that's probably a really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why</font>

988
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:23,060
they want it or they need it and

989
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,830
different thing so ask them what their

990
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,270
jobs are and that's how and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

991
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,590
I go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> before about asking the</font>

992
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,630
attorney tell me about your practice

993
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:32,420
that's another way of what do you do all

994
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:35,180
day and knows what you have so

995
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,800
paralegals secretaries admin assistants

996
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,118
whatever it would have you I would ask

997
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,660
them you know tell me about your job

998
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:43,940
what is it how do you use this resource

999
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,890
so because I knew what this associates

1000
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,500
job was I knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he didn't need those</font>

1001
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,420

1002
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,820
and he went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very very senior</font>

1003
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,740
partner and started complaining about

1053
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:13,049
of that thing and network so you feel

1054
00:42:08,249 --> 00:42:16,470
better networking with humans is a skill

1055
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:18,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be learned and honed you can</font>

00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:21,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">then take those skills with your</font>

1062
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:41,230
we have time for questions or if I was

1063
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:44,140
really mean I forced you to network<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1064
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,520
each other but I don't know you guys

1065
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,779
were a really good audience so I don't

1066
00:42:45,520 --> 00:43:04,840
think I'll force anybody but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1067
00:42:46,780 --> 00:43:06,760
think a question yes hi that's another

1068
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:10,120
talk I give that I'm available for<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1069
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:13,330
someone wants to hire me Lincoln is a

1070
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:16,089
necessary evil it's um it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1071
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,009
necessarily good for internal networking

1072
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,720
which is what I was concentrating on

1073
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,690
today when I give other talks about

1074
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,609
networking I get more into using Twitter

1075
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,730
and social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media and LinkedIn for stuff</font>

1076
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:29,920
like that so I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the</font>

1077
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:33,130
continent comments related to to today's

1078
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,600
theme which you know you put a lot of

1079
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:38,110
companies have some sort of internal

1080
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,520
version of that but as far as like like

1081
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:42,190
external stuff it's just it's a

1082
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,230
necessary evil that you need to do it's

1083
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,270
a pretty terrible resource like it's

1084
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,710
just not you know intuitive they

1085
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,780

logged<font color="#E5E5E5"> in lately it looks pretty</font>

1087
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:55,720
terrible it's what people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

1088
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:59,530
people rely on it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just you just</font>

1089
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,879
need to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just I mean it doesn't</font>

1090
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:03,850
really help you internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> II and that's</font>

1091
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,160
kind of what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk was about so any</font>

1092
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:09,630
other questions does anybody have any

1093
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,629
like stories that they want to share

1094

1097
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,160
companies will have cocktail hours or

1098
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,259
some sort of event<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a holiday party</font>

1103
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,550
borrow from my external networking feel

1104
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:48,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I usually give is there's two ways</font>

hard sometimes I struggle with it myself

1160
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:50,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes you need to channel the energy</font>

1161
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,690
of someone else or a fictional character

1162

help you through it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the longest time</font>

1163

00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:00,369
head I was Oprah walking into a room<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1165
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:02,380
you know you get a business card you get

1166
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:04,990
a business card everybody gets a

1167
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,720
business card<font color="#CCCCCC"> I refined that a little</font>

1168
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:10,720
bit depending on the situation I draw

1169
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,910
energy from someone and that's what gets

1170
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,828
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> through it so you know it could be a</font>

1171
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:18,040
real person in infosec well as a dynamic

1172
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:20,230
personality like a Jason Street or it's

1173
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,150
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a fictional character I</font>

1174
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,680
don't play<font color="#CCCCCC"> those games but if you have</font>

1175
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:25,240
like an elf you created that's like

1176
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,980
really good at networking situation

1177
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,770
there's something you know maybe kind of

1178
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,510
that or you know like just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said a</font>

1179
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:34,180
personality like someone you know like

1180
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:36,280
an Oprah or somebody I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying that</font>

1181
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:38,859
you said like beat them but just handle

1182
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,540
that energy of like all right I can do

1183
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:42,130
15 minutes what would Oprah do in this

1184
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,750
situation Oprah would walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

1185
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:45,700
room and introduce introduce yourself to

1186
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,980
people does that make any sense like you

1187
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,540
if you can't find it within yourself to

1188
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,510
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I believe me fun days of</font>

1189
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:54,220
Hank Hank slow for me and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1190
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:56,920
depends my situation I was actually

1191
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,169
talking to someone recently for her

1192
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation she needed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very stoic</font>

1193
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:04,810
and diplomatic<font color="#CCCCCC"> what stand up for herself</font>

1194
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:07,240
I told her to channel julia sugarbaker

1195
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:08,619
from designing women<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dixie Carter was</font>

1196
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,589
the acura some stomach day to myself

1197
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:14,740
entirely acceptable be but she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

1198
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">very strong female southern character</font>

1199
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,569
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very polite and very from but</font>

1200
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,829
she got her point across and this person

1201
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:23,140
knew the characters I said girl wats

1202
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:25,510
upon to designing women and you know

1203
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,009
when your face in that situation just

1204
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:29,109
channel the energy it's really

1205
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sugarbaker so figure out who that is for</font>

1206
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:32,109
you and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you kind of go there</font>

1207
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,030
and then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how you go through</font>

1208
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1209
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:38,079
know and that you recognize and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1210
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,520
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of put it out there it helps</font>

1211
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,260
if you have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of connection if</font>

1212
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,080
you've done work for them

1213
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:47,800
or and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce</font>

1214
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:49,569
you to others<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helps</font>

1215
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,950
it's the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just going to</font>

1216
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,470
leave you with is what the library used

1217
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:56,740
to do is around holiday time we would

1218
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:58,540
bake cookies for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other departments</font>

1219
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,759
within the firm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we would go on</font>

1220
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,500
math<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like weird cookie parade and</font>

1221
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,570
we would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver them to the other</font>

1222
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,190
department and then we would say for a

1223
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,290
few minutes and to socialize and meet

1224
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,880
people so that like you know when other

1225
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,860
times of the year when like we really

1226
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,240
needed a favor or something like that it

1227
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,520
wasn't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were going up to a</font>

1228
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,069
stranger going<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

1229
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,950
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's like they'd be like oh yeah</font>

1230
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,420
what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need yeah and you know I've</font>

1231
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,339
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> some people argue with me that that</font>

1232
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,170
was like reinforcing female stereotypes

1233
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,360
in the workplace but we had men<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1234
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,130
library and they made cookies too but

1235
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,660
it's some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it doesn't have</font>

1236
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:34,960
to be cookie so some sort of goodwill

1237
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:36,609
that you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around other times of</font>

1238
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,050
the year and see people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other</font>

1239
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,000
department so that when you are faced

1240
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:42,250
with a networking situation you're going

1241
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,070
to have some familiar faces to go up to

1242
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:47,410
so I hope that that helps so awesome so

1243

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> coolest huh I mean you see me around</font>
