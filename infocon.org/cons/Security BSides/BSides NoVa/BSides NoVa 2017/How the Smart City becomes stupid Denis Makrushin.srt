insane so the data or the main window

the we don't be so paper with your data

appeared for project what you can do

387
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,610
with that guy your idea this is a resin

you can make supporters of the

of the leakage another example what if

00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:02,129
you can do with that you can extract the

previously released his data there and

466
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:18,178
you can create it and where the targeted

<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic that was mad well in all smash</font>

486
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:17,429
clearly you know the stupid thing just

487
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,969
has a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> business function is this</font>

488
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:23,639
it's a measure the speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it</font>

never appear to your server the speed

00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:36,669
has had on my ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it has a</font>

Bluetooth connection yeah

493
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:49,460
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think okay no I probably</font>

494
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:52,279
have an idea coming up for for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 74</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thermos proposal yes its uses for a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">servant proposes that it has bluetooth</font>

497
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:01,909
connection without any identification so

498
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:04,610
anyone could connect using bluetooth

499
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:07,850
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could express it instead of</font>

and a blended again so he could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice</font>

502
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:18,500
good on the world because he could have

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:22,580
his own car his rank are in the database

504
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,509
like some<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception fancy I speed clip</font>

505
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,428
so as a result you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in the world</font>

506
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:34,070
for another example is a traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera</font>

507
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:38,450
or network of traffic so what the

00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:42,080
external criminal has a duty to extract

509
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:44,690

512
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:55,070
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that speed parameter</font>

513
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:57,379
reckon it'd help it monitors the numbers

514
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,779
the special<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers under the car and</font>

515
00:32:57,379 --> 00:33:02,750
then compare the numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:06,110
internal database of stolen car numbers

517
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,179
then if it number contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> certain</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">proficient to the internal to reserve a</font>

519
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:14,330
thorough so the simple to the fashion

00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:16,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it has often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spoken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that had no</font>

00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:22,008
less than one to display the stream

00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:26,000

world like grass on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road</font>

529
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:47,429
so if your developer please restrict

533
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,970
high technology to restrict the

the Milky is when your new still becomes

00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:50,769
that had a connection with this goose

716

device for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

be mad and something interesting it

718
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:58,900
amazes the main means of machine there

00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:03,308
has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection recollections with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">reduce medical device then you just can</font>

721
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:08,200
this machine and you can see you rather

interesting and 3.5 vulnerable<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTP</font>

machine even the point the malware and

725
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:23,259
in this case even<font color="#CCCCCC"> half-life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asian i</font>

726
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:25,329
don't know why but how while<font color="#E5E5E5"> asian and</font>

machine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had connections with a</font>

00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:28,539
miracle with vision express that medical

center device

730
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:36,669
I don't know what I polish it wasn't out

731
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:40,299
there that it is but anyway using this

732
00:50:36,669 --> 00:50:42,969
is report you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

733
00:50:40,299 --> 00:50:46,140
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> demented you can extract the process</font>

734
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:49,469
means of interesting software and

735
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:54,009
another I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> social</font>

00:50:49,469 --> 00:50:56,619
cybercriminal made their decision yes

737
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:59,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">welcome this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine let me carry strap</font>

738
00:50:56,619 --> 00:51:02,619
using this analyzer I mirando<font color="#CCCCCC"> topics a</font>

739
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:05,890
special offer for this medical

740
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:08,529
diagnostic devices using this analyzer

741
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:11,229
like anniversary can do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that first</font>

742
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:13,959
of all PSP apparently prompted machine

743
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:16,058
he gets to the medical information he

744
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:18,549
has proved the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

745
00:51:16,059 --> 00:51:20,890
miracle machine he can put the data so

746
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:23,859
nothing is a worse scenario here because

747
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:27,069
if you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want expression to</font>

748
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:30,400
use it for they and others proposes I

749
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:32,140
think you can make the wrong the end of

750
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,499
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world ethics for that for your</font>

751
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:38,618
patient and also you can change the

752
00:51:35,499 --> 00:51:42,609
parameters of this machine so<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

753
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:46,150
the adversary could create something

754
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:48,578
like special man where for that and then

755
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:52,929
he could change with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could change the</font>

756
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:55,390
calibration parameter and ransom for

757
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:58,869
yourself because that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> please send me</font>

759
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:08,679

<font color="#E5E5E5">aircraft about four thousand dollars and</font>

761
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:14,140
as a result you can pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that you</font>

762
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:16,959
need to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for calibration so</font>

763
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,569
it's a work case where he can define

764
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:22,868
help appease the dishes but not in this

765
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:27,479
world not in the current work they don't
