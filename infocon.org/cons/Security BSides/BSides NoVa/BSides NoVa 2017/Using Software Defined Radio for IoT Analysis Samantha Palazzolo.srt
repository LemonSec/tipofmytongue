00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,980
hi good morning everyone we're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

3
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a few seconds but any reminder</font>

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,300
for everyone please don't block the

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,980
stairway is just for fire hazard reasons

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,019
and for the ease of everyone else coming

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,148
into the room other than that please

8
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:52,530
give a warm welcome for Samantha para

9
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:54,719
verlo oh good morning as she mentioned

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,190
my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Samantha parabola and today</font>

11
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,010
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about using software</font>

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,190
defined radio to analyze IOT devices

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,850
specifically wireless protocols of IOT

14
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,700
devices so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> device it can be</font>

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,669
anything from you know an IOT hub the

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,770
light bar the door lock something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,270
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really sure exactly what's</font>

18
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,580
going on wirelessly right like what kind

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,399
of information is sending what's the

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,460
format things like that so epinephrine

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,930
radio or<font color="#CCCCCC"> scr is a resource for gathering</font>

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,479
information on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm listening on over the</font>

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,970
air and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are being sent so</font>

24
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,890
the reason why I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of give</font>

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,289
this talk is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been working with</font>

26
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,360
wireless communication but for about

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,229
five years but I'm by no means<font color="#CCCCCC"> an expert</font>

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,299
I mean just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do not feel confident with</font>

29
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:50,670
doing DSP which is a very complex field

30
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:53,009
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time somehow I'm able to</font>

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,780
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> ser using tools and able to do</font>

32
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,670
these analyses and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,340
worth sharing some of the tools and

34
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,350
techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use for individuals</font>

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,619
being started in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area and who want</font>

36
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:08,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to learn some of the basics for how you</font>

37
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:11,910
go about doing an analysis like this so

38
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the steps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I follow different</font>

39
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,349
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have different</font>

40
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,780
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to go</font>

41
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:20,888
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> today you start with gathering</font>

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,859
device information checking so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

43
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually these steps can apply to other</font>

44
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:29,260
wireless signals the only thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,048
kind of patio I would put that I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

46
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,849
consider IOT specific is checking for

47
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:36,430
basic RF replay and i'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

48
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:40,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means a little bit in a little bit</font>

49
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,790
so another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to point out is</font>

50
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,620
that when i talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our F I'm just</font>

51
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,388
referring to a wireless signal for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,370
purpose of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk so if i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push</font>

53
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:52,060
between the two that's what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

54
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,709
about so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> step and I can't</font>

55
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,049
stress<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough that you really should be</font>

56
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,609
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> step for anyone looking at a</font>

57
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:01,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">wireless device is gathering device</font>

58
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:05,049
information so luckily in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. if</font>

59
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:07,239
something is radiating on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacific and</font>

60
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:09,209
even some things that are rotating

61
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:13,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">justina by computers will have to have</font>

62
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:15,609
an FCC ID and this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for</font>

63
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:19,509
information gathering so when you go you

64
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:21,459
let up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC idea either to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do those</font>

65
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:23,500
sites for work but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

66
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,900
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> frequency the bandwidth</font>

67
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,849
modulation some of the source inc

68
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,680
information about the signal but in

69
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,259
addition sometimes would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">always generally have internal photos</font>

71
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,918
and sometimes they won't walk out the

72
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,299
chips what they're using so you can

73
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,340
actually get information there that you

74
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,340
can use for other kinds of analyses of

75
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,759
the device I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of I've never</font>

76
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,449
seen myself that you can get cymatics in

77
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:53,649
some cases but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FCC ID</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lookup is</font>

78
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:55,629
probably in one of the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> key key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steps</font>

79
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,939
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will give you a lot of information</font>

80
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:00,518
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you need or something like wireless</font>

81
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:02,049
analysis so the other things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

82
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,969
collect as much information as you can

83
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,790
there may be people who did previous

84
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,290
research and have created tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

85
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,108
device that protocol you're looking at

86
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,909
and even patent useful because they can

87
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:15,849
tell you the format's maybe some of the

88
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:17,589
packet formats or or how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CRF</font>

89
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,509
protocols is actually working over the

90
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,849
air so all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really</font>

91
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,169
useful so in order to kind of go through

92
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:24,250
these steps and actually going to use

93
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font>

94
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,510
sample system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually an ecosystem</font>

95
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:34,600
of devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through so</font>

96
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,550
are doing the first step these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,950
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the examples of information that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

98
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,430
was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain by you know Ewing FCC</font>

99
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,770
ID manuals and the like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> key features</font>

100
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out is the center</font>

101
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,760
frequency is so 915 megahertz that's

102
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,100
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me where to look that's for me</font>

103
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,400
what I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on when I want to</font>

104
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,500
actually do something with the SVRs so

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,750
the other two items<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've</font>

106
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,330
highlighted are the modulation method as

107
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,030
a stereo sequency shifting<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer if you</font>

108
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,859
don't know so much about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

109
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,140
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something it does a search to learn</font>

110
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,350
a little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> manchester line</font>

111
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:16,300
encoding so those two are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come</font>

112
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:18,340
up a little bit so before we go any

113
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">further what is software-defined radio</font>

114
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,289
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sbr so in my mind there's</font>

115
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,990
actually two main components to an SDR

116
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:29,080
there's the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there are some</font>

117
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,380
examples there and the hardware kind of

118
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,570
has a frequency range it operates over a

119
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,370
few i think the top three in general

120
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,560
actually have versions that have

121
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,320
arranged from 70 megahertz up to 60

122
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,810
service and covers a lot of crs that

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">interest people most things operate in</font>

124
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,050
there and you know cellular<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS see</font>

125
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">unlicensed or I assemb and a lot of</font>

126
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,400
stuff can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seen within that range so</font>

127
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,190
the other thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these devices is</font>

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,469
that some are trans women receive and

129
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,919
some are only received so it kind of

130
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,930
depends on what your purpose or what

131
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,570
you're used is for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SPR hardware</font>

132
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,210
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what you want to use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

133
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,479
and then the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the SVR</font>

134
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,770
software so the software of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the</font>

135
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:19,240
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> is open source and like I said</font>

136
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,219
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of depends on what</font>

137
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,900
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it for so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

138
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,290
specifically talk about throughout my

139
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,539
talk two new radio and Jeter<font color="#CCCCCC"> X which are</font>

140
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,880
two tools that I favor when I do an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex</font>

141
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like this but everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has their own</font>

142
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,560
set up their own system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they like</font>

143
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,979
it's just kind of over time you try

144
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,699
things out and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what works for you</font>

145
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:45,610
so j can we show some channels for IOT

146
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:47,590
device to SD r and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually kind</font>

147
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,229
of a data<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication channel for</font>

148
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,388
visual communications and I've kind of

149
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,070
just modified it to show an example of

150
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,259
what some of the steps were gonna end up

151
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:02,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through and a talk so if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

152
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:05,590
off with on the top says the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPR are not</font>

153
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,449
the SVR<font color="#E5E5E5"> sees me the IOT device and it</font>

154
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,369
has some kind of packet format and that

155
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,169
packet format was broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and spits</font>

156
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,000
and I'm going to state encoding and

157
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:15,669
there's seven kinds of data encoding

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,050
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel and coding line coding and</font>

159
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:20,799
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk today about some</font>

160
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,270
line encoding with our example that was

161
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,650
the Manchester encoding that I pointed

162
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">out earlier and so up here doesn't have</font>

163
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,330
it right then we had modulation and

164
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,849
modulation basically allows you to

165
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,740
modulate that digital information and

166
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,380
infant in an analog signal so you can

167
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,000
send it over<font color="#CCCCCC"> RS I send it over the</font>

168
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,580
channel which in this case is over the

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,409
air so what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out about</font>

170
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,419
modulation is that we have these bits

171
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:50,219
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you modulate it you get symbols</font>

172
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:54,219
so sok has two symbols of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero no one</font>

173
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:58,060
but something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 chrome is 64</font>

174
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,639
quadrature amplitude modulation 1064

175
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">symbols so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just something to be</font>

176
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of is that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a simple tips</font>

177
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,259
to you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is once again when you</font>

178
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,370
do a modulation and so you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> us over</font>

179
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:13,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel and basically at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

180
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,169
have to do the reverse you have to

181
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,750
demodulate decode and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

182
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,789
packet data back out so that's what

183
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:26,770
we're going to try to step through at a

184
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:28,000
very high level today so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go any</font>

185
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,380
further another thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,049
note about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're working</font>

187
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a known protocol Wi-Fi Bluetooth</font>

188

189
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,208
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use s the arts perfectly you</font>

190
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and it's not going to be</font>

191
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:45,609
necessarily easy it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you</font>

192
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,810
know the truth for these waveforms but

193
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,790
if all you're concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

194
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,569
packet data you're probably better off

195
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,849
using specialized hardware

196
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,890
now so there may be cases for example

197
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,210
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a different and</font>

198
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,270
interesting frequency that you don't

199
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,160
have hardware for or following<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind</font>

200
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,660
of pattern that's not in the standard or

201
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,949
or something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe</font>

202
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's something interesting about the</font>

203
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">RF in that case you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know str is what you</font>

204
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,880

<font color="#E5E5E5">hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's perfectly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright as</font>

206
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,480
well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> fcra you know as I'm going</font>

207
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:20,630
through right now it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for</font>

208
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:25,100
kind of the unknown unknown signaled

209
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:28,960
unknown proprietary protocols so the

210
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,100
first step is to capture the signal and

211
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,260
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the controls like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

212
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,670
said the a lot of the software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

213
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,860
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some capturing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

214
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,510
capability and when we capture something

215
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,500
you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep track of the</font>

216
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,939
settings that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok some overtime</font>

217
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll figure out which ones are useful</font>

218
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,920
to you but things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what frequencies</font>

219
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,300
as you capture on what's the offset

220
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,790
don't go over a little bit with our

221
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,890
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the sample rate how many</font>

222
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,660
samples per second is the hardware

223
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,370
taking in the information so these

224
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,439
things are important to keep track of

225
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,400
that will help you later on in the

226
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,110
analysis so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned</font>

227
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,300
teacher at this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite</font>

228
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,120
tools to use we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting started</font>

229
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,560
really quick if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have this installed</font>

230
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,940
on your system and their instructions

231
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,239
all over the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how to get</font>

232
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this installed and working you just</font>

233
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plug in your spr and</font>

234
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,660
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can choose your str from</font>

235
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,640
the menu and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started right away and</font>

236
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,199
you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see signals and</font>

237
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,900
there's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analogs demodulation</font>

238
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,030
that you can potentially do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

239
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,160
the easiest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do with this is for</font>

240
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,290
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in go to one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the radio</font>

241
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,010
stations and see if you can hear that

242
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping davaj like that so this is our</font>

243
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:45,590
signal if you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said it was</font>

244
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:48,590
9-15<font color="#CCCCCC"> mcgirt so my set of things would</font>

245
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">say is actually 914 and the reason why</font>

246
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:54,020
is that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdrs hard will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

247
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a little bit of a signal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at DC are</font>

248
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,740
at the center of sequencing and in order

249
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,949
to avoid that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have that not be an</font>

250
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,000
issue for my signal I have an offset

251
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,920
right

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,550
is offset so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know what my offset this</font>

253
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,790
is one matter let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a signal here</font>

254
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's ssk so got the two bunny ears right</font>

255
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:17,599
I met our two symbols right signal to 15

256
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,180
each frequency those it makes one some

257
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,070
symbol for one frequency Rivera 16 is

258
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,660
here the one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's modulating and</font>

259
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,460
that's what I expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so when I</font>

260
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,770
see the signal and I looked up online

261
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,450
but other than a selfie look like that's

262
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I should expect to see or something</font>

263
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:35,750
similar and finally we have the sample

264
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,910
rate just to keep in mind and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

265
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:42,920
please coming up why<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's important so</font>

266
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:46,270
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is check the basic or f3</font>

267
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,589
play so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little what do I mean by this</font>

268
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,890
it's actually a sanity check and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

269
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:53,180
explain a little bit why so<font color="#E5E5E5"> very free</font>

270
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,100
play means that you've captured the

271
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,290
signal right and you're just going to

272
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,200
replay that signal on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same frequency</font>

273
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,939
with one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDR that will transmit</font>

274
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,380
and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command</font>

275
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:09,710
executed by the device so this generally

276
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,990
shouldn't happen like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you</font>

277
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:15,530
know if you think door locks are not

278
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:18,080

279
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,189
playing the signal and opening it anyone

280
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,870
can get your house things like that

281
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,339
we've known about this there's like

282
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,950
rolling<font color="#E5E5E5"> codes and other things that</font>

283
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent it basically type of them</font>

284
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,490
happening but as I'm sure many of you

285
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,579
are learning with IOT devices you can

286
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:34,220
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they followed best practices</font>

287
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,260
when they've created these devices so

288
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,540
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of affinity check and</font>

289
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,240
before are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you transmit you really want</font>

290
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure you're following sec rules</font>

291
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,310
and can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RS enclosures</font>

292
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:51,440
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your best bet so just this if you</font>

293
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:53,150
say so to do an r3 playing this is a new

294
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,860
radio companion<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a flowchart and</font>

295
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,350
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more about new</font>

296
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,630
radio companion in a bit but we

297
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,980
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file with a floral and the</font>

298
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,570
throttle is important because if you

299
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,110
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a throttle when you're</font>

300
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:08,480
replaying a signal and the new radio it

301
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,240
will try to sort of signal back as fast

302
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,589
as possible right and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

303
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,950
jumbled up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what you're looking</font>

304
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:16,860
for so you

305
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,900
so i captured at you know our case was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8</font>

306
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,820
mega samples per second so you want to

307
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,319
make sure your throttling at nigga

308
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,050
samples per second so it's going back

309
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the same on speed and then there's</font>

310
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the same in which case this is your</font>

311
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">spr I also personally like to have a</font>

312
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,050
visual thing so I can like see what I'm

313
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,680
transmitting it as a timing just a

314
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:40,109
preference so the reason why I have this

315
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,239
in here in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place is that even</font>

316
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,710
before doing the protocol now sits right

317
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,820
but you didn't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to signal you</font>

318
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,050
don't have to know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

319
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,710
signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just captured it and you</font>

320
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:52,349
recite it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to joke our example</font>

321
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">system I tried this with my balls I was</font>

322
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,590
like oh let me record the signal and

323
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,319
play it back and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens and</font>

324
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:01,500
guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I turned on and off hmm like</font>

325
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,960
okay look<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not a big deal though I</font>

326
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,330
mean you know it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and off mean</font>

327
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">II wouldn't affect you too much but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

328
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,440
turns out that you can integrate

329
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,050
something like a door walk into the

330
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,240
system and even though the door lock<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

331
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,300
has its own security mechanisms because

332
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,580
it's integrated into this other

333
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,040
ecosystem that doesn't have protections

334
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,020
against three plays you can replay a

335
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,380
signal that can unlock and lock the door

336
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sanity check by</font>

337
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,710
simply figuring out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is possible</font>

338
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:38,190
you learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about the system so</font>

339
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:40,440
a basic replay text so the next step and

340
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is in my opinion one of the</font>

341
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,210
more difficult that's the protocol

342
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,760
analysis so we have this capture file

343
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:51,630
and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is over you need to</font>

344
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,460
recapture it on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> str system with the</font>

345
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,710
word where and now he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

346
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">competitive modulation and it'll</font>

347
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:02,100
decoding and eventually we want packet

348
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:04,500
so kind of daunting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think if you think</font>

349
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,070
about it but there are tools that can

350
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,270
really help you with this analysis so

351
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to step through some of</font>

352
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:14,010
them so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little tour when I recently</font>

353
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,910
learned this one and I think this thing

354
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,890
is awesome is in spectrum so in spectrum

355
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,199
allows you just to see the signal this

356
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way a piece of the signal</font>

357
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,089
there's you can score

358
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">over horizontally and look at the rest</font>

359
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,709
of it but you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put here to open</font>

360
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,359
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> your file and put in the sample rate</font>

361
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:37,319
right the sample rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> keeps popping up</font>

362
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,990
over and over something important and

363
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,970
you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the signal and actually</font>

364
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,100
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system that we're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

365
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,970
application system you can see the other

366
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">food in CDs to like parallel rows with</font>

367
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:56,050
two different frequencies and it's a one

368
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:59,199
in the zero so if you wanted to using

369
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,240
this program<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

370
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,359
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost recovery figure out what's a bit</font>

371
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:10,560
bar and throw some hand and do the rest

372
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:13,180
of that the rest of this piece so

373
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,779
probably it's an interesting exercise

374
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,550
but you may not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by hand</font>

375
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:20,260
but it's still a really great tool and

376
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,329
you can learn a lot by looking at the

377
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,430
spectrum and trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out clock</font>

378
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:27,489
cycles<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll figure I'll explain what I</font>

379
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,229
mean by talking a little bit so the next

380
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">step is demodulation and this is a</font>

381
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,990
really kind of confusing flowchart and I

382
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,250
want to kind of say right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I did</font>

383
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,160
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this flowchart I</font>

384
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,870
actually Mike augment<font color="#CCCCCC"> well think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

385
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,120
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one who gave me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

386
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,920
and i modified it to my needs and that's

387
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,029
kind of something I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

388
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,279
stress is that there's a lot of help a

389
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:52,870
lot of people who really want to

390
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,459
encourage individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into this</font>

391
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,320
area and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help them with the work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

392
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:58,449
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do so there's not you</font>

393
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to come up with everything on</font>

394
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:03,069
your own so for a sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's what</font>

395
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,540
the Beaufort Sea<font color="#E5E5E5"> this trouble again</font>

396
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,579
right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font>

397
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're sending at the right sample rate</font>

398
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,490
and members of translating closer so

399
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,250
that the filter does is if you remember

400
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,290
I had the 914 megahertz was my Center

401
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,140
signal right but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in 9 15</font>

402
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,309
so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was shipped kind of the surface of</font>

403
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,020
the signal and then it rolled through a

404
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:24,819
low pass filter and say I only want to

405
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,079
look at this part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequently come</font>

406
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,250
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest you don't</font>

407
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,168
want to analyze the rescue don't care

408
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:33,250
you only are interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

409
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:36,060
particular signal and so the orange is

410
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:39,400
actually what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does is it breaks</font>

411
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,190
so remote into different first packets

412
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,470
for each first has its own file and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

413
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">birth what if this was if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you remember</font>

414
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,690
from the in spectrum graph you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

415
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,250
there was an audio signal right that's

416
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:55,990
ok signal well the rest of the signals

417
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,120
is not interesting right it's nothing

418
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,440
being sent and you don't worry you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

419
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,780
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that incorporated into your</font>

420
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,430
analysis as much as possible so what

421
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,160
this does and this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

422
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:08,890
creepiest that Mikey I'd a man and I'll

423
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,610
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> later why this virus is</font>

424
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:14,080
necessary is that this you can reverse

425
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,260
and generally a packet and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

426
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,740
packet so we're dividing it up into

427
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:23,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">packet in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the file and then six about</font>

428
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,810
green sauce is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> demodulation right</font>

429
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:29,920
like this is a demodulation slide but

430
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:31,120
like the demodulation boxes ones over

431
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,700
there what they were a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit you</font>

432
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,020
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some processing and dealing</font>

433
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,670
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signal in order to get there</font>

434
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,280
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing you may notice is</font>

435
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,740
foreign demodulating FSK but the bracket

436
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,940
self says quadrature demodulation or its

437
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,830
quadrature du monde so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you would</font>

438
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,960
kind of figure this out so in all

439
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,060
familiar i mean if UD SP reason why but

440
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,920
you would just say you would just do oh

441
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,899
I want to use the new radio to

442
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,610
demodulate FSK and you'll find out

443
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,740
everyone's like oh just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the quarter</font>

444
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:03,729
TC modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you would</font>

445
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:06,580
want to put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of signal so the</font>

446
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,050
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step is this line decoding and if</font>

447
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,730
you remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Manchester and you don't</font>

448
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,960
really know me to know and much about

449
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,180
Manchester I mean you can look that up

450
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,550
but the important piece to understand

451
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,010
about Manchester is that you need a

452
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:21,190
clock to generate manage Manchester and

453
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:23,410
so we need to do the reverse you need to

454
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">recover the cloth to be able to properly</font>

455
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,020
decode a Manchester and encoded signal

456
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,320
so clock recovery is actually probably

457
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,520
one of those difficult areas the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PSP</font>

458
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,520
there's actually a block what you can

459
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,870
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> for getting radio but I've heard</font>

460
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,330
kinds of complaints about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's very</font>

461
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to use and people have a hard</font>

462
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,030
time with it so you know I could have

463
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,520
struggled through that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> impossible no</font>

464
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,980
been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it turns</font>

465
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,620
out that my god men who I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

466
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,540
before actually wrote a program that

467
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,939
would do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me and that's why that</font>

468
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,440
that other demodulation chart was so

469
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,150
complicated because we wanted to get

470
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,680
first with data because these file

471
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,720
different files is an individual burst

472
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,250
and they leave the right was he had a

473
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,430
Python scripts and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adele about</font>

474
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,380
github that basically takes in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

475
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:17,820
and we'll do the clock recovery and

476
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:22,260
Whitney see Manchester<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit it takes a</font>

477
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,659
while to run but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great it's</font>

478
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,070
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the analysis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

479
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,250
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stepping through at the time I</font>

480
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,139
was kind of stuck and at between radio

481
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments last year he presented this to</font>

482
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,210
and I was like that's what I need so

483
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:40,590
save me a lot of effort and it's a

484
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:43,830
really great tool if if you're doing

485
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:46,649
this kind of analysis so you have the

486
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,720
proper covering cool we get there this

487
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,520
outs and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do so</font>

488
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,740
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said you want to get</font>

489
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,710
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this packet data and if you give</font>

490
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,960
your information gathering hopefully you

491
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,870
you got a format of some sort so it's

492
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,140
the thing about the floor mats and going

493
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">from you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the decoded bit and to</font>

494
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,140
format it so it's not really

495
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,320
straightforward it can be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

496
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,430
daunting task but you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">are more comfortable now that you have a</font>

498
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:16,650
bit you can manipulate them and do

499
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:20,190
things with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for me I'm this part kind</font>

500
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:22,160
of scares<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a bit and I mean and I kind</font>

501
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,780
of knew from looking at the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

502
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:29,760
what I gather the information I gathered

503
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:32,550
did not seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit quite what I what I</font>

504
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,690
was saying in the output<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the clock</font>

505
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:39,030
recovery program so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out someone</font>

506
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,420
has already done an analysis on the

507
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:44,070
protocol I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at and I had</font>

508
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered this play during my data</font>

509
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,340
gathering I tried to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this</font>

511
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:54,780
this is def con and this would actually

512
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,790
live decode<font color="#CCCCCC"> just protocol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

513
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,500
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use spr pick it up and decode it</font>

514
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,540
and just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right out</font>

515
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,090
and I couldn't get to work I tried and

516
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,810
just there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something about it that</font>

517
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:09,330
didn't work with my my hardware so I

518
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:11,700
said it applied but once I had Mike

519
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,280
Ottomans work I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say wait a</font>

520
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,950
second that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Manchester encoder bit those</font>

521
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,889
look like the input into part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his</font>

522
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,320
part of his tool so I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

523
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:25,680
back and not you know professor but you

524
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,590
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it to extract the packet</font>

525
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,780
information i was looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

526
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,870
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> really important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as</font>

527
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,410
just before is that yes I could have

528
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,629
probably struggled and done it myself

529
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:42,800
it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible but more and more</font>

530
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:45,750
as the SDR community grows people are

531
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,040
doing this research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and crippling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

532
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,780
protocols and finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out information</font>

533
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,220
and there's a good chance that someone

534
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,620
who's already looked at the protocol

535
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,710
you're interested in and doing that

536
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">search will kind of give you those those</font>

birth lines information to start with

538
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,070
and even if you can't you know run their

539
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,379
code maybe there's pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> leftover</font>

540
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,580
you can realize somewhere else to be

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,750
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information that you</font>

RF right with this information that's

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,480
favorite is the radio but there's a

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,220
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different mailing list that you</font>

can reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say listen I've tried</font>

566
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:14,070
individuals to join and learn and our

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,020
where the proposal doesn't need to be an

573
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,940
overwhelming task everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I did</font>

574
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,710
of course you could get some traction

575
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,750
and people do it but at the same time

576
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,630
there's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much work out there right now</font>

577
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,700
and and in the recent years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

578
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,350
kind of exploded<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the number of</font>

people doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in this area so</font>

580
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chance that whatever you</font>

head with those lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you to begin</font>

583
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:54,110
off of and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I wanted took my artists</font>

584
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,659
pepper guides that I recommend in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

585
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,428
tons more but Martin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moone in that night</font>

586
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:01,740
there's a great positive chi minh con

587
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:03,840
this year that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

588
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,480
I gave but they have their own version

589
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:11,220
for their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on on this process</font>

590
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,990
and it's like learning without how other

591
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,640
people go about their analyses and yet

592
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,679
and we're gonna wear this<font color="#CCCCCC"> oils are great</font>

593
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,500
if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and check those out and I know</font>

594
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,539
that the King radio community is always

595
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,710
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> input so if you you don't</font>

596
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,780
need look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this tutorial they're like</font>

597
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,730
okay you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should explain this more</font>

598
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,799
or you know I'm looking for information

599
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:35,549
about this I'm sure they would

600
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:38,330
appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of feedback so with</font>

601
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:38,330
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a burning question</font>

602
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:13,240
yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see I honestly don't remember</font>

603
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,950
because every time I use this fi RS out

604
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,390
there I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go we look up how to use</font>

605
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,390
it again and there's great tutorials

606
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:55,930
yeah yep yeah so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good question</font>

607
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,760
so my recommendation would be to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

608
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:00,160
RFC LSP are and there's different

609
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,320
versions of it and it's relatively

610
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">inexpensive i think twenty thirty bucks</font>

611
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,040
on amazon and for the software actually

612
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">i forgot to mention agony radium</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

613
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,940
looking really alive CD that you can

614
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,500
download<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use and you plug it in and</font>

615
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,090
you cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting it has a lot of the</font>

616
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,850
things already installed ability to your

617
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,860
ex is there and I think future ex for me

618
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,540
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said everyone's a little bit</font>

619
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,580
different but future us<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is one</font>

620
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,740
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easiest programs to just look at</font>

621
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:32,919
the spectrum initially before you start

622
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:34,510
to manipulate it in any<font color="#CCCCCC"> way yeah kubica</font>

623
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,820
Sarah I haven't got to play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

624
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:42,060
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know yes there are other fans of</font>

625
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:45,240
it so like I said everyone has their own

626
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,240
set up

627
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:54,230
so they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will generally use is</font>

628
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:59,210
mr unlicensed band so 915 is pretty

629
00:27:54,230 --> 00:28:01,670
popular like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first 30 megahert 2.4</font>

630
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,360
gigahertz so kind of like the Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> band</font>

631
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:09,880
and bluetooth is up there as well what

632
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:14,479
oh yes I big ahead is also the new Wi-Fi

633
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:19,420
are extremely unlicensed and so those

634
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,420
are generally the ranges that you'll see

635
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,830
yeah you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be careful when you're</font>

636
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,410
when you're transmitting to have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

637
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:44,389
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boundaries are for allowable</font>

638
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:46,790
frequencies and in power levels yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

639
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:49,670
yeah as you were saying not in the is M

640
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:53,480
bands I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bad idea to have</font>

641
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:56,240
one but yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

642
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">just do your research and figure out</font>

643
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,980
what is allowed but I have some bands at

644
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:08,830
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower power level generally you're</font>

645
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:08,830
okay anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh okay go ahead</font>

646
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:26,449
I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so far I mean</font>

647
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,590
from my experience and it's admittedly

648
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,909
limited if I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single</font>

649
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,709
it's like encrypted to the point that I

650
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:36,320
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything with it I mean I'm</font>

651
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,850
talking about Wi-Fi wpa right like you

652
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,918
can see you can see traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

653
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:44,980
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> information from in a pack of data</font>

654
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:48,770
but in terms of a lot of these signals I

655
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,029
wouldn't like i was saying there's a

656
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,190
good chance that someone has reverse

657
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:57,880
engineered what little encryption there

658
00:29:52,190 --> 00:30:05,950
is on many of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> depends</font>

659
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:05,950
yes yeah

660
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,940
so a little saying those mostly is

661
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:47,680
encoding and not encryption for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

662
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:50,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">these devices so any other questions my</font>

663
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:55,630
favorite ah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I don't like</font>

664
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:58,090
my answer I like Callie I know it's not

665
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:01,180
the favorite of people who do wireless

666
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,770
but it's easy enough to use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

667
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:14,320
me started quick and that's a lot of

668
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">time what I need um so c str sharp is</font>

669
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,389
just is another it's another program so

670
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,040
the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that creates a spy is</font>

671
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,380
actually the same company that creates

672
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">scr sharks and i think i mean i was</font>

673
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,030
using it as like last year i was using

674
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,000
it and it seems to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right i mean</font>

675
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:33,399
fcr sharp actually operates on windows

676
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,110
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't specify what operating</font>

677
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,420
system they work on but you know just

678
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that there are some fo windows as</font>

679
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,000
well if you don't want to sell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

680
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,159
the clinic's realm but i would highly

681
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:54,430
recommend you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at someone</font>

682
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanek schools so yes sir so yeah an RF</font>

683
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:04,540
enclosure is a pretty ice cream<font color="#E5E5E5"> is great</font>

684
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:08,950
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one but I mean so we will</font>

685
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,909
generally use a ramsey box I don't know

686
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,020
if you're familiar with those but I

687
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,780
think there's other companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

688
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,370
similar ones for some of the testing is

689
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,470
something really<font color="#E5E5E5"> small we also recently</font>

690
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:21,699
got an RF pen which I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

691
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend that so very different I can't</font>

692
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:32,020
tell you which to fight out with ya good

693
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:48,970
oh yeah

694
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:50,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good point yeah yeah so so we were</font>

695
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,690
saying there's a you can get a dummy

696
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:56,680
load to kind of prevent any strong

697
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:02,380
emanations from you know beyond your

698
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:11,710
health sir where you are another

699
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:13,390
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sorry I mean I think</font>

700
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:16,950
unless anyone else has any more

701
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,950
questions that will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> end early</font>

702
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:36,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well mark I said sorry so is even</font>

703
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,200
big me I haven't yet gotten to that you

704
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:40,929
have an IOT lab and we're building it up

705
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:44,080
we started with what ended up being a

706
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:47,260
proprietary protocol but we had some

707
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,100
devices and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going</font>

708
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:54,910
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ray's Raven is it Raven aralen</font>

709
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:57,010
the zigbee<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I don't know if anyone</font>

710
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,280
knows but there are specific devices if

711
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,450
you would it through the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> Church for</font>

712
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,850
receiving those and like I mentioned

713
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:07,330
before early<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in the top there are</font>

714
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually like packages for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new radio</font>

715
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:14,199
and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> scr environment to work with</font>

716
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,850
those it just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how much it can</font>

717
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,889
be a learning experience to do that so

718
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,899
you can buy specific hardware or you can

719
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:23,949
try to do it via ser and I do know that

720
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:26,549
there are packages the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigbee lipitor be</font>

721
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:26,549
with one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

722
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,450
yeah so a lot of the wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols</font>

723
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,760
because over the years it's kind of that

724
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:02,399
what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> security through obscurity so</font>

725
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,320
they assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because the protocol</font>

726
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,930
has to be reverse engineered that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

727
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,510
lot harder to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crack it or</font>

728
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">reverse engineer a sedative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and with FDR</font>

729
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,050
and accessible information and you know

730
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,410
the seas are increasing and feasibility

731
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:18,510
is increasing things so rapidly we're

732
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:22,009
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so decisions made</font>

733
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:24,450
in the past about you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is space</font>

734
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,250
may not have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best decision I</font>

735
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">can tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol that I</font>

736
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,540
used as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example well it's kind of an</font>

737
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,720
older protocol right and they just a

738
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:36,509
thought yeah this is fine like three

739
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,359
places whatever reason didn't you know

740
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:42,120
strike them as a problem so things like

741
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that definitely occurrence oh yes so</font>

742
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,799
they try to hide behind proprietary you

743
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,200
know NDA's and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as</font>

744
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,970
you're sure you're finding with<font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font>

745
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,569
within the greater security realm that

746
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,569
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always work</font>

747
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">if there's nothing else I think we're</font>

748
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,109
ending and i'll be around in the

749
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">conference if you have any other</font>

750
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions you wanted to ask me thank you</font>
