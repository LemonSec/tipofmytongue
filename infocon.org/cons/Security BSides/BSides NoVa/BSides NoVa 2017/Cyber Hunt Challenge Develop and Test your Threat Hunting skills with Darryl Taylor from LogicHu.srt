34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:56,820
talking I love cycling once at a whisk

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:18,330
good part and if anybody wants to talk

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:20,010
about cycling after what has it my

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:27,170
favorite thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up this is</font>

42
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:27,170
actually second so you approach so I

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:34,440
want you guys to get it into kind of a

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,170
mindset of i'm giving you day that's all

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm getting today you have to do</font>

46
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,640
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that data what I see too</font>

47
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,890
many times people then going into the

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,769
leap from data do not understand

49
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,529
something and being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it make</font>

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:53,030
it active and so there's a there's a

51
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:58,830
procedure your step in in that shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

52
00:02:53,030 --> 00:03:00,870
used to teach this so I also mentor

53
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">reserve I was an army reservist after I</font>

54
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,820
got all<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of beauty and so I need to</font>

55
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:10,440
teach analysis to them and we sure we

56
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,870
did this over and over again exactly and

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,859
I didn't actually know how to say what I

58
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:20,730
did is processed and so is the process

59
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,160
we step through and you get each

60
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,890
component and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about data and</font>

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,930
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different things but</font>

62
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,140
the main thing is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't just</font>

63
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,829
jump<font color="#CCCCCC"> make indecision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on date and what I</font>

64
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:38,730
see a lot in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the space right now</font>

65
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:42,360
is people making decisions on one

66
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:45,929
dimension they take one thing and they

67
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,970
do one little thing to it oh this is

68
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,190
something and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and do</font>

69
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,760
something about I'm going to go and make

70
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,549
an alert and thousands of alert and then

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,140
people get tired and people turn over

72
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:02,310
people don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be screaming</font>

73
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:05,429
watches or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ortega junkie so then the</font>

74
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,489
thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to go to eat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TV</font>

75
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,190
station and so I'm going to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

76
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,349
example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the pieces of</font>

77
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,500
information that you guys actually will

78
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:19,260
have

79
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:23,500
why do we have here up in your files and

80
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,409
this is a output<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the ethernet</font>

81
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,460
interface and what this output basically

82
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,340
has a nickname<font color="#CCCCCC"> as address all it not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sup</font>

83
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:38,469
transmitted by sweetie pie sure the day

84
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:41,400
no one unless you are raining if you had

85
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,850
if you had all this you could not see

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,140
what would contain it and even work

87
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,220
Kylie and I don't give it to you in this

88
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,110
format<font color="#CCCCCC"> what working with the DoD</font>

89
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,040
everybody likes tricky<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know hey</font>

90
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,680
Gretchen how to totally group people

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,660
call people over you this technology and

92
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,970
busier actually doing something with it

93
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,919
but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just it you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

94
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">give it a text format I'll actually show</font>

95
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:15,099
you that but it's just it so to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the</font>

96
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">information you have to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

97
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to normalize transform it</font>

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,280
do correlations and all I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

99
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:28,210
what I have done for you is I have made

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,489
to raise the data semi information so

101
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,229
all of it is part you're not going to

102
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,630
have to go and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to park it out a</font>

103
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:37,120
figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> column equals what it's</font>

104
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,380
all parts you get it in two formats one

105
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,720
is CSD so x comma comma separated values

106
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,510
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a car in a power and</font>

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,430
then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> j saw both of them</font>

108
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">are derived from slump data so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

109
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,750
downloaded from slump please good luck

110
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,849
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back in look I will</font>

111
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,120
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you do that I had that in</font>

112
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,490
here but we're hoping do that but it's

113
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,580
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> as easy getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it back interest</font>

114
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:06,820
which is kind of weird business up and

115
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,590
and there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did change on but is</font>

116
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,050
the special Jake on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screamin Jay</font>

117
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:15,159
sophomore at least one position which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

118
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,260
every line of data is a JSON object the

119
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,360
whole thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a jay promised so you</font>

120
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,480
try to process it with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> json shot</font>

121
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,840
that's going to play in

122
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,690
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not normal day times but it</font>

123
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,810
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way because when you</font>

124
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,820
strain stuff out it has to be a topical

125
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,830
that one line comes out it has to be a

126
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,900
time or if you have break in it

127
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">something happens to hear all your data</font>

128
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,049
from so that's why it's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way but I</font>

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,180
give it to you semi normal lot more

130
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:48,150
normalized but I don't select<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mia</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">teachers for you I'll tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font>

132
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:54,179
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all you but they give you an</font>

example of that turn it in an invasion

134

I'm and if you guys don't know man on

you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an amorous in model finish</font>

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was a kind of a heart I don't save</font>

142
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:21,059
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for someone reported I'll but I was a</font>

143
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:23,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">little hard on people but when we talk</font>

144
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,040
about when we talk about the speech is

145
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,560
legit those in the data I want to I want

146
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:33,330
to see my heart's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my car key x mark</font>

147
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,460
bike price in my celery and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

148
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">off taken down here it does the math I</font>

149
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,900
don't know if you guys know boss when I

150
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:45,150
dream at it off but after that does but

151
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:47,370
I'm internally correlating so if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font>

152
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">just ran this one I would get income</font>

153
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,740
this column<font color="#CCCCCC"> here this data daytime of</font>

154
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,650
that house if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ran this one I</font>

155
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:00,870
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> get this column here they charge</font>

156
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:04,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">at what I but what I need is because I'm</font>

157
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:08,000
only only again or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ladies pieces up what</font>

158
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:13,860
I need is both components and so this

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,050
ugly one here and if anybody is freely

160
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,630
available you guys can use if you want

161
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the data but</font>

162
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:24,990
what i'm doing here is doing the math to

163
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,850
subtract this one call from up on a

164
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,699
previous blog from the next shuttle on

165
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,919
and use it

166
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,690
and you look at anything oh man I got a

167
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,750
lot of life here got a lot of life here

168
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,279
oh and I got a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of life here but not</font>

169
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,740
that meaning here something's wrong

170
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:45,360
right there right mmm something is

171
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">different that's right something is</font>

172
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,089
different but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know right</font>

173
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,700
knowledge question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analyzed</font>

174
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:56,700
organized you have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and say okay</font>

175
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,490
I think I know something I can postulate

176
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:04,110
but I'll you know how do I you know it

177
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:06,930
and so which one of the things i use the

178
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">hate over one of these I mean when</font>

179
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,969
people created visualize these videos

180
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,550
ation I hate that word it is open

181
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:19,440
overused word but in certain

182
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:24,120
circumstances there are useful very

183
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,779
useful out there is a need for

184
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:32,580
visualization so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business of</font>

185
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:36,390
it seems like here great the steam pipe

186
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,640
isn't the transient part now you notice

187
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's a periodicity to transmit</font>

188
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,110
light right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> DISA tea and that</font>

189
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">periodicity when we call that share the</font>

190
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,360
path of the ball on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deep over</font>

191
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,250
when the other team fighting so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

192
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,380
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> line if you had looked at it just</font>

193
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,300
in another selfie with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it oh that's what</font>

194
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,790
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> against but you didn't</font>

195
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">have all of the information to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

196
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,150
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that judgment so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

197
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,870
looking at it in a different way helps

198
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,810
you with that so now we look back again

199
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,670
we say all that's a jump this one might

200
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:19,140
not be is important this was so now we

201
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:22,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that this is normal this is you</font>

202
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,160
have them so thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that in</font>

203
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,660
going from that one layer to the next

204
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,819
layer but now you still don't

205
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,270
necessarily understand what's going on

206
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,279
hi so one of the things that when I need

207
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run that organization one of the</font>

208
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,730
things work can use it

209
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,800
can you defend because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

210
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,830
evaluate<font color="#E5E5E5"> your second offense can you</font>

211
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,410
actually defend what you're telling show

212
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,630
me so when you guys do the time of my

213
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,050
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can tell me all kinds of</font>

214
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,960
things but if you don't show me you

215
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:59,380
don't get point you have to actually say

216
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,880
it happened because of this I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it</font>

217
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,110
right here daytime etc so you will have

218
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,000
and again i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go over the rules</font>

219
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,490
in just a second but I'm just presenting

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,920
this so that you guys understand the

221
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,880
kind of thinking I'm looking for for you

222
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,310
to proper to say is actually not<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's</font>

223
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,160
mixed it intermingle data right so you

224
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,469
have event this event type that it meant

225
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,980
either probably 16 different event types

226
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,870
in this a you have the part of your

227
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,930
challenge is even pulling those event

228
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,210
types of markets isolated so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

229
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,130
types reducing those event I making

230
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,080
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those event type and then</font>

231
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:41,260
correlating those event types with other

232
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,880
than yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you use you</font>

233
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,700
can use command line I can do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

234
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,870
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a phone a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command line you can</font>

235
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:52,540
use long I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help you to do that you</font>

236
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,089
can use in type of Python you can use

237
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,410
any coding program I will help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

238
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:01,600
also though the last one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with</font>

239
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,000
with them off on the get your comment

240
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,040
district blossoms window you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,720
after doing this over and over again the

242
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,660
senior analyst just knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he can</font>

243
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at stuff and it's correlated ye is</font>

244
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:17,079
this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> alone but it's not always</font>

245
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:25,390
intuitive to those of us who don't do

246
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:29,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and off it now New York had one so</font>

247
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:35,189
when I keeps it normally we use a what I

248
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:40,029
call a blue logic fiesta going to python

249
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:42,670
so we have a version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python on there</font>

250
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,410
that actually has all the pandas library

251
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,979
all of the machine learning libraries

252
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,519
that you

253
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,800
would want to ever have mostly that is a

254
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,139
wreath of reversion there's actually a

255
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,899
painful emergence the action that gives

256
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:59,920
you more<font color="#E5E5E5"> library to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use but</font>

257
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:03,370
again that's just the amazings of which

258
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,579
you are if you like to pull data<font color="#CCCCCC"> depart</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">in art is there a long else this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log in</font>

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:11,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">G in Terminator</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ice pulmonary page it's</font>

262
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,850
already know how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this with my turn</font>

263
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,310
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it allows you to separate the</font>

264
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,529
terminals asian have four or more

265
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,359
terminals right there and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

266
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,850
the same thing across all terminals or

267
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,149
or do different things into trouble so

268
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:32,620
press that but anyway going back to this

269
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:35,440
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> days that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm being nice i'm only</font>

393
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">not here and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the opposite analysis</font>

394
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,840
there was a very glaring I don't know

395
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,560
how this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what is a glaring omission</font>

396
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:27,120
ncfc kiss where if you if you pull out

397

all the column you going to see Andy I

398
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,250

you with those blank house well see if

402
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,410
teach it doesn't have a way to deal with

403
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that far wrote something to deal with it</font>

404
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:46,380
and it's included in your stuff but you

405
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,820
need you need to let your<font color="#CCCCCC"> library but if</font>

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,169
understand that actually being able to

412

you to get it to look right you actually

454
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:12,730
have to run a Rex command to replace the

455
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,520
new line with it really line and that

456
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:18,250
makes the data look perfect and then you

457
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,070
just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tumult ekv and the multi</font>

00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,690
and a whole bunch of data in column well

463
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,850
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the perfect candidate for that</font>

464
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,010
because we really important<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>
