1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:11,519
the b-sides Nova 20/20 stream will begin

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:12,989
momentarily I speed low drag that's

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,039
about what we're about to experience

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,359
here so bear with me please they are

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,460
going to be recording this so if you

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:33,870
want to play it back at half speed that

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:35,610
may help now normally I would I would

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,290
stay around and answer questions but I'm

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,540
actually heading immediately from here

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,500
to the airport because tomorrow morning

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,329
I speak in beside San Diego because it

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,190
wasn't enough just to do one side at a

13
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,590
time but if you have questions in the

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,959
end this is my Twitter feel free to

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,180
reach out to me so we'll just put that

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,620
out there early here plus I can always

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,300
use more followers alright how many here

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,750
just out of curiosity how many here is

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,060
this your first b-sides okay we got

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:12,390
quite a few here how about first b-sides

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:15,360
Nova okay yeah this is always a great

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,040
event it really is these guys do a

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,659
fantastic job of putting this together

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,670
if you all have ever been involved in an

25
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,060
event like this you know it is a very

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,110
tricky thing with a lot of moving parts

27
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,369
especially there's this little illness

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,360
going around that's got everyone a

29
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,360
little freaked out right

30
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,039
I'm sure they had to deal with a bit of

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,259
that let me know when we're ready to go

32
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,560
and we're good to go all right here we

33
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,909
go

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,409
like I said folks this is gonna be

35
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,450
high-speed low-drag we're gonna talk

36
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:42,100
about deep fakes though how many people

37
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,979
here have experience with deep fakes

38
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,658
already okay got a couple of hands here

39
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,479
all right so we're gonna move into that

40
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:50,979
a little bit about me yes I'm old worked

41
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:55,329
for the Army for about ten years as a

42
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:58,350
contractor also with is C squared etc

43
00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:00,339
etc been in a lot of different fields

44
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,348
I've always been very passionate about

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,750
the human element which is what this

46
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:06,520
deals with a lot I work for know before

47
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:11,130
we're out of Tampa where it is yes much

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,030
warmer than here I will tell you we do

49
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,250
security awareness training and

50
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,260
simulated fishing that's what we do we

51
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,760
deal with scams a lot and that's really

52
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,660
what the deep fakes are coming down to

53
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,548
is a scam side of things so that's

54
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,380
enough about us again we're moving real

55
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,910
fast here we're gonna talk about how it

56
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,730
got started progression to deep fakes

57
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,920
potential impact etc etc now I will tell

58
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,780
you my background a lot I did a lot in

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,720
photography as well so I do stock

60
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,850
photography I used to do sports events

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,799
mostly cycling or motorcycle racing

62
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,780
photography things like that I actually

63
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:46,660
got into digital imaging when I was in

64
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,220
the Navy which got me into computers one

65
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,739
of the guys in my ship I was on the USS

66
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,630
America he had an Amiga 500 if you all

67
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,190
remember what those are and he showed me

68
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,739
this really cool thing where you could

69
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,480
scan pictures in by taking this handheld

70
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,639
scanner clicking a button and then you

71
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,138
rolled the thing anyone here ever work

72
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,810
with one of those right that is old

73
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,730
school that's how old I am folks okay it

74
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,139
was a handheld scanner but it got me

75
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,090
really interested in computers and

76
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:12,040
that's kind of what drove into it but

77
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,590
I've been involved in digital imaging

78
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,019
for a long time it's what made deep

79
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,209
fakes really kind of stand out to me so

80
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,859
how this all got started well this talk

81
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,220
actually got started because a friend of

82
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,010
mine

83
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,769
Javad Malik he's in the UK he's one of

84
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,780
my colleagues too we got into things a

85
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:31,620
little bit in our whatsapp and what we

86
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,750
started doing was we started kind of

87
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,479
copying pasting photoshopping our

88
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,840
conversations into something that was

89
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,730
not what we had said at all okay

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
finally what we ended up doing we

91
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,040
achieved mutually assured destruction

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,739
from an HR standpoint where we knew that

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,870
the things that we had made it look like

94
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,569
each other said would probably ruin us

95
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,209
both but we realized in the course of

96
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,619
doing that how this could really be used

97
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,349
against you and that's what kind of

98
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,780
spurred us into this talk about deep

99
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:06,089
fakes and how it all kind of started and

100
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,830
what what it's going to now so

101
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,739
progression of deep fakes

102
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,540
this is Javad start start shallow goes

103
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,489
deep right top to bottom and basically

104
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,810
what this boils down to is you start

105
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,048
looking at deep fakes when you start

106
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,430
dealing with the AI stuff now simplicity

107
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,440
reasons you know you start over here

108
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,990
with the static stuff move over to

109
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,330
dynamic right so shallow stuff text

110
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,610
manipulation photo editing doing your

111
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,500
Photoshop stuff like that right coming

112
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,710
on over here anyone remember the JibJab

113
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,030
style little videos right okay yeah so

114
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,109
around Christmas you paste somebody's

115
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,840
face on that and they're dancing around

116
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,820
as elves that's not really a I type

117
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,710
stuff but it is getting into dynamic

118
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,780
sort of things you get into the Face

119
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,299
Swap stuff and puppetry over here and

120
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,679
the really deep stuff this person does

121
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,850
not exist how many of you have seen

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,880
those pictures where the AI has actually

123
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,470
generated humans right and some of those

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,360
are pretty some of those are pretty

125
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,880
creepy right but some of them actually

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,260
look pretty realistic that's kind of

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,159
what we're talking about here across

128
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,950
this spread

129
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,300
now image manipulation starts off with

130
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,150
doing things like removing people from

131
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,650
busy the locations tilt shift photos

132
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,900
force perspective I'll show you some of

133
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,280
that this is image stacking in Photoshop

134
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,690
this is something I used to have to do

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,549
basically you go out here to one of the

136
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,410
monuments set up your camera and you

137
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,479
take a bunch of pictures over a short

138
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,160
amount of time and then as people move

139
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,469
through there you basically stack these

140
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,690
images and take the people out right now

141
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,090
Photoshop comes with this filter by

142
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,740
default now it comes with it you just go

143
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,869
okay and you take all those pictures and

144
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,099
it does it all by itself but basically

145
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,690
what you can do is you can take

146
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,630
something like this and remove people

147
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,520
from that which if you start thinking

148
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,960
about that you could now remove people

149
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,810
from places that they might have been

150
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,219
before making people wonder if they're

151
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,360
telling the truth right this is one of

152
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:54,460
the things but this is static stuff

153
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,530
it's pretty amazing to me that this kind

154
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,049
of stuff has happened where it comes

155
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,210
with Photoshop already it's easy to do

156
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,080
any of you do it you click a script and

157
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,870
you're done

158
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,639
next step is tilt-shift images this is

159
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,099
actually a drone shot this is a real

160
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,469
picture this is designed to make real

161
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:14,620
things look fake they work well at like

162
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:16,300
45-degree angles basically you blur out

163
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,289
some of the stuff there and pop up your

164
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,300
contrast and your color saturation

165
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:24,250
that looks very fake doesn't it but it's

166
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,469
a real picture so again it's a type of

167
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,710
manipulation that messes with you and

168
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,969
you could do things like that as well

169
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,008
how many of you seen these the force

170
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:35,680
perspective right biggest dog ever

171
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,990
coming at you there this is all about

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,020
angles and perspectives right we've seen

173
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,430
it a while back they they used to have

174
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,318
the pictures of the guys holding out the

175
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,659
camel spider made it look like this

176
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,009
giant gigantic spider but that's a

177
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,779
perspective thing by holding it away

178
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,180
from you and the photo taken there

179
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:54,039
you're starting to change how things

180
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,210
actually are I do love the picture of

181
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:59,318
the dog that would be the biggest dog

182
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,669
ever but it's a lot of fun again this is

183
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,620
all different ways to do some

184
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:04,900
manipulation this doesn't even involve

185
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,599
digital manipulation it's simply how the

186
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,388
lenses bring in light and make things

187
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,529
look now FaceTime swaps and app filters

188
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,060
we're get to the point that a lot of

189
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,190
this stuff happens on our phones in

190
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,599
fairly real-time and that's pretty

191
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,129
amazing if you think about what we're

192
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,089
carrying in our back pockets these days

193
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,580
and the sorts of things that are

194
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:23,110
happening it's pretty wild we can add

195
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,270
cat ears how many of you remember the

196
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,279
age app right that was kind of spooky

197
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,889
yes all your information went to Russia

198
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,539
but whatever face swapping apps making

199
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,750
animals talk these things are all

200
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:38,378
happening on our cell phones which is

201
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,729
pretty wild so there can be problems

202
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,789
with that you guys see this I think this

203
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:44,889
was the Pakistani Prime Minister and

204
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,870
another one just recently happened to

205
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,779
where they accidentally left on

206
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,800
basically these funny over it this was a

207
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:56,169
live broadcast though it's actually a

208
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,639
really powerful technology to have on

209
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,359
your phones it's pretty amazing when we

210
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:04,389
think about that so

211
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,810
what's that advocating for mice right

212
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,040
yeah can you imagine I mean the poor

213
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,389
person that's doing this first of all

214
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,940
don't you look at your phone when you're

215
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,470
like doing a live broadcast of like the

216
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,960
prime minister or something I would

217
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,550
think that you would look but anyways my

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,680
talking pet how many of you have seen

219
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:25,900
this you can make the pet talk right so

220
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,540
you take a picture of a pet you upload

221
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,669
it there and now your pet speaks these

222
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,070
words and what's interesting is you know

223
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:35,199
it moves the mouse and it actually it

224
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,550
moves the eyebrows it moves the ears it

225
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,919
moves all kinds of stuff like that

226
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,260
where what kind of world did I grow up

227
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,429
in that we didn't have this right this

228
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,430
is some pretty amazing stuff here

229
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,170
although again if you think about it

230
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,550
this is some pretty powerful stuff that

231
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,120
we have in the palm of our hands when it

232
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,949
comes to manipulating things like this

233
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,260
when we get into video deep fake - this

234
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,490
is where it gets kind of fun so I've

235
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,779
been doing this I've been playing with

236
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,190
this a little bit I got a short clip we

237
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:05,730
can look at here deep fake apps this is

238
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,560
where you're getting into things like

239
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,110
replacing the face of one person with

240
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,380
another okay typically deep fake apps

241
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,000
they're gonna work on most of them are

242
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,740
working on tensorflow as a back-end for

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,020
the AI most of them are GPU centric so

244
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,060
you have to have a good graphics card in

245
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,279
order to do this most of the time

246
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,709
Invidia is the graphics card of choice

247
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,290
I've done it both on AMD and NVIDIA

248
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,420
sides the Nvidia Tsar more supported

249
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,550
although there are ways to do it off

250
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,490
there basically when you take a deep

251
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,459
fake app what it does is we all know

252
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:46,029
that a video is a series of still photos

253
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:49,300
right so 29.97 frames per second for

254
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:51,640
ntsc basically about 30 30 frames per

255
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,550
second and what it does is it extracts

256
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,650
those out so they're separate and then

257
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,930
you use AI to go in and it's going to

258
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,490
identify the faces okay so it's going to

259
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,890
use algorithms it's going to use its

260
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,480
magic of AI and it's gonna find all

261
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,810
these things and usually cuts out about

262
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,580
120 by 120 pixels square okay

263
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,869
so now what it's gonna do is gonna take

264
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,330
that information you got to do some

265
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,490
manual clean-up on it

266
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,670
but then what it's gonna do is it's

267
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,590
going to look for that and it's gonna

268
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,479
build a model based on what you have

269
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,550
there and then you can easily take it

270
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,710
from another video where it basically

271
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,199
does the same thing extracting those and

272
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,750
now it merges these two through the AI

273
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,810
and then replaces it on all those frames

274
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,910
and then it stitches it all back

275
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,819
together just like it was before now

276
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,529
this is a lot of work frankly and it's

277
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,810
something that if we were to do it

278
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:46,300
manually it is possible but it's gonna

279
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,739
take a lot of time okay so that's the

280
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,589
beauty of these apps as they do it very

281
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,830
very quickly now the limitations is a

282
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:56,470
deep fake video apps is they don't

283
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,850
modify the audio so typically speaking

284
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,920
if you want to make a really convincing

285
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,880
one what you're gonna have to do is

286
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,130
you're actually gonna have to turn

287
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,020
around and have a voiceover actor so

288
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,480
when we've seen the fakes where they

289
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,550
really try to fake everything and say

290
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,290
different things you need a voiceover

291
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,550
actor otherwise it's going to be the

292
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,790
words that they're saying but with a

293
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,650
different face the one I've used most is

294
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,740
called deep face lab it's available here

295
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:24,819
from github there's windows binaries

296
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,730
downloadable for it and basically it's

297
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,320
pretty easy to use it's actually very

298
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,760
easy to use I'm going to show you

299
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,150
something I did right here hopefully

300
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,150
it'll play

301
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
so yeah there's not much in the way of

302
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,740
audio on this I mean you can hear him

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
talk but this is basically a

304
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,120
before-and-after so what I did is I took

305
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,450
a person from Spiceworks

306
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,810
his name is just an dong here and I

307
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:53,150
actually put Elon Musk's face on top

308
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,579
okay and if you look at it you you can

309
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:57,380
actually tell the difference is okay

310
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,910
it's somewhat subtle and I found that

311
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,630
this works better if the basic face

312
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:06,740
shape is the same and if they don't have

313
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,540
beards okay I have had a hell of a time

314
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,370
getting through beards or facial hair it

315
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,880
doesn't work quite as well but you can

316
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,480
see here if you what's that right there

317
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,850
you go

318
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,410
I'll tell you to feed this folks but if

319
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,930
you look here it's actually replaced the

320
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,430
mouth on both of these the nose is

321
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,979
different the eyes are obviously

322
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,540
different but you still get Iblees you

323
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,000
still get all that kind of stuff

324
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,079
that makes it look like it's a human

325
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,160
okay

326
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,290
now to give you an idea what this took

327
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,770
this took on my laptop which does have a

328
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:43,640
dedicated GPU it's a gaming laptop this

329
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:45,920
took about 12 hours or so for the AI to

330
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,010
learn this I probably spent about

331
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,000
another two hours or so taking it apart

332
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,800
full video clip ran I think I ended up

333
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,200
pulling about two three minutes out of

334
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,459
this so the fact is though it doesn't

335
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,800
take that much time and I didn't do any

336
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:06,920
customizing to this this was just the

337
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,109
basic out-of-the-box settings when it

338
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,599
came to this and you know it's pretty

339
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,130
wild to see how well this works I didn't

340
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,900
really mean to restart that but what the

341
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:19,400
hell right so again now you're gonna get

342
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,930
blurs you're gonna get some things that

343
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,310
are gonna happen here some artifacts

344
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,810
here and that's important later on

345
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,969
you'll see in this cheek it happens a

346
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,859
couple times here but overall I mean

347
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,980
what do you guys think for free software

348
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,170
and about you know 12 hours or 14 hours

349
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,640
worth of it but it's pretty amazing the

350
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,920
things that you can do here I've seen

351
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,319
far far worse out there

352
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,329
free app though that's the that's the

353
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,850
interesting thing about this now on the

354
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,769
other side there are audio deep fake

355
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,459
apps as well these are

356
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:52,220
on github as well same thing uses a GPU

357
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:56,388
is tensorflow on the backend in order to

358
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,970
recreate or to create sounds based on

359
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:01,399
learning from one sound so you feed it

360
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,129
you know 15 30 seconds or so of

361
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,259
somebody's talking and that's what he

362
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:09,559
uses now when you speak through the

363
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:13,160
software it changes that and I've seen

364
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:16,189
it do accents I've seen it do all kinds

365
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,790
of stuff now I will say this at this

366
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:20,449
moment it sucks it's pretty easy to tell

367
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,959
ok

368
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:26,748
it really is but what's interesting to

369
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:30,410
me on this is how much work they're

370
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:31,610
doing to perfect this so this is one

371
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,799
right here if you guys want to play

372
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,290
around again free on github this is

373
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,389
called real-time voice cloning what's

374
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,368
interesting about this is not a day goes

375
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:43,040
by that I'm not getting alerts from

376
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:46,850
github about people posing questions

377
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:50,480
comments it is a very very active thing

378
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,549
it's Python based and it does help

379
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,209
because it uses pre train models to help

380
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:57,949
speed up the implementation again I've

381
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,829
heard some things out of this it is

382
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:03,139
still humanly recognizable in most cases

383
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,540
that it's been modified there's still

384
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,389
that kind of synthetic weird sound that

385
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,699
we get sometimes with you know voicemail

386
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:12,139
systems or voice prompt systems you can

387
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:15,559
always kind of tell a little bit that

388
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:19,420
it's been digitized but I started

389
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:23,569
playing with this six seven months ago

390
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,459
it has really really improved how well

391
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:27,378
it's doing just in that short amount of

392
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,479
time so it is something to keep an eye

393
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:34,699
on again what's amazing about this stuff

394
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,589
is it's all free so potential impacts

395
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,199
well we know that all warfare is based

396
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:40,369
on deception

397
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:42,319
what's a security conference without a

398
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:44,360
Sun Zoo slide right come on we got to

399
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,639
have at least one gratuitous Sun Zoo

400
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,389
slide in here it's a fairly new book

401
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,429
might have heard of it art of war ok but

402
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:55,669
it's true it is true and there is a lot

403
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:57,290
of warfare going on here it's you know

404
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:59,089
the attacks we're seeing the the

405
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,520
breaches we're seeing nation-states were

406
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:01,410
seeing or

407
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,590
nice crime we're seeing all kinds of

408
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:07,800
stuff involved in here business email

409
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:10,170
compromised being a big one here I would

410
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,050
like you to transfer a bunch of money so

411
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:15,420
on so forth I'm whatever this is a prime

412
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,620
case for this being used right what if

413
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,000
you get that email and it's from the

414
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,070
boss and it says hey I want you to

415
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,540
transfer a million dollars you pick up

416
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,640
the phone you call the number in there

417
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,560
and it sounds like your boss right yes

418
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm confirming quit bugging me right

419
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,150
that's a prime use for something like

420
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,280
this and we tell people pick up the

421
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,530
phone call them and get the answer well

422
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,680
this kind of defeats that as we move

423
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:40,500
forward we have to understand the root

424
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,569
of deception our brains our brains

425
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,100
actually apply filters to what we see

426
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,860
hear smell taste and touch and I do

427
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,050
whole talks on this it fascinates me the

428
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,790
psychology behind this but if you don't

429
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,150
think your brain applies filters to

430
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,469
things when you're looking over here if

431
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,120
you look to the side do you see your

432
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,800
nose without looking for it like if

433
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,210
you're not actually thinking about your

434
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,099
nose you don't see your nose in your

435
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,980
line of vision why because your brain

436
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,970
filters that out okay the brains an

437
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,670
amazing thing

438
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,819
what color was the dress right or the

439
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,530
shoes or all of those are your brain

440
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,780
filtering certain things out and

441
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,970
applying reality well when you start

442
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,790
tweaking the inputs to that through deep

443
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,730
phase it becomes much easier now to

444
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,520
trick people into doing certain things

445
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:30,900
or seeing what they expect

446
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,330
so video or faked photo fakes where can

447
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,070
they could be used romance scams how

448
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,550
many of you have heard of those any of

449
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,580
you had anyone impacted by romance scams

450
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:43,230
right if you have you know that you know

451
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,730
this is somebody pretending to be

452
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,950
someone else of course they're always a

453
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:52,680
doctor or a pilot or something crazy

454
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:55,470
right but what happens is you want to

455
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,390
try to help these people by saying have

456
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,830
them do something right so if you're if

457
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,200
you if you have a loved one doing that

458
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,750
you say have them hold up a coffee cup

459
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,330
with their pinkie sticking out right or

460
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,130
have them touch their nose and send you

461
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,409
a picture or a video or something like

462
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,400
that those are kind of proof of life

463
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,559
sorts of things that we do

464
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,630
with deep fakes you would be able to

465
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,360
have the person act that way and then

466
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,910
place that other person because a lot of

467
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,699
times they go for celebrities and now

468
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,920
you place that person on them and have

469
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,840
them doing the action right so we can

470
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,710
actually make those things more

471
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:35,949
realistic or more verifiable imagine

472
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:38,950
outrage clickbait okay so you have a

473
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,840
video out there that's like you won't

474
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,750
believe so and so did this now I don't

475
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,909
know if you all realize this in the area

476
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:49,390
but politics these days is a little bit

477
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,520
you know tense right and there may or

478
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,400
may not be an election coming up right

479
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,940
so what happens if you take something

480
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,090
and you build a video that has a

481
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,890
candidate saying something completely

482
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:06,970
outlandish or outrageous a couple days

483
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:08,470
before everyone's due to vote right you

484
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,970
can actually cause some problems with

485
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,590
that because now these people go out

486
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,929
there and they you know they're gonna

487
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,020
vote eventually it's disproved but by

488
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,760
that time it may be too late okay and

489
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,110
that's one of the issues I think that

490
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,780
we're gonna be facing here and this is

491
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,969
actually pretty scary for me I expect

492
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,450
that we're gonna see something like this

493
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:31,090
happen near the election time okay I

494
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:33,730
really really do the election

495
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,800
influencing like I said it's already

496
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,510
done all so you could you could do this

497
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,580
into the outrage sort of thing in the

498
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,350
event that somebody says something

499
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,449
outrageous and then you want someone to

500
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,370
go sign a petition and to sign this

501
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,290
petition they go online and they log in

502
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,770
and they you know they tell you the name

503
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,450
address social security number numbers

504
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,190
on the back of the credit card right but

505
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,700
when people are outraged the psychology

506
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:59,470
behind that the flood that we get helps

507
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,120
bypass critical thinking and people are

508
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,440
just mad and they put in all kinds of

509
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,239
information on things this is an old

510
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,250
trick by scammers to get people mad and

511
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,510
you can get stuff so what do you do you

512
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,440
put up things like that that are

513
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,090
unbelievable

514
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,429
get them to do a petition these are just

515
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,459
a couple of ways that this sort of video

516
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:18,460
or photo sort of fakes could be played

517
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,410
in there now this is another thing our

518
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,790
brains do and I see the looks in your

519
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,350
eyes okay I know what you're all are

520
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,530
thinking y'all are looking at this

521
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,810
picture going anywhere

522
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,790
nothing any wearing anything this is our

523
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,220
brain doing some conscious biased sorts

524
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:34,250
of things okay by covering those areas

525
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,900
our brains actually turn around and they

526
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,580
fill in the gaps and they make us

527
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,260
believe something if you saw this

528
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,429
picture without that picture you might

529
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,450
think that they're not wearing anything

530
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,240
under that right

531
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:47,060
that's our brain working now what this

532
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,820
means is our brain builds certain

533
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,350
expectations for things and when we

534
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,939
expect to see things you guys have

535
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,919
probably heard about if you're looking

536
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,110
for a yellow car you'll see a yellow car

537
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,780
that kind of stuff right our brain is

538
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,030
building in building in these biases now

539
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,500
if I have you on the fence about

540
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,810
something and you're already leaning

541
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,730
towards that way a little bit and now I

542
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,760
give you some evidence believe it or not

543
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:14,570
our mental states oftentimes will

544
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,700
overlook things that should clearly be

545
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,399
an indicator that it's not true because

546
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,760
of the way that our brains work audio

547
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:26,630
fakes same thing with romance scams you

548
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,930
know what what grandma doesn't want to

549
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:32,090
get a voicemail from say Fabio or Yanni

550
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:34,190
saying they love you right in their

551
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,459
voice right that's where some of these

552
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:39,560
things could be used certainly how about

553
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,870
a fake phone call being intercepted on

554
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,879
the election side right well we don't

555
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,360
have the video but we have this audio of

556
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,800
so-and-so saying this about this right

557
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,090
that's the kind of stuff that's going to

558
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,879
be happening with this stuff now

559
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,560
interestingly enough I just went to that

560
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,710
little show out in San Francisco called

561
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:01,429
RSA if anyone was there was a madhouse

562
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:03,740
as usual right I saw a number of

563
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,800
companies out there that were working in

564
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,290
these fields trying to say that they're

565
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,730
already looking at identifying deep face

566
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,980
we're going to talk about that just a

567
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:16,100
little bit here in a second but how many

568
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:19,880
of you remember this or saw this

569
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,219
fraudsters used AI to mimic CEOs voice

570
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,590
an unusual cybercrime case anyone see

571
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,810
this it's supposed to be business email

572
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,370
compromised where they got a call from

573
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:31,970
the boss now one of the places that I

574
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:36,189
saw in in RSA they were doing this thing

575
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:38,889
where they did fraud for

576
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,570
large-scale call centers right so

577
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:43,269
they're detecting fraud and they were

578
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,428
all about like Oh deep fake this deep

579
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:49,059
fake that and I asked the guy I said all

580
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:52,960
right have you actually seen a case

581
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:55,240
where deep fakes have been used for this

582
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,820
and he pointed to this now the thing is

583
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,700
this was never proven to actually be a

584
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,279
deep fake not a voice actor and I said

585
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,649
well what about that he said well there

586
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:09,100
were some pauses in there that we think

587
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:11,110
may have been now the fact is I have not

588
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,689
seen a single case where it's actually

589
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,820
been fully identified that this happened

590
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,919
however you got people at RSA setting up

591
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,178
a big booth telling you that they're

592
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,700
detecting this he wasn't really happy

593
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,889
with me as I'm pointing out that what

594
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,720
they spent has big holes in it but I

595
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:27,758
mean they had a deep fake video run-in

596
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,139
with Jennifer Lawrence and all kinds of

597
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,279
stuff going on there and I was like look

598
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:35,258
this is not really happened however I

599
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:38,110
promise you it is going to be happening

600
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,610
with as quickly as advancements are

601
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,769
happening even in the free stuff here

602
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,539
and there's some universities doing some

603
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,519
pretty major stuff as well because they

604
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:49,000
have the horsepower to do this this

605
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,070
stuff will be happening for real in the

606
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,039
very near future and we have to watch

607
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,210
for this because this is gonna change

608
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:59,590
the games right

609
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:03,070
we know that Facebook and Twitter have

610
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:05,590
started taking a stance on this so what

611
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,870
we see with them is for the most part

612
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,399
what I've been seeing is they will allow

613
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,489
them to stay up but they're going to

614
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:14,258
mark that right so they will allow face

615
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,269
to stay up now there's a fine line

616
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:18,700
between doing a deep fake and doing

617
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:20,740
creative editing and cutting and

618
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,990
reconstructing of things we've all seen

619
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,039
those videos where it comes back and it

620
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,320
sounds like somebody was saying

621
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,750
something it's taken out of context so

622
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,789
they have a big battle to fight between

623
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,720
those what are we to what do we get rid

624
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:34,149
of so what they're doing is they're

625
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,820
marking them now saying that we believe

626
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:40,120
that this is not real but they are

627
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,389
leaving them up we can detect them

628
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,918
artifacts always remain in the videos

629
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:46,750
you can always see smoothing and the

630
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,340
pixels around the face that still

631
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,650
happens on the audio side there are

632
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,860
that are made by the computer that we

633
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:59,120
cannot physically transition from one

634
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:01,040
sound to another the way the computer

635
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,600
creates the waveform so when you

636
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,340
actually look at the waveform it is

637
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,280
impossible for our mouse to make that

638
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:10,010
sound you can ID some of that stuff here

639
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,570
now the question is at what scale and

640
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,840
how quickly is that going to be

641
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,970
happening okay things like Twitter

642
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,649
things like Facebook YouTube they're

643
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,730
gonna have things in place to look for

644
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,480
digital manipulation

645
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:25,070
but a lot of places may not and so we

646
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,050
have to watch what we're looking at when

647
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,399
it comes to that on the audio side is

648
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,960
your organization going to be able to

649
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,000
deal with the CEO calling and saying

650
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,030
transfer money buy a bunch of gift cards

651
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,640
or whatever very likely not for awhile

652
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,820
and we're probably gonna be behind the

653
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,550
gap on that from a security standpoint

654
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,770
there will be automation with this and

655
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,139
we will be pitting neural networks

656
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,730
against neural networks that are

657
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,710
creating these things to be able to spot

658
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,690
this which is going to be interesting

659
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,700
that's when you know everything goes to

660
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,340
hell and we all decide to live we're

661
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,860
going to live in the matrix right as we

662
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,439
start having AI fighting AI it'll be

663
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,120
very interesting human bias issue again

664
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,010
deep fakes are going to enhance our

665
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,510
prejudices and biases if we already

666
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,490
believe something and then we see

667
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,710
something that confirms our previous

668
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,900
beliefs we are going to be more likely

669
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,810
to believe that whether or not there are

670
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,270
signs you don't need a high text hope to

671
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,220
manipulate people it just doesn't happen

672
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,430
the truth is out there as long as we

673
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,870
care to look for it and I know we're

674
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,340
getting a little bit short on time here

675
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,050
and he's looking at me going oh yeah so

676
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,490
we're gonna skim through this but what

677
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,070
do you do to protect against this

678
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:37,100
honestly and seriously it's like any

679
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,050
other social engineering know if you get

680
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,760
that call if people get that call if

681
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,110
they get an email they get a text or

682
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,370
something they see something that

683
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:49,159
elicits an emotional response we need to

684
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,870
be very careful about that and we need

685
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,150
to try to confirm what's going on that

686
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:56,030
is a key there there is almost always in

687
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:58,220
an emotional response that's being done

688
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,668
through the types of attacks that this

689
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,669
is going on we have to do that we

690
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:06,039
have to pay attention to that I am a big

691
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:08,440
proponent of training people my history

692
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:10,779
comes around the people side like I've

693
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,159
worked in DoD I've worked in all kinds

694
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,210
of ways throughout my career since the

695
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,730
mid 1990s

696
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:18,100
I have seen people over and over again

697
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:21,850
be the source of problems right

698
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,799
we know that happens ok we do need to

699
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,238
train people I'm not saying just because

700
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:28,690
I'm gonna know before you have to use us

701
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:31,600
but teach them what to look for red

702
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,279
flags and emails red flags in text

703
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,988
messages things like that that are quick

704
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,690
for them to identifying oh this is not

705
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:40,509
cool and they report it that's really

706
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,649
what you want to do now of course you

707
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:43,629
want to train them on other stuff too

708
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:47,859
don't use the same password everywhere

709
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:49,389
right ok but here's the deal people say

710
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:53,289
you can't train people I'm telling you

711
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:55,029
you can we prove it all the time but you

712
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:56,440
can train people and that's going to be

713
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:58,480
the defense against this again if

714
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,119
somebody gets something that really

715
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,249
causes an emotional response they need

716
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,350
to be very very careful with it and you

717
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:08,739
need out-of-band ways to confirm things

718
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:11,738
so when you get that email that is the

719
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:13,330
boss or you get the CEO calling in that

720
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:16,359
says I need you to transfer a bunch of

721
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,070
money you need to have a process where

722
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,379
you call them back on an out of bounds

723
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,269
not in the email that they gave you or

724
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:24,609
they told you or the phone number and

725
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:29,109
you call them back on a known good out

726
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:31,178
of bound way to confirm that ok that's a

727
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:33,519
very very key part of this we already

728
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:35,289
have scammers that send emails that come

729
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,399
in and end up saying you know they have

730
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:37,509
a phone number down there if you call

731
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,289
that number they're waiting to answer

732
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:42,820
you yes totally legit right we see that

733
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:45,158
kind of activity already so this is a

734
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,749
way around that the policies and

735
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,609
procedures and training people to be

736
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:52,239
suspicious of this stuff is going to be

737
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:54,428
key when it comes to this so I wish I

738
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:56,379
had more time for questions this is my

739
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:59,919
contact info please reach out to me at

740
00:28:56,379 --> 00:29:01,250
any time sorry this was so fast thank

741
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,619
you that I appreciate it

742
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,619
