the b-sides Nova 20/20 stream will be

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,389
good it's gonna come on across all right

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,639

very much

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,990
yeah and everyone I'm Mark Shapiro on

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:25,710
Twitter as a gentleman guardian mind the

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,930
spelling there at the beginning no

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,189
vowels Thank You Twitter for your use of

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,810
character limit

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,369
project manager at Jake was critical

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,870
mission solutions some artists

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,230
specifically the cyber group and the

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,349
federal and civilian and commercial

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,180
group there and this is my talk on

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:46,350
democratizing intelligence promises and

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,019
pitfalls doubles of this presentation

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,940
overall there's a couple of core

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,489
concepts of intelligence that I want to

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,379
just familiarize everyone's with so that

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,288
we're all speaking the same language and

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,399
understand where I'm going here I want

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,840
to kind of talk about a general

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,320
understanding of how technology is

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,670
lowering the barrier to certain

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,700
intelligence capabilities that kind of

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,470
used to be a nation-state only but maybe

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:17,939
aren't so much anymore I'm gonna kind of

29
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,830
do a not a full demonstration but a talk

30
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,919
about how these capabilities can be

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,970
applied by average people these this and

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,080
some of the concerns and complications

33
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,939
of playing in this space not just as far

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,920
as coming up with bad intelligence

35
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,119
conclusions but also like you know what

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,350
this could mean to you personally

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,729
if things go particularly badly gonna

38
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,589
have to work through the obligatory

39
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,810
disclaimers of course I mentioned that I

40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,490
did work for Jacobs before but this is

41
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,780
not an official Jacob stall right I

42
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,699
don't represent the opinions of my

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,770
employer what I'm talking here it's just

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,549
me spitballing some crazy ideas that

45
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,548
came up with I'm also not necessarily

46
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,110
advocating you start your own mini CIA

47
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:02,070
I'm just kind of informing you that it's

48
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,780
possible and when in doubt if there's

49
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,820
anything that you're you know interested

50
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,038
in trying or any kind of avenues you

51
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,370
want to follow up on talk to a lawyer

52
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,989
which I am NOT and even if I were I'm

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,440
not you're

54
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,180
so you know with with those kind of out

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,800
of the way while we're talking about who

56
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,440
I'm not I'm not a cyber guy right like I

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,300
don't have any CD's or bounties to my

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,359
name I've never gotten rude in a box I I

59
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,360
really don't know what a hoodie either

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,560
so I do want a balaclava this I guess I

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,790
might be that guy on the left I don't

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,210
know I'm also not an Intel guy I've

63
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,730
never formally worked for the DoD or law

64
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,430
enforcement or any of the a lot of big

65
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:52,399
letter agencies I have been told before

66
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:53,810
that I radiate big fed energy I don't

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,770
know that it necessarily believed it but

68
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,870
a random stranger in Whataburger in

69
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,500
Vegas and Def Con 18 used those words

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:08,570
specifically are there any intelligence

71
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,620
officers in the room good like it's kind

72
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,620
of a test right

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,530
I know seriousness though if you are

74
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,180
like an active part of the Intel

75
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,790
community or you were an active part of

76
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,440
the Intel community and you take umbrage

77
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,150
with some of the stuff I'm kind of

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,130
putting out here right like come talk to

79
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,000
me afterwards after we're done right

80
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,670
because I'm not a pro but this is just

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,800
what I see and you know all I am taking

82
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,380
courses and intelligence management

83
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,780
through UMUC at the moment right I'm not

84
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,859
a lifer so set me straight if if you

85
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,420
don't like what I'm coming at you with

86
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,220
if I'm sacrificing some of your say

87
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:48,799
sacred cows

88
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,990
Who I am is a long time computer and

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,520
tech enthusiast right that's me in front

90
00:03:50,990 --> 00:04:00,170
of the Apple 2 in 83 if you looked at my

91
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,210
bio and the in the digital breakdown

92
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,290
that went out the Digital Agenda you'll

93
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:08,120
see that I got a very diverse background

94
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,709
some time and physical security close

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,990
protection executive protection down in

96
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:16,400
Atlanta I've done the software QA I've

97
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,460
done instructional design and corporate

98
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,969
training I've done just a whole bunch of

99
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,219
stuff I kind of have a nice broad T at

100
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,600
the top

101
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,430
with a like a particular area that I

102
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,490
feel I'm specialized in and that I like

103
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,030
to call capability development I'm good

104
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,550
at looking at the LEGO pieces and seeing

105
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,469
how they snap together even if I'm not

106
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,840
necessarily the guy to snap them

107
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,720
together I can I can kind of see how

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:52,000
they do come together and why this

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,490
matters is because this is what I'm

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,140
seeing as somebody who's not a pro right

111
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,970
what is available is something that

112
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,570
anybody with a sufficiently flexible and

113
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,750
creative mind could figure out how to

114
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,400
take care of on their own special

115
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,690
training and especially to cut

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,520
tradecraft while well helpful is no

117
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,000
longer really kind of functionally

118
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:28,960
required in order to start playing in

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:30,220
the Intel space some of us are deviant

120
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,250
back yet

121
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,350
while les had in fast almost that last

122
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,380
year a couple years ago time is mutable

123
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,450
to me he talks about the ten eighty ten

124
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,580
rule right where you've got your top ten

125
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,039
percent and your bottom ten percent and

126
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:50,080
everybody else in between is the eighty

127
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,370
and for our purposes right we've got our

128
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,400
top ten percent right we've got our

129
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,950
letter agencies NSA CIA four and Intel

130
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,250
groups right things like that and we've

131
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,650
got like our bottom ten percent who are

132
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,820
you know folks who are political

133
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,810
operatives who stand up very hasty

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,659
accusatory references to potential

135
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,250
political candidates and then have their

136
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:17,200
operations track back literally to their

137
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:18,640
mother's phone numbers but for all

138
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,580
intents and purposes as long as you're

139
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,070
operating in that middle 80% right for

140
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,229
whatever purpose you're standing up your

141
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,630
little mini Intel shop you're golden

142
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:33,390
right you're good enough to achieve your

143
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:35,919
goals so don't let the notion that

144
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,669
you've got to be you know

145
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,938
operating at the at the level of these

146
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:44,378
you know elite tier Intel agencies kind

147
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:47,650
of keep you from exploring the space a

148
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:50,849
little bit so we're going to talk about

149
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:53,590
intelligence but what is intelligence I

150
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:55,539
borrowed this obviously from the FBI's

151
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,020
website simply defined intelligence is

152
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:01,568
information relevant to decision-making

153
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:08,799
that's very very broad but it's also

154
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:12,129
relevant because what is intelligence in

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,719
one scope is noise in another and this

156
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:18,250
is actually kind of one of the things

157
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:20,110
that was brought up in the September

158
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,680
11th you know post-september 11th

159
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:27,610
reports was a discussion about how there

160
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,589
were several kind of puzzle pieces that

161
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,960
you know this group considered

162
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:34,689
intelligence and and this puzzle piece

163
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,938
over here was considered noise by this

164
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:39,639
silo and and vice versa right there

165
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:41,490
wasn't enough overarching communication

166
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,500
to be able to assemble these things

167
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,819
because each of the agencies was so

168
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,620
silent and that's what got us into the

169
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:49,509
Office of the Director of the national

170
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,069
intelligence and things like that right

171
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,259
you needed somebody to be able to go oh

172
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,939
no no these actually do come together

173
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:57,819
right when you're operating at that top

174
00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:00,279
10% you kind of need that but for our

175
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:02,430
purposes right like if we're talking

176
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,349
about intelligence on a civilian scale

177
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,289
it's just whatever information you need

178
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:11,159
in order to be able to make a

179
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,159
functionally important decision

180
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,500
so this might be familiar to some of

181
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,489
y'all this is the intelligence cycle

182
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,960
will come back and reference this a

183
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,870
couple of times I just want to cut put

184
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,469
it up so folks gonna see it and

185
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:30,710
understand that you know in a in a

186
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,930
general way intelligence operates in

187
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,620
this cycle when you're when you're

188
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,359
looking at a prolonged operation we'll

189
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,520
discuss each of these kind of areas in a

190
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,219
little bit more detail a little bit

191
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,760
later and discuss what the difference is

192
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,500
between say like a pen to pen test or a

193
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,939
red team operation versus something

194
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:56,240
that's a little bit more prolonged like

195
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:57,589
a real Intel saddle so we're gonna first

196
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,459
have a little bit of a history lesson I

197
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:05,660
want to walk through side by side kind

198
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:12,369
of the advancement of technology and

199
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:16,010
computing technology juxtaposed with the

200
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:20,209
advancement of intelligence as a concept

201
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:24,069
as an institution not just at the nation

202
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:26,540
state level but kind of in the West

203
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,990
we're gonna start off in the early 20th

204
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,670
century here we're starting to see the

205
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:36,110
beginning of like kind of real Sigyn

206
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:37,670
right during World War one with

207
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:42,350
Marconi's Telegraph over there on the

208
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:45,620
left groups that are doing intelligence

209
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,980
work figure out kind of how to intercept

210
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,330
and and decrypt telegraph messages that

211
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,459
are being sent back and forth between

212
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:57,380
assets in in the seas this interception

213
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,819
while technical in nature the decryption

214
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,230
is still kind of essentially done by

215
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,480
hand right that says there's a guy

216
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,670
listening in and he's got a like jot

217
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,440
down what's being said and then he's got

218
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,910
to like hand it to a dude who's kind of

219
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,410
responsible for figuring out the

220
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,510
patterns and making it happen right

221
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,459
there's no computer helping them out but

222
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,810
from a technical capabilities

223
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:18,290
perspective this is where you kind of

224
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:22,599
start to see the first use of technical

225
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,599
collection in in this respect

226
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:31,189
you've got on the computer tech side

227
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:34,129
over here on the right you've got the

228
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:37,118
first kind of single-use purpose-built

229
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:40,459
electromechanical devices or put out IBM

230
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:43,129
builds a punch card based tabulating

231
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:44,978
machine to help with the 1890 census and

232
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:48,709
it's essentially just a really big

233
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:50,660
calculator right requires a room full of

234
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:55,039
ladies sorting punch cards to get

235
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,919
results out of there's no kind of direct

236
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:01,220
applicability to intelligence analysis

237
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,279
at either an operational or a strategic

238
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,829
level at this point it's just it's just

239
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:11,229
it's a great big calculator that takes

240
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:15,019
up a roomful of heavy duty resources

241
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:18,709
moving into World War two and that kind

242
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:20,139
of time period right SIGINT starts

243
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,829
playing a more vital role here

244
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:25,609
everybody's kind of familiar with

245
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:27,319
Bletchley Park and the Enigma and ultra

246
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:29,869
efforts right the the efforts to crack

247
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:32,799
the Enigma code slightly less well-known

248
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:35,809
but also just as important the magic

249
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:40,129
efforts which were the USS efforts to

250
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:44,149
try to break Japanese code breaking you

251
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:46,459
kind of start getting a more based on

252
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:50,329
their efforts to do that you start

253
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:53,329
getting a more institutionalized view of

254
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:56,628
strategic intelligence you have a formal

255
00:11:53,329 --> 00:12:00,469
formation of the OSS which is designed

256
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:02,109
to kind of coordinate across all of the

257
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,879
various branches of the military

258
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:06,589
whatever they pick up and kind of act as

259
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,709
the governing body for all intelligence

260
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:12,079
through that about this time and

261
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,998
technology in 1943

262
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,258
you've got the mark one Colossus which

263
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:18,109
is actually pictured over there on the

264
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:20,119
left again you can see women in

265
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:22,249
computing right tending to it

266
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,639
and-and-and and helping to keep it

267
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:27,109
operating these were computers that were

268
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,819
1,500 vacuum tube computers there were a

269
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:30,739
series of ten of them and they were

270
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,299
designed to facilitate Enigma code

271
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:34,330
breaking that's literally all they did

272
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:36,699
they were a single purpose again single

273
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:43,660
this machine more strategically applied

274
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:49,300
this time but you know specifically done

275
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:53,260
with the intent to to help crack the

276
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,569
Enigma codes in 1944 you also have the

277
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,530
Harvard mark 1 which is technically the

278
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:02,680
second program controlled machine konrad

279
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,750
zuse out in germany was the first one to

280
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,040
come up with an operational programmable

281
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,180
computer and was the z3 that was in 1941

282
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,230
but we weren't gonna let him get away

283
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,920
with that so we destroyed it

284
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,920
we bought it so you know the US has the

285
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,650
first that that survived the war the

286
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,360
mark 1 was 55 excuse me 51 feet long

287
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:28,120
it weighed 5 tons had 750 thousand parts

288
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,460
72 accumulators and and it was

289
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,160
essentially built to calculate a 23

290
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:37,150
digit number with a plus or a minus sign

291
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,819
and the Navy used it to to help set up

292
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,730
its ballistics tables to ensure more

293
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,170
accurate fire from its cannons and this

294
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,540
is one of the first occasions where you

295
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:50,579
see computing technology being used for

296
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,870
at least technical operational purposes

297
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:57,010
there's still somewhat relatively single

298
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:59,490
purpose machines that will work too

299
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:03,040
through the first half of the Cold War

300
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,960
this is the Cold War and a nuclear

301
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,670
related espionage is really the prime

302
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,190
kind of environment for intelligence

303
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,790
driven developments in computing

304
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:15,550
technology the resource cost for

305
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,500
computing technology still very high in

306
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,099
many terms both in terms of space energy

307
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,920
heat and human resources you have

308
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,480
whirlwind in 1951 it was the first

309
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,979
interactive computer with a with a

310
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,240
keyboard and a cathode ray tube that

311
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,080
technology which was designed to do

312
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,090
weather monitoring would later become

313
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,370
sage which is what's pictured here the

314
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,200
semi-automatic ground environment a

315
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,230
system of real-time computers designed

316
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,390
to warn against air attacks it served as

317
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,550
the backbone for NORAD's early

318
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:53,680
interception until the 80s

319
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:58,149
I was based on IBM's ANF sq7 platform

320
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,180
60,000 vacuum tubes 250 tons used three

321
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:04,410
megawatts of electricity and performed

322
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:06,550
75,000 instructions a second as

323
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:10,240
technology continues to progress we get

324
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,260
the first supercomputer the cray over

325
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,690
there on the left that Cray one

326
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:18,269
installed at Oak Ridge National

327
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:22,269
Laboratories you also start to see in

328
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:24,790
businesses the adoption of what are

329
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,560
called decision support systems and

330
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,810
they're very large businesses are very

331
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,890
large operations that are responsible

332
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:34,180
for industrial kinds of control programs

333
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,019
and things like that that would normally

334
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:42,790
require a very heavy personal overhead

335
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:47,290
to make decisions will begin using

336
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:49,000
computers to try to remove the human

337
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,880
element from that and try to make

338
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,740
decisions based on the data that the

339
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:59,410
computers are giving them this is

340
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:02,220
essentially the beginning of what would

341
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:05,920
later be called business intelligence

342
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:09,550
but it's also at this time we have the

343
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,120
the evolution of true institutionalized

344
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:16,839
intelligence right with the OSS turning

345
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,760
into the CIA under Allen Dulles the FBI

346
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,160
conducting domestic intelligence

347
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,870
gathering under Hoover a lot of that

348
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,189
effort obviously directed towards Russia

349
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:33,130
and it's and its various proxies towards

350
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:35,470
the end of this time period computing

351
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:38,020
technology got into a kind of negative

352
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,800
light and some of the Intel community

353
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:43,649
based on the fact that it was kind of

354
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,800
miss applied in decision-making

355
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:50,500
processes regarding the Vietnam War and

356
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,849
so they're sort of institutionally

357
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,350
within the United States intelligence

358
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:59,399
community became a a general distrust of

359
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,390
computer and technology based

360
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,760
intelligence related work

361
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,470
it was it was kind of generally decided

362
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,910
that humans were better at this and to

363
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,890
put computers on the back shelf for a

364
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,410
while we'll see why this is irrelevant

365
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:15,130
next as we come into the late 20th

366
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:17,530
century and computer technology begins

367
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,030
to help get more miniaturized you start

368
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,560
to see computer personal computers at

369
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,020
home but it's still not terribly

370
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,339
advanced right big institutional

371
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,079
spenders are getting more bang for their

372
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,159
buck with server class computing you're

373
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,909
starting to see the beginning of the

374
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,920
world wide web from an espionage

375
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:36,900
perspective we're coming up towards the

376
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:39,700
end of the Cold War as the cold war ends

377
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:46,600
we're starting to see the development of

378
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:49,180
other intelligence that's right other

379
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,280
intelligence related capabilities and

380
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,720
kind of an overall broadening of

381
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,430
theaters of operation right now that we

382
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,320
no longer have to focus on Russia we can

383
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,430
kind of start shopping around a little

384
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,899
bit like where are we going next guys

385
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,050
what are we what are we working on next

386
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,520
and the intelligence community though is

387
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,550
still kind of gun-shy about using

388
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,490
computing tech to do Intel work in lieu

389
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,050
of well-trained humans the concept of

390
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,550
business intelligence that continues to

391
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:18,010
gain traction and it's formally coined

392
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:22,720
in 1989 a lot of the work that companies

393
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:27,010
are doing at this point has caught up in

394
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,580
terms of scope with where the

395
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:33,370
nation-state apparatuses are at where

396
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:36,360
you kind of have a strategic self

397
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:38,830
looking we're going to use technological

398
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:42,370
aggregated intelligence to help us make

399
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:46,350
better decisions internally but not

400
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:48,850
necessarily as much externally yet I

401
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,429
tried to find a graphic for business

402
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:55,209
intelligence but they were so bad or

403
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:58,000
just so that the early 21st century

404
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,910
right we we see continued exponential

405
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,850
growth in computing technology cloud

406
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,740
tech birth and the rise of big tech

407
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,320
companies and a technically Apple

408
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,600
started back at the end of the 20th

409
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,689
century or kind of in the middle period

410
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,889
technically but a lot of these almost

411
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,320
all these companies

412
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:21,159
over there on the left made big pivots

413
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,720
in the early 21st century that have

414
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,289
solidified their place where they are

415
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,419
now more and more businesses and smaller

416
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,340
institutions as technology is being

417
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:32,409
increasingly available to them are

418
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,379
finding ways to leverage business

419
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:38,980
intelligence to make not only internal

420
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:42,340
decisions but also starting to look at

421
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,529
ways where intelligence can help them

422
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,809
make adversarial decisions against

423
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:49,630
possible opponents getting ahead of

424
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:52,360
their opponents or doing things to

425
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,980
thwart them or things like that you have

426
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,139
the rise of private intelligence firms

427
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,330
often sponsored by Inc you tell right

428
00:19:56,139 --> 00:20:01,479
Palantir comes to mind as well as a

429
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,010
couple of others government looks to

430
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,750
them to past save costs with

431
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:09,399
public-private partnerships and and

432
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:11,620
things like that on a personal level at

433
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:14,168
about this time we start seeing the

434
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:17,289
advancement of the quantified self kind

435
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:19,450
of concept where human beings are sort

436
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:21,129
of started to keep tabs on data on

437
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,190
themselves and what's my blood pressure

438
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:26,169
and you know how am i how am i doing how

439
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,360
much sleep am I getting these kinds of

440
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:33,700
things we're starting to see on an

441
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:35,529
individual level a a repeat of the

442
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,960
cycles we've seen developed so far where

443
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:39,779
we have a single purpose I have my

444
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,429
Fitbit and it helps me count my steps

445
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:45,700
right that's a special a specific

446
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:48,370
computer that I'm using for that in the

447
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,720
same way that intelligence formal

448
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:55,299
intelligence communities have been using

449
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:57,100
it in the past you know nowadays almost

450
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:59,620
everybody has some kind of SmartWatch on

451
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,899
unless you're the type to stay away from

452
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:07,870
them which in the audience here is not

453
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:09,939
entirely unlikely but when I talk about

454
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,100
how companies are starting to use

455
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,190
intelligence adversarially against each

456
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,639
other here's an example of kind of what

457
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:21,580
I'm gesturing at in me in the first 20

458
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:24,340
years of the 21st century this headline

459
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,039
is from the PBM Broadcasting Company and

460
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:31,519
aap it's dated October 12 October 2nd

461
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:34,729
2014 US security firm identified a

462
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,889
mobile Trojan that was linked to several

463
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:39,919
apps that were purported to be developed

464
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:43,459
by protesters Hong Kong protesters to

465
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,830
aid in organizing protests right so

466
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,159
that's a legit headline from before and

467
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:52,039
and if this if this may were to be

468
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,859
determined to be true one would expect

469
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,929
to see or a headline something like this

470
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:58,999
right report secret program china

471
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:02,239
program spied on Hong Kong protesters

472
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:05,629
right that would not be an unexpected

473
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:07,580
headline to see that's actually a word

474
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:09,889
swap for a different headline that came

475
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,619
out about the same time which is report

476
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:17,408
secret uber program hell spied on lyft

477
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:20,720
drivers right so we're starting to see

478
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:23,509
private entities engaging in

479
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,779
intelligence operations against one

480
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:29,090
another to a certain extent here's

481
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:32,049
another example France accuses Russia of

482
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,009
spying on you military from space right

483
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,629
Russian satellites getting a little too

484
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:39,859
close to French satellites France is

485
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:43,099
worried that Russia is intercepting

486
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:47,418
communications from them bit date on

487
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:49,428
that September 7 2018 again a reword

488
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:52,039
Russia used satellites intercept

489
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,139
communications of French military if

490
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,259
that above plane were proven true that

491
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:59,959
would be a reasonable headline one might

492
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:02,470
expect to see when the truth of that was

493
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,470
reported

494
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,299
this is the headline i we're topped with

495
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:12,840
boston redsox used apple watches to

496
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:15,539
steal signs against yankees okay in this

497
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:19,168
particular case they used a infield

498
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:20,340
camera and they monitored hand signals

499
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:22,919
that the catcher was using and they

500
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,799
would relay from the video replay room

501
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,279
down to the dugout via Apple watch and

502
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:31,889
then person in the dugout would make

503
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,389
gestures or do something to try to get

504
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:35,639
the attention of the batter so that they

505
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:38,969
would have just a fraction of a second

506
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:40,889
to know what pitch was coming down the

507
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:46,730
pipe more than they would before just

508
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:49,258
enough to give them that advantage so

509
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,620
it's where do we go from here right

510
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:56,879
what's what's the road ahead my my

511
00:23:51,620 --> 00:24:00,629
position my stance on that my my

512
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:04,500
assertion is that this application of

513
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:06,600
kind of adversarial intelligence by

514
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,139
corporations by private entities and

515
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,370
things like that against individuals and

516
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:13,949
other entities in our current

517
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,018
information environment combined with

518
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,590
the advancement of technology that we've

519
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:22,230
kind of chronicled thus far presents an

520
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:26,418
operation assuming an opportunity for

521
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:30,409
individuals to start doing their own

522
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:33,720
little micro intelligence operations and

523
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:35,909
that we may need to start doing these in

524
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,409
the future right we may need for our own

525
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:39,809
well-being or the well-being of the

526
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:45,419
people we care about to kind of sit down

527
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:47,879
and and you know figure out how to how

528
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,529
to navigate an environment where we're

529
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:51,029
kind of being actively worked against

530
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:57,090
from an intelligence capabilities

531
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:58,620
perspective so you know assuming one

532
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,059
wants to take up this task zooming one

533
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,000
wants to kind of get involved in it not

534
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:07,289
that I'm necessarily advocating one does

535
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,110
but if you do right we're gonna revisit

536
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,600
the intelligence cycle we're gonna start

537
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,830
at the 12 o'clock position of planning

538
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,510
and direction and kind of move around

539
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,320
the outside technically we're gonna

540
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:20,009
start the middle with

541
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,379
mission because the first thing you've

542
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:24,600
got to do is figure out what your

543
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,350
mission is and and what you care about

544
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,320
right you can't just start grabbing data

545
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,610
and and boat collecting and going well

546
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,928
I'll figure out what's important down

547
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,769
the line right the first thing you got

548
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:40,019
to do is figure out what the intent of

549
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:42,840
your shop is because remember our

550
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,389
definition from earlier intelligence is

551
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,750
information relevant to decision-making

552
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:50,070
so what's what's your decision why are

553
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,950
you doing what you're doing what are you

554
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:56,928
looking for what problem are you solving

555
00:25:51,950 --> 00:26:01,350
it doesn't have to be like a big deal

556
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:03,029
you know a huge social justice thing I

557
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:07,168
actually stood up like a like a little

558
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:09,840
mini Intel shop after the sulemani

559
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,250
strike just because I noticed all my

560
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,949
friends on Facebook were freaking out

561
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:17,460
about World War 3 and I was like guys

562
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:19,080
just chill right like let me you guys

563
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,320
trust me you guys know I'm a reasonable

564
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,480
researcher let me just help you get to

565
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,070
sleep tonight right sleep through the

566
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,950
weekend and we'll see where we stand on

567
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,899
Monday so I you know I stood up a little

568
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,340
thing I queried the sources I had I put

569
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,928
together an analytical product and I

570
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,490
delivered it to them in a four paragraph

571
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,740
post on Facebook and then I shut down my

572
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,169
shop went to sleep for the night right

573
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,700
like but that's kind of what I'm talking

574
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:42,779
about when I'm gesturing at this right

575
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,759
you need to pick your mission

576
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:49,649
what's because that's gonna define

577
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:51,809
everything else that comes after it keep

578
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:54,870
in mind that what's small for somebody

579
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:57,480
else might be big for you or another

580
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:00,149
person right if if you're a targeted

581
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,330
population if you're a minority in a

582
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:05,039
vulnerable area and there's an uptick in

583
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,580
distribution of hate literature there

584
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:11,490
and you decide that you want to stand up

585
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,379
a shop Intel shop to kind of track down

586
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,460
where the neo-nazis are in your

587
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:18,928
neighborhood right like that's maybe

588
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,330
it's a small deal to someone like the

589
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,669
NSA but it's kind of a big deal to you

590
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,019
right like your personal health and

591
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:27,620
safety and well-being are kind of

592
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,620
wrapped up in this

593
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:37,889
so don't necessarily feel like you got

594
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:39,600
to have some some grand social social

595
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,070
justice thing that you're aligned to you

596
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,600
certainly can right if you want to get

597
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,730
involved in anti-corruption or anti

598
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,320
child trafficking or any of the other

599
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,360
kind of broader social issues out there

600
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,500
like absolutely feel free you can stand

601
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,199
up your own shop to support those

602
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,850
efforts but sometimes the most important

603
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,740
missions of personal one's right like

604
00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:01,259
ensuring your own safety so planning and

605
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,399
direction right like that's the next and

606
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:05,100
start from the 12 o'clock and you're

607
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,620
moving around the cycle once you've

608
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,240
defined your mission you need to start

609
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,820
figuring out your collection plans and

610
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,289
the direction you want to go in we

611
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,080
return to the question of what's good

612
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:19,519
enough right remember that little 80%

613
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,418
rule you don't need to be in the top 10%

614
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,379
but you certainly don't want to be in

615
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,639
the bottom you're gonna want to define

616
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:32,939
what level of effort you're willing to

617
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:35,209
exert you're going to want to start kind

618
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,460
of getting into the weeds on your topic

619
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:41,820
doing a little bit more general research

620
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:45,659
start with not necessarily not

621
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,779
necessarily looking for answers yet but

622
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:51,179
looking for the right questions to ask

623
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:53,370
right if you've defined your mission and

624
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,740
you're you're trying to set up planning

625
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,289
and direction

626
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:02,759
start thinking about what questions

627
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:04,379
drive what's behind your mission this is

628
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:05,519
the same kind of process for those of

629
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:06,959
you who have done a lot of like pen

630
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,360
testing work right whenever you're

631
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,110
scoping out a new pen test engagement

632
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,418
right this is not new right this is

633
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,370
something you do right up front right

634
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:20,009
and oftentimes you write it down so that

635
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,539
you and the customer have a clear

636
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:25,919
understanding of what the scope of your

637
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:27,269
pen testing agreement is when I used to

638
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,879
do instructional design we called this

639
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:32,519
front end analysis right just kind of

640
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:39,000
getting grips on on what exactly we need

641
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:40,590
to cover moving on to collection right

642
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,610
you start with those in because why not

643
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:48,419
it's the most prevalent and has the

644
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:50,669
general lowest barrier to entry there

645
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,120
are plenty of resources to teach you

646
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,650
about

647
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,870
Osen right now I'm not going to cover

648
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:58,860
them here because you can like literally

649
00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:01,409
stumble across them on Twitter you know

650
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,479
there's people search engines and and

651
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:06,270
Google Dorking and all sorts of other

652
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,130
you know opportunities and resources

653
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,170
that are available for you you know if

654
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,970
you want to spend money and you know

655
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:15,270
spend a couple thousand dollars and get

656
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,560
it from the folks at at the link at

657
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,570
right let go to one of their three-day

658
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:23,580
intensive workshops and really like

659
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:24,450
learn to be an ocean you know pro okay

660
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,669
great

661
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,360
otherwise right like there's YouTube

662
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:32,460
videos right there's Twitter feeds you

663
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,560
can you can get this stuff just about

664
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,090
anywhere right you decide again your

665
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,550
level of involvement how much it matters

666
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:42,080
to you how much you want to get involved

667
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,080
in the in the learning process for this

668
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,230
don't underestimate the power of things

669
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:52,550
like gray literature or FOIA requests

670
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:55,560
court or other public records land deeds

671
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:57,240
various bits of obscure technical

672
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,520
documentation right things like that

673
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,370
they may not necessarily provide you

674
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,040
with direct information but they can

675
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:07,979
often provide very important context and

676
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:12,629
depending on what your your sensible

677
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:14,430
mission is you know that can make the

678
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,470
difference between something that kind

679
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:19,770
of exists in the lower end of well this

680
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,390
is useful and wow this was really this

681
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:24,060
was really good

682
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,370
it'll also you know there are occasions

683
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,810
where people start doing research and

684
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,580
then they make a FOIA request on

685
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,210
something that they're trying to figure

686
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,040
out about and they uncover a whole

687
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,540
separate thing that they had no idea

688
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,340
about right a whole Avenue that was

689
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,310
previously hidden opens up because of

690
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,610
proper redaction or you know just

691
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:45,800
because they weren't aware of it and

692
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:50,459
official sources were relying on

693
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,928
security through obscurity right so you

694
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,149
know strategic Google's working

695
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:55,980
things like that my only caution with

696
00:31:54,149 --> 00:32:01,199
like gray literature and FOIA type stuff

697
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,610
is that a lot of times number one some

698
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,470
of its free but sometimes there's an

699
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:09,258
Associated cost right so you got up you

700
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:12,330
gotta pay and number two in some cases

701
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:16,350
the fact that you made these requests is

702
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:19,499
logged and in in other cases it is

703
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:21,570
forcibly disclosed to the entities about

704
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:24,899
which you are making requests you know

705
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:29,610
yes technically you can go down and and

706
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:33,869
request land plat diagrams for your

707
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:35,729
neighbors at the courthouse right but I

708
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:38,850
think once a month at least in Virginia

709
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,429
I believe once a month there's kind of

710
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,049
an audit of like hey here's all the

711
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:46,559
people who requested information on your

712
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:48,029
house and if somebody's land shows up

713
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,860
there they get a notification hey

714
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:53,940
somebody somebody's looking into your

715
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:56,248
house right maybe you care maybe you

716
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,509
don't but you know if you want to stand

717
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:59,850
on the radar

718
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:02,009
consider that sometimes gray literature

719
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:06,869
and FOIA requests have mandatory

720
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:10,879
disposers associated with them hardware

721
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:10,879
hacking and technical ends right

722
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:21,110
this is not necessarily limited to soft

723
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:23,750
into related research if you're

724
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:26,810
concerned about water quality ground

725
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:30,800
water quality in your town or you're

726
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:32,780
concerned about you know various you

727
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,550
know air air quality or pollution or

728
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:39,020
even if you just want to like capture

729
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:41,600
image intelligence of somebody you can

730
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,150
you can build that right you can get a

731
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,639
single-board computer from any one of a

732
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,650
number of suppliers and throw a couple

733
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,630
hats on their diagnostic ATS you see up

734
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,940
there I got a Geiger counter kit right

735
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,440
maybe maybe radiation monitoring matters

736
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,880
to you right or the mission that you're

737
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,620
up against

738
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,930
you know nation states don't have the

739
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,419
monopoly on that capability anymore are

740
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,760
you gonna be as good as a nation state

741
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,640
who can like determine these kinds of

742
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,440
thing from space no absolutely not but

743
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,750
like will you be good enough to attain

744
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,159
your objective yeah probably I mean

745
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,170
unless your objective is unreasonable

746
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,699
like you're looking for you know Doc

747
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:20,750
Brown and his you know radioactive

748
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:25,009
isotopes that he stole from the Libyans

749
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:26,120
the power is time-machine right but the

750
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,250
the point is that from a technical

751
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,690
perspective if you're willing to write

752
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,949
you can just build technical collectors

753
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,350
you can work them into wearables or

754
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:38,179
portables you can go to a library and

755
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,739
use a 3d printer to make a decorative

756
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,389
housing for it and then spray paint that

757
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:44,239
decorative housing so it looks like a

758
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:45,889
common piece of furniture or a

759
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,870
collectible item or something like that

760
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,509
then you get on somebody's bookshelf

761
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,560
right like you know I think I'm where

762
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,570
you want to go with that we'll kind of

763
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,520
get into into some of the possible

764
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,350
pitfalls of approaches like that but the

765
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,170
point is the capability exists right you

766
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:01,940
can do it and you know I'm not gonna get

767
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,250
into technical details of how to do it

768
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,950
because there are again hundreds of

769
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,020
talks and and other presentations on

770
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,490
that kind of thing but like don't let it

771
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,470
intimidate you right you see the

772
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,850
Pringles yagi antenna down there all

773
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:18,140
right if it's stupid but it works it's

774
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:19,400
not stupid you also don't have to like

775
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,440
build it on your own right if you're

776
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,970
lazy or you're too busy or you're just

777
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,800
on confident your skills you can buy

778
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,660
pre-built right like you can go to

779
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,660
Amazon

780
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,288
what they've got or eBay or Bangalore

781
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,460
Alibaba

782
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:33,970
if you don't care about getting from the

783
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:36,760
Chinese right so I actually have here I

784
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,288
put a band-aid over it so that nobody

785
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,430
can actually see out of the the front of

786
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:45,309
the camera but like this is a 720p

787
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:48,038
45-minute IR enabled camera you know fit

788
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,599
in the like little auxiliary pocket on

789
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:51,369
my jeans

790
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,720
you know it can be spray-painted some

791
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:56,410
color it could be hidden or mounted

792
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,230
anywhere I got up to 40 bucks I got it

793
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,759
at the end cap of my grocery store right

794
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,220
like it didn't even have to go to a spy

795
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,829
shop to get it I was literally out

796
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,480
shopping for food because I wanted to

797
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:09,730
make sure I had a two-week supply of

798
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,760
food for the coronavirus and we like

799
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,770
walk past the end cap and I was like the

800
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:20,710
cop cam what's that that'll go great

801
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:22,538
with my talk right and so if you don't

802
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,150
care about proprietary nassif you don't

803
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:27,010
care about it necessarily being unique

804
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,210
to you or being particularly well hidden

805
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,430
because you know the people who you're

806
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,079
trying to spy on are not that observant

807
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:38,169
right

808
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:39,549
okay sure why not take the easy road so

809
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,770
we're starting to move out a collection

810
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:43,119
and into processing a little bit alright

811
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:47,440
we're kind of in an area that spanned

812
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:50,140
the to group where is a big thing and

813
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,039
and fora and form various forums and

814
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:57,250
things like that you know discord slack

815
00:36:54,039 --> 00:37:01,150
key base loop signal chats right there

816
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:02,650
are are probably dozens of private ones

817
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,000
between people who are really pros at

818
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,299
this and enjoy doing it in their spare

819
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,130
time

820
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:10,170
I'm not a member of any of them super

821
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:13,390
cool groups but I have like a couple of

822
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:17,319
opens you know publicly facing dis cords

823
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:19,480
where folks who can kind of congregate

824
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,819
mmm they got bots that scrape Twitter

825
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,279
for me and you know they've got a couple

826
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:25,569
of you know foreign language experts and

827
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:27,460
a couple of other imagery intelligence

828
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:29,589
experts who are kind of on tap and you

829
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,020
can ping them in the discord if hey you

830
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:34,180
know Hizballah just sent out this

831
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,130
particular message I don't it's in

832
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,520
Arabic I can't read it right like a

833
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,359
so-and-so get in here

834
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,970
hope you understand what this thing says

835
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:47,690
you know that's that's available to you

836
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:49,848
as as a private civilian you know

837
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,230
obviously you need to take what you get

838
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:54,530
from it with a little bit of a grain of

839
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:56,750
salt right depending on the moderation

840
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:00,260
level and how well you trust the people

841
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:03,020
in these kinds of groups you know there

842
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:06,920
can be a very high noise level and a

843
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:09,230
very high misinformation level but again

844
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,630
right like what's good enough you know

845
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,440
you're not you're not coordinating a

846
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,359
drone strike

847
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,330
right so it doesn't matter whether or

848
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:19,040
not your translation is 100% accurate or

849
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,830
you don't necessarily fully kind of

850
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,300
understand the nuances of what's going

851
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:27,589
on here right I'm just trying to help my

852
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:29,750
friends get to sleep tonight right so

853
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:31,670
you know when has ballin made a

854
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:35,030
statement about you know how they were

855
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:39,170
gonna react in the wake of of sulemani

856
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:41,599
x' killing right like the local red guy

857
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,790
got in there and and you know hey this

858
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,470
is my stance on this is based on what I

859
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,720
know if Hezbollah and how they phrase

860
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,480
their threats right this is kind of my

861
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,770
interpretation and I really didn't have

862
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,770
much choice that kind of took him at his

863
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,330
word but there was a guy who could do

864
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,560
that for me right I didn't have to

865
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,180
handle that on my own

866
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,509
because I was a member of a group like

867
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:07,220
this so consider it again whether or not

868
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:09,530
you're your mission warrants that if

869
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:12,890
you're going to use these for collection

870
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:16,580
purposes try to get two or three sources

871
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:18,830
and kind of cross that them you know

872
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:21,460
don't necessarily up well it came across

873
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:24,380
the disk or it absolutely has to be true

874
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,430
you know if you guys know of any others

875
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,349
are have any others and you want to

876
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:29,348
share them later just go flag me down

877
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,619
as far as additional processing goes

878
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:37,279
right if you're going to get in

879
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:38,809
technical int stuff you're possibly

880
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,530
gonna find yourself drowning and data

881
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:50,150
would be fast we talked earlier about

882
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:51,859
how the you know in the past there were

883
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,510
giant warehouses full of computers that

884
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:56,569
were dedicated to single tasks

885
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:58,609
you know intercepting possible airborne

886
00:39:56,569 --> 00:40:00,079
traffic now we have giant warehouses

887
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:02,210
full of computers that you can rent the

888
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,400
slice of right like you can get in there

889
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,799
and you can have a fraction of that

890
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,970
processing power and you can use it to

891
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:11,020
kind of help make sense of your Twitter

892
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:14,410
graph right you can you know use it to

893
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:16,849
decipher the connections between a

894
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:19,180
possible disinformation network that

895
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:21,920
you're kind of looking to tease apart

896
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,480
you know you don't have to be

897
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,349
responsible for standing that up on your

898
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:33,410
own if you're willing to make the

899
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:35,240
investment analysis in production as far

900
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,649
as technical innovation goes there's

901
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,598
really not a lot to get into here right

902
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:41,089
like you're always gonna have to write

903
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:47,000
it up you always got to make it visible

904
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:48,859
to the outside world there are again

905
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,940
plenty of other individual courses out

906
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:52,098
there about good ways to present

907
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,720
information the Facebook is constantly

908
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:56,030
hitting me up to try to get into one of

909
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,319
tough these classes on data

910
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,359
visualization and things like that

911
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,950
because I'm a bit of a data scientist

912
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,140
geek

913
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,640
I actually recommend the analytic

914
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,250
writing guide by Luis Kaiser and

915
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,609
Randolph each person who I have here I

916
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:13,549
got that downloaded to my Kindle anybody

917
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:17,630
who's doing a red team or other kind of

918
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:18,530
Intel etype work as a profession or even

919
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:21,530
though the occasion pointier

920
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:23,530
vocationally knows that while the fun

921
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,609
part is the testing and the collection

922
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,780
the most important parts of the write-up

923
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:29,540
right

924
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,490
if you can't convey your findings at the

925
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,319
end of the day it doesn't matter how

926
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:35,839
much fun you had pulling down those

927
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:37,160
results we're going to touch on this a

928
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:42,049
little bit more during the pitfalls

929
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:44,029
section and then lastly dissemination

930
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:45,650
area integration and this is where

931
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:48,140
we kind of draw the line between the

932
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,120
one-off pen tests and persistent

933
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,000
intelligence capabilities right folks

934
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:56,299
who have have been doing or are doing

935
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,610
pen tests right you you you set your

936
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,160
scope you do your work you process your

937
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,990
findings you wrote up your report you

938
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,910
delivered it to your customer and then

939
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,439
the engagement stops right like you're

940
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,420
done unless you're part of an internal

941
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,110
red team who will constantly kind of be

942
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:14,090
testing the system for an Intel shop

943
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,230
unless you're doing like a one-off I'm

944
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,720
gonna help my friends get to sleep

945
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:20,360
tonight kind of setup right if you're if

946
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,819
you're keeping tabs on hate groups or

947
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:26,240
sex offenders in your neighborhood right

948
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:27,830
like you are gonna be required to take

949
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,410
the information you learn from the last

950
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,420
cycle you went through and kind of fold

951
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,890
it back up and go okay well how does

952
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,830
this change my direction now that I know

953
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:39,440
these things what can I do where can I

954
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:45,620
go from here you know how does this

955
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:47,270
change the direction I move so we don't

956
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,920
you know you don't want kind of operate

957
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:51,140
from the perspective of identified all

958
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,610
the members of our of a hate group in

959
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,020
our local area that's it we're done

960
00:42:52,610 --> 00:43:03,980
we've identified them we're squared away

961
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:07,700
so pitfalls lack of formal analysis

962
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:10,270
training but I when you're doing this

963
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,980
kind of thing there are a whole slew of

964
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:16,480
data interpretation and cognitive biases

965
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:19,070
that can get in the way of being able to

966
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,410
make an accurate report even if it's

967
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:25,340
just to your friends if you don't want

968
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:29,180
to end up in that bottom 10% you need to

969
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:34,070
kind of be familiar with the techniques

970
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:35,950
that folks used to you know kind of

971
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:41,180
minimize the chances of those biases

972
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:43,160
being an issue three resources I

973
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,569
recommend here tradecraft primer

974
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,430
structured analytic techniques for

975
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,290
improving intelligence analysis that's

976
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:50,390
available for free on the CIA's website

977
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:53,740
right like you can literally just go to

978
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:56,330
the CIA's website and download that and

979
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,450
maybe they track you I don't know but

980
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:59,130
like you know

981
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:02,669
putting it out there this is what their

982
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:05,579
guys use to try to minimize cognitive

983
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:08,430
bias psychology of intelligence analysis

984
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:10,500
Richards Jake Huard jr. another resource

985
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:13,980
used a lot in my intelligence management

986
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:16,770
classes it is also available for free on

987
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:20,190
the CIA's website you can just download

988
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,560
it and start reading don't mistake me

989
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:24,000
right these are not great fun bedtime

990
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,259
reads I mean maybe they're great for

991
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,690
bedtime does it put you to sleep

992
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,570
but you know they're not terribly

993
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:33,780
thrilling if you want something that's a

994
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:36,510
little bit more fun to read cases in

995
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,790
intelligence analysis by Sarah Miller

996
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:41,630
bead BB B but I don't know how to

997
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:44,070
pronounce her name in Randolph H person

998
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,829
that particular book is available on

999
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:48,900
Amazon I went ahead and downloaded that

1000
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:52,290
that's a fun book to read when you're

1001
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:57,869
sitting next to a super beefy Russian

1002
00:44:52,290 --> 00:45:02,069
dude who has a bald head and and visible

1003
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:04,800
tattoos on a four-hour plane flight to a

1004
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:06,450
security conference when all he's doing

1005
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,329
is kind of giving you the side eye and

1006
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:12,210
browsing his Vee contact profiles that's

1007
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:14,730
a that's a fun one to be looking through

1008
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:17,579
but that book in particular goes through

1009
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,470
several previous intelligence cases and

1010
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:22,440
then applies structured analytical

1011
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,149
techniques to them some of them didn't

1012
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,950
have analytical techniques applied to

1013
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,540
them before and were kind of cluster

1014
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:31,500
foxes right so pardon pardon my french

1015
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:33,210
kind of a disaster area and so some of

1016
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,819
them are retrospectives and going right

1017
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:39,839
if they had looked at these things it

1018
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:41,759
wouldn't have been so bad so you know

1019
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,259
some resources for you there and there

1020
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,500
are other ones out there obviously that

1021
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,500
are there available another pitfall

1022
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:55,360
lack of knowledge of legal frameworks

1023
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:58,230
right because you're not the NSA or the

1024
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,340
FBI or even your local police department

1025
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:02,860
you don't get certain kinds of

1026
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,480
protections that they might for certain

1027
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,210
kinds of things you don't have certain

1028
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,320
restrictions that they might but you

1029
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:15,640
also don't get certain kinds of

1030
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:18,840
protections when does your you know kind

1031
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,339
of efforts to try to keep tabs on

1032
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,770
members of your community who you feel

1033
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:26,080
are hazardous to you move out of the

1034
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,330
realm of this is something I'm doing for

1035
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:32,140
my protection and into this is when I'm

1036
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:34,150
stalking you right like I made a mention

1037
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,529
earlier of like you know putting a

1038
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,610
camera in somebody's house right

1039
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,410
obviously if you don't have permission

1040
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:42,220
to do that all right you're breaking the

1041
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:43,839
law I'm not a as I mentioned before I'm

1042
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,450
not a lawyer so I'm not gonna advise you

1043
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,340
on anything here but like talk to a

1044
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,680
lawyer right like if this isn't just

1045
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:53,080
some kind of one-off thing that you're

1046
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,490
doing for yourself or your local friends

1047
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,049
for fun if this is something that you

1048
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,549
really care about and you're planning on

1049
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:01,390
starting up your own little micro firm

1050
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:03,700
over by a couple hours of a lawyer's

1051
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:06,430
time so that you understand where the

1052
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:11,319
thresholds are and and can protect

1053
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:14,080
yourself accordingly lack of

1054
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:17,560
institutional support right like when

1055
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:20,560
things go sideways at the at the NSA or

1056
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,440
the CIA or something like that there are

1057
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,400
a whole bunch of people who can protect

1058
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,340
them right

1059
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:31,360
they've got folks who can cover up

1060
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:34,570
mistakes or make backstories or even

1061
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:37,930
like provide other kinds of logistical

1062
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:39,550
or monetary support if you're flying

1063
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:42,910
solo or even if it's just you and a

1064
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:45,850
couple of your friends you don't have

1065
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:49,420
that flexibility right an operational

1066
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:51,730
setback could be the end of what you're

1067
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:56,800
working on right that could spell of the

1068
00:47:51,730 --> 00:48:00,700
closure of your shop so you know keeping

1069
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,480
in mind that you can kind of counter

1070
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,939
this by just being calm

1071
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,609
of this restriction trying your best

1072
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,079
supply you know whatever tradecraft

1073
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:11,720
practices you can manage not

1074
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,609
overextending yourself and you know

1075
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,109
considered like pop-up or guerilla

1076
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:17,150
structures that can kind of be easily

1077
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:18,890
abandoned like you know well got burned

1078
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:25,190
like just gonna kind of leave this

1079
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:26,750
behind and then what I like to call lack

1080
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,520
of anticipated consequence I don't know

1081
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:37,130
if anybody here in the room was present

1082
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:39,829
for the 130 out in the other room over

1083
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:43,070
there David evidence Jedi mammoth his

1084
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:47,510
1:30 presentation about unintended

1085
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:50,540
consequences of working in an

1086
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:55,609
environment that he worked in was very

1087
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:59,060
severe for him again right he's an actor

1088
00:48:55,609 --> 00:49:03,078
who was working with with folks in the

1089
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:05,779
top 10% so the level of consequence he

1090
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:09,619
faced was much higher but like if you

1091
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:11,780
decide child trafficking is something

1092
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:15,619
you want to follow up on you're gonna

1093
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:18,920
see some things or or learn about some

1094
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:21,740
things that maybe you didn't wish you

1095
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,710
knew now and when you combine that with

1096
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,750
the lack of institutional support from

1097
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:30,140
our previous slide right like they've

1098
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:34,010
got psychologists on staff to help them

1099
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,290
with you know PTSD complex PTSD and

1100
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:39,050
things like that

1101
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:42,859
they've got folks who can quickly

1102
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:44,839
extract them if if things go south and

1103
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:49,640
and adversaries are starting to beat

1104
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:51,859
down their door if you draw the wrong

1105
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,540
kind of attention to yourself by your

1106
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:55,369
local hate group because you're

1107
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,630
concerned about your your well-being and

1108
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:58,490
you're just trying to keep tabs on them

1109
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:00,140
and they decide they want to show up out

1110
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:05,810
in front of their how front of your

1111
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:11,098
house with trucks and torches right you

1112
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:13,769
kind of on your own and I don't

1113
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,329
I don't want to overplay the

1114
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:18,149
significance of that or the likelihood

1115
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:20,130
of that happening but from a personal

1116
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:22,200
perspective I don't have a slide on this

1117
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:26,400
because I'm trying to be somewhat

1118
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:28,799
respectful but from a personal

1119
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,269
perspective there are two people in my

1120
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:32,999
life one on different ends of the

1121
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:35,279
political spectrum who essentially were

1122
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:41,328
bullied into in the committing suicide

1123
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:43,880
as a result of either direct or indirect

1124
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:47,519
personal intelligence related actions um

1125
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:50,220
one of them was doing investigation into

1126
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,649
the money trails behind certain kinds of

1127
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:56,970
campaign influence related stuff back in

1128
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:59,970
2016 and the level of bullying he

1129
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:04,950
receives combined both virtually and

1130
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:07,439
physically combined with some underlying

1131
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,739
mental issues resulted in him taking his

1132
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,690
own life

1133
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:15,690
on the flip side of that the

1134
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:19,469
transgendered son of a friend of my

1135
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:23,729
family's was reported on in a local

1136
00:51:19,469 --> 00:51:25,650
paper the struggles of trying to go to

1137
00:51:23,729 --> 00:51:27,718
school just go to school where I'd get

1138
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:30,930
an education when you're in the process

1139
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:34,079
of transitioning as a kid a local

1140
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:37,469
politician decided that they'd wanted to

1141
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,210
make a point and got into a polemic

1142
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:41,519
about it and got there their base riled

1143
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:43,499
up and their base decided to stand up a

1144
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,828
little Intel firm and they found out who

1145
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:48,779
that person was and bullied them

1146
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:53,579
successfully into first quitting school

1147
00:51:48,779 --> 00:51:56,160
and then you know he he waited until he

1148
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:58,200
was at least an adult before he

1149
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:02,670
