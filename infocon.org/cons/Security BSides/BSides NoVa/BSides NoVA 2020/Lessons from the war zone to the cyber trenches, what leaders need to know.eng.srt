1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
the ambulance is it flies and so not a

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,379
big deal I'm sitting in my operation

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,240
center have a bunch of captains who have

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,879
like 5 to 7 years of experience ones are

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,710
listed folks about 10 to 15 years of

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,849
experience we're just monitoring all of

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,460
our stuff so thinking about being in a

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,080
sock of or some kind of operation cell

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,770
just monitoring what's going on again

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,479
not a big deal

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,759
great normal day until about 11:15 when

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,730
we get a medical evacuation request from

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,030
northern Afghanistan again not not a big

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,180
deal do it all the time

15
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:39,000
aircraft take off they show up and have

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,760
you ever heard the term hot LZ like it

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,469
you're watching a movie and hot LZ or

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,360
hot landing zone that means something

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,530
bad is happening that means that when

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,120
the helicopters go to where they're

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,360
supposed to go that they're being shot

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,399
at that's like a bad day just a normal

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,750
bad day it's worse in a medical

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,879
evacuation aircraft because they don't

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,530
have guns on them because they can't

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,760
because there's the Geneva Convention

27
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,500
that makes it a worst day so I'm 500

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,320
miles away in my talk my operation

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,080
center watching this go down they are

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,339
500 miles away in northern Afghanistan

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,960
dealing with the situation and the

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,270
person who's actually managing the fight

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,250
so to speak is a 19 year old private

34
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:22,590
first class she had only been in the

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,679
army 18 months but she's in charge

36
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,210
so my officers who are really smart are

37
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:29,280
really trying to message this individual

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,689
ask her a lot of questions as these

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,520
aircraft are trying to land and save

40
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,079
lives

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,369
at that moment have to stop my team and

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,548
just say shut up stop she has to fight

43
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:46,408
she has the fight the 19 year old is in

44
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,119
charge but well fast forward force the

45
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,500
Erawan get saved they save eight german

46
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,469
soldiers they get the second-highest

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,720
medal given by the german government

48
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:56,720
then the 19 year old was in charge

49
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:04,439
what organization on the planet gives 18

50
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,560
to 24 year olds the kind of

51
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:12,900
responsibility to save lives and be in

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:15,540
charge when crisis happens your US Army

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,329
anyone in department defense we do it

54
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,010
every day and so over the course of this

55
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:21,930
talk we're going to share with you a

56
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,420
couple of frameworks that drive an

57
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,319
organization to move in the same

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,839
direction 1.2 million people same way

59
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:33,810
every day around the globe and how we

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,630
empower others to and develop trust in

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,030
order to be able to put a

62
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,230
nineteen-year-old in charge when it

63
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,790
really matters analyzer at risk so the

64
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,608
talk is titled from the war zone to the

65
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,099
cyber trenches what leaders need to know

66
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:52,709
you are the leaders of this community

67
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,018
that's discipline we're the ones who are

68
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,489
making the decisions we are that 18 19

69
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,579
year old or in my case just a little bit

70
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:02,370
older than that who need to be empowered

71
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:05,599
or empower people to make decisions so

72
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,849
as we get started you're gonna hear some

73
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,950
practical things we've done and all of

74
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,690
us are now in different positions and

75
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,959
we're no longer in service except for

76
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,799
one of us and we're now applying that to

77
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,049
a higher level discussion to enable

78
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,970
cyber cyber security so let's start with

79
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,760
some introductions and we'll start with

80
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,599
Chris do you mind introducing yourself

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,540
absolutely so I'm Chris Quebec oh and I

82
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,649
deal a lot in the cyber warfare space

83
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,400
when dealing with nation-state

84
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:41,830
incident management and also dealing

85
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,290
with strategy between the European Union

86
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,700
the US and now because the United

87
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,670
Kingdom is separate also the United

88
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,149
Kingdom because we're major trading bloc

89
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:55,089
partners if one particular Ally Falls

90
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,700
that can affect the rest of the allies

91
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,500
supply chain think about things that are

92
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,268
going on with coronavirus right now

93
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,060
where certain things are in short supply

94
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,799
because production has been lowered in

95
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,280
China and other places in the world

96
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:13,239
especially like Germany - so that's my

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,810
particular space and one of the things

98
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,060
that I did previous to setting up my own

99
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,200
company was I was the person that Saudi

100
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,419
Aramco called

101
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,120
after they were hit with a cyber warfare

102
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:27,909
attack by the Iranians in 2012 called

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,090
the Shamoon attacks and I had to apply a

104
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,330
lot of my background from the military

105
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,969
to an extremely major international

106
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,710
incident to try to reestablish which I

107
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:45,669
did their international business

108
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:48,340
operations and scramble teams hi my name

109
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:51,039
is Colonel hi Skipton I'm a US Army

110

the Unites States Military Academy where

117
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,260
my expertise is raw operational

118
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,340
effective effectiveness intersect with

119
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,830
human capital development

120
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,719
I teach system engineering folks around

121
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,520
the idea of systems thinking how do you

122
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,919
deal with ambiguity how do you deal with

123
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,919
crisis and just excited to just share

124
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm retired Army colonel JC Vega

125
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,490
executive security advisor now in the

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,550
private sector been in the military for

127
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,830
30 years one of the founders of the

128
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,780
cyber career field and the army cyber

129
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,430
Institute and I've been doing cyber

130
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:42,969
before cyber cyber competed in CTF at

131
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,740
DEFCON Alexis Park way back when and now

132
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,500
I'm just happy to be here and share some

133
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,889
of these experiences with you and so

134
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,669
let's start with what

135
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:55,189
you've talked about dependencies and

136
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:56,870
safety what about it how does that

137
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:00,710
translate between the military and what

138
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,620
we're doing now well surely after I

139
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,969
joined a Ramco very shortly after we had

140
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,680
a different type of crisis we're a

141
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:09,319
nation-state actually leveraged our

142
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,870
central antivirus system to try to get

143
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,749
into a joint venture that happened to

144
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,789
involve nuclear facility the new coal

145
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:22,159
power plants and this particular

146
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:25,938
adversary used us as that pivot point we

147
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:29,210
were not the direct target and at the

148
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:32,330
same time as this was going on there

149
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,489
were also minor acts of terrorism going

150
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,479
on in the particular country where this

151
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:42,409
joint venture was located so I quickly

152
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,360
had to select the people that could go

153
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:47,719
out to that country and had the

154
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,270
capability to go on the ground and

155
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:54,020
assess the incidence and at the same

156
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,818
time keep back and figure out different

157
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,409
crisis management plans because we also

158
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:00,439
had a lot of employees in that

159
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:02,960
particular country and we had to be very

160
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,550
concerned with them and their families

161
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,960
to make sure that we could get them out

162
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,899
of that country as quickly as possible

163
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,878
and if this particular nation-state also

164
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:13,610
took out our telecommunication systems

165
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:17,270
in that area and also for that country

166
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:20,300
we had to have alternate communications

167
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,729
but because of the seriousness I thought

168
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,500
well you know I mean gosh shouldn't I go

169
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,469
but at the same time I need to empower

170
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,979
that individual that I'm sending out

171
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:33,080
because I can't do everything at all but

172
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,539
here is a major issue where we're

173
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,159
talking about a nuclear facility where

174
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,560
people can get hurt we're talking about

175
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:43,520
acts of terrorism where people can get

176
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,029
hurt and we need to make sure that we're

177
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,060
kept as safe as possible and one of the

178
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,399
issues that we now face when it comes to

179
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,819
digital security is it isn't just a

180
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,969
breach of a database or a problem with

181
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:00,440
your antivirus what if a nation-state

182
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:01,980
uses your central antivirus system

183
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,140
against you

184
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:08,880
and causes a real safety issue so that's

185
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:13,680
basically my major concern with digital

186
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:17,400
security right now I think that's a

187
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,840
great point because is if we look at how

188
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,549
we operate and how we're going to

189
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,830
operate in the future that that

190
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,620
vulnerability aspect around all of our

191
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,620
systems is a real thing that we train

192
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,020
for every day there's a place not too

193
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,880
far from Erie and Louisiana where called

194
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,710
the joint Readiness Training Center

195
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,740
every month your Army is practicing and

196
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,919
we practice war how to prosecute it and

197
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,620
we it's a very intense environment and

198
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,290
we test these vulnerabilities on a daily

199
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,540
basis to see how units react then how do

200
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,699
we improve and so this is very similar

201
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,130
how you may need to operate within your

202
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,540
own organizations or your own personal

203
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,760
perspective how are you training

204
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,829
yourselves to deal with issues of

205
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,930
vulnerability are you actually testing

206
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,790
the wire so to speak to find out where

207
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,489
the fragility exists in order for you

208
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,189
then to be better the next time you're

209
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,290
hacked you know you you mentioned Chris

210
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:17,100
that you weren't the target you were the

211
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:20,030
pivot point so the idea that we have

212
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,770
this inter dependency this connectedness

213
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,260
but I may not be the intended target but

214
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:29,880
I'm being used by somebody else because

215
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:32,850
I'm not important I'm no one or my

216
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,500
system is not relevant but in fact it is

217
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,980
because other people understand our

218
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,560
network better than we do and the fact

219
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,210
that that translates from from digital

220
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,540
from zeros and ones to kinetic impact I

221
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:54,750
remember more than a decade ago there

222
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:58,020
was no proven instance public where a

223
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:02,430
cyber attack had any kinetic effect and

224
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:05,010
that is yesterday so in high C you

225
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:09,709
mentioned in your discussion this

226
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:12,510
concept of how we're organized and and

227
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,010
how you trained and prepared for this

228
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,040
nineteen year old can you get into that

229
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:20,910
zone

230
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,260
that sure the idea that the the firm

231
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,860
were that we lover to the military that

232
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,390
moves no matter what service you're in

233
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,190
in the same direction of brought that

234
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,350
unit of effort it's called mission

235
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,490
command I would say that we can't with

236
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,420
it all by ourselves

237
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,400
but we borrowed it from like Napoleon in

238
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,709
1806 and so the idea of mission command

239
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,790
is this idea of central search command

240
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:46,680
decentralized operations why is that

241
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,280
important because what we learn from

242
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Napoleon is that when he was being

243
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,560
pressed and was put in a situation where

244
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,290
there was a two-front war and he's

245
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,689
outnumbered two to one it's not the

246
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,430
Prussians he actually won and when

247
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,910
Clausewitz unpacked what actually

248
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:09,739
happened during these battles he found

249
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:13,260
that Napoleon's soldiers and officers

250
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,480
could operate in a manner and execute

251
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,360
his intent without him being there if we

252
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,550
think about 1806 or so there's no

253
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,940
snapchat Facebook Twitter Instagram or

254
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:27,030
slack so how is it that those officers

255
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:32,010
and soldiers could operate with only his

256
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:36,300
intense and developed situation in real

257
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:38,280
time in order to leverage and exercise

258
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,140
discipline ishutin that's what mission

259
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,140
command comes from because of art side

260
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,060
to it and a science the artists soft as

261
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,710
an engineer that's a soft stuff nothing

262
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,199
against anyone who has a awesome liberal

263
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,970
arts education but art to me I'm not

264
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,770
artistically inclined like my daughters

265
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:57,690
are so the idea building mutual trust

266
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,819
but that's a principle the idea of

267
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,280
exercise and discipline ishutin there is

268
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,580
indiscipline initiative but for instance

269
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,890
my 19 year old PFC private first class

270
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,920
exercise discipline initiative when

271
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:15,360
given charge of that major issue on

272
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:17,400
April 10th 2010 the idea of how do you

273
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,170
communicate providing some kind of

274
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,970
mission orders we communicate in a very

275
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,130
specific way in the military if you talk

276
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,540
to anyone who says up or operations

277
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,100
order they understand the information

278
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,110
that's about to come to them that's a

279
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,889
way to communicate creating shared

280
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,309
understand

281
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:34,039
and then this idea of risk you only

282
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:37,259
accept the risk based on your boss

283
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:39,239
whether it dares prudent risk based on

284
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,329
your experience in the last things is

285
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:44,249
idea of commander's intent why are we

286
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,108
doing something what's required to do

287
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:49,289
something and how do you want this thing

288
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:51,599
to end those are the principles which

289
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:54,659
drives what we do in each of those

290
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:58,289
principles is a class by themselves but

291
00:12:54,659 --> 00:13:01,649
that's how we were able to drive 1.2

292
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:05,029
million people same way same day 24/7

293
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:10,829
and empower others to get things done

294
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:13,289
right in the issue you know that's real

295
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:16,169
good insight that you have there how we

296
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:18,809
have this framework and the way I've

297
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:22,049
adopted that commander's intent in the

298
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:25,199
cyber world is from a compliance

299
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:27,569
perspective I was in charge of a major

300
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:30,539
Network for the largest fighting

301
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:33,748
organization in the army and I was told

302
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:37,529
to accredit the network and there was a

303
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:39,509
checklist that went on for days and I

304
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:43,349
asked my leadership which what do you

305
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:47,759
want do you want an accredited network

306
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:51,539
or do you want a secure network because

307
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:54,989
they're not the same thing tell me what

308
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:58,529
your commander's intent is what do you

309
00:13:54,989 --> 00:14:02,669
want because I could I only have the

310
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:04,829
resources to do one but having that

311
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:07,139
clear guidance and me able to

312
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:11,189
communicate that back to him and his

313
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:15,779
language that he understood I was able

314
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:18,539
to make advances on both sides and what

315
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:21,059
we accomplished both they were not in

316
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,559
the order that he anticipated and it

317
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,889
took us longer than they had anticipated

318
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:29,728
but the idea of understanding those

319
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:31,259
differences it really helps to have a

320
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:33,880
framework that you can follow that you

321
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:40,600
all have a common knowledge of

322
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:46,540
I mean I was at a Ramco I was in charge

323
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:49,630
of basically trying to ensure that the

324
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,540
oil kept flowing that someone couldn't

325
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:55,210
remotely shut it off someone couldn't

326
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,360
affect a supply chain around the world

327
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:01,260
for a shortage of petroleum forcing the

328
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,310
price to go up and very possibly

329
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:08,590
affecting a lot of different countries

330
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:12,010
and communities and knowing exactly what

331
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:16,150
the company wanted me to do and their

332
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:18,640
intent was extremely empowering and I

333
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:21,640
was able to put that back to the people

334
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,310
who worked under me to also empower them

335
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,610
by making sure that they knew what the

336
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:30,449
intent was they had to act very very

337
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,000
quickly we were constantly attacked

338
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:36,250
every single day by one nation state or

339
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,630
another nation state or a activist group

340
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,280
or because we processed a lot of money

341
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:47,110
very very very sophisticated cyber

342
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:50,890
criminals and gangs and in order to be

343
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:53,050
effective at what we were doing we had

344
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:56,500
to be empowered and the people under me

345
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,910
also had to be empowered to know that

346
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,410
they didn't have to make twenty

347
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,930
different phone calls to shut off a

348
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,060
segment of a network that they just did

349
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,979
it and then would communicate what was

350
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,000
going on if they saw something that was

351
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,760
at a very high risk and that's one thing

352
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,660
that I don't see very often and a lot of

353
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:22,290
organizations is empowering individuals

354
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:25,480
who have to act very very quickly so as

355
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,790
we we talk about these these frameworks

356
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,100
and you talked about the joint Readiness

357
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,709
Training Center and being able to act

358
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,920
quickly it reminds me of this concept

359
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,920
that we use called train like you fight

360
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:42,510
fight like you train so here's my no

361
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,010
joke there I was story I'm sitting there

362
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,600
preparing this organization to go to

363
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,110
Iraq we're about to close a rack down

364
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,500
we're

365
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:54,940
the second top priority in the army for

366
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:58,060
in the DoD for network support and we're

367
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,010
getting ready to deploy the only other

368
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,969
unit that has a higher priority is the

369
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,589
one that's in there that we're replacing

370
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:09,160
we're doing our final test and

371
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:12,000
evaluation our major exercise and I get

372
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,390
a call from an outside agency that says

373
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,819
there's something on your network it's

374
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:22,080
doing these things

375
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:25,689
it's beaconing calling home going down

376
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,990
this IP address these port numbers and

377
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,130
it's scanning everything what does that

378
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,320
mean we're trying to figure it out I

379
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,150
have all my experts here I have a green

380
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,889
team a blue team and a red team we all

381
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,270
know what a red team is right a red team

382
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,250
is someone who's aggressing you so we're

383
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,620
being tested on our network the blue

384
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,580
team is someone who's helping us fix

385
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,560
things they're extra help to help us get

386
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,480
get ready and the green team is the one

387
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,580
who is advising us they're experts who

388
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,800
are sitting side by side this call was

389
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,720
on our secret network and this wasn't

390
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,430
something that was scripted or something

391
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,270
we expected so I immediately call

392
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:07,810
everyone is this part of the exercise no

393
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,250
it's not okay so we really have

394
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,080
something going on here someone is

395
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,350
testing us this is a closed network

396
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,610
you're not supposed to be in here and

397
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,250
then my Chief Warrant Officer comes up

398
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,979
and says hey we got a problem what

399
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:28,000
remember the one computer they told us

400
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:34,720
it's now - it's now four it's now 16 32

401
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,740
64 holy cow what's going on here

402
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,990
so I immediately go to our chief

403
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,230
information officer I was a CISO this is

404
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,720
before the CISO reports to the CIO an

405
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,909
army speak

406
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,059
the security guy works for the g6 and

407
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:55,390
then he reports up to the general and I

408
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:59,080
told the generalists it's sir or the g6

409
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,809
the CIO sir you need to let the general

410
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,780
know who owns the network what's going

411
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:07,690
on and my recommendation is that we shut

412
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:10,870
the network down we're in the middle of

413
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,690
a major exercise across the country

414
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,908
talking to units in in country and and

415
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:21,909
all these things are coordinating what

416
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:27,610
do you think he said to me I'm not

417
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:30,760
telling him you tell him that gave me a

418
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:35,199
lot of confidence and what we had going

419
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,879
on here I did end up telling him and he

420
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,169
turned to me and he said shut it off let

421
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,429
me know what's next steps are gonna be

422
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,860
and you know when you have your next

423
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:45,610
update and he went on he went about his

424
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:49,049
business it didn't stop there

425
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:51,459
I'm in a major installation I called

426
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,960
every major command that was there and

427
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,169
all the experts that we knew in the

428
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,270
network hey this is what I'm seeing we

429
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:02,710
can't figure it out can you you guys

430
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:05,020
help us out everybody said we've never

431
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,390
seen this either this is new to us you

432
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,460
know the concept of you know getting the

433
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,289
IOC s and all those things here and

434
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,039
sharing them and all that stuff we're

435
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:17,789
new concepts so I sent up a red star

436
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,919
cluster that that's the help anybody

437
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:24,010
around I need help and in this case here

438
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,830
the army computer emergency response

439
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,890
team the our cert was something

440
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,970
relatively new called them said I need

441
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:37,520
help

442
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:38,650
their response was we got this pull out

443
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,770
the hard drives

444
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:47,210
FedEx them to us and we'll let you know

445
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:52,070
if there's anything of interest we're

446
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,350
going to war this is not this isn't our

447
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:59,200
life they said our career adulthood life

448
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:02,120
not lifetime yeah it's real comforting

449
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,550
what we realized then and that was when

450
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,800
I really put on my evangelist hat saying

451
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,330
we got to change this in the army and

452
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,460
we've done a lot of things since then

453
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,260
and people in this room have been a part

454
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,270
of that journey in changing the army and

455
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,220
changing the Armed Forces so thank you

456
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:19,070
all because a lot of you have had a

457
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,790
significant impact on this but the

458
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:25,100
important thing is I realized then that

459
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,629
had we not trained like we fight fight

460
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,580
like we trained I would not have

461
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,070
realized we would not have realized that

462
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,070
there is no cavalry out there you got

463
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,510
what you got you know they said you

464
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,100
don't go to war with the team you want

465
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,590
or the army you want you're the one with

466
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,129
you go to war with the one you have ours

467
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:45,409
was lacking and so you have to practice

468
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,600
in that environment because when this

469
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,910
really does happen and what you expect

470
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,290
and what you're going to get there may

471
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,290
be a significant Delta

472
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:01,980
I think it's very very important to

473
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:03,570
stress practicing things now when you

474
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,120
practice something it's not going to be

475
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:09,389
exactly the same as the actual incident

476
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,000
but they're going to be a lot of

477
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:15,720
different steps that are going to be

478
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,980
very similar and if you don't practice

479
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,169
you definitely will not be prepared from

480
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,190
my first career in the military I was a

481
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:29,130
c5 loadmaster and we used a lot of

482
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,650
checklists to ensure that things were

483
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,210
done and done safely and one thing that

484
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,820
we absolutely had to do without a

485
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,790
checklist was to be able to put out an

486
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,820
engine fire and to know the steps to do

487
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,850
that and it was to reach up twist pull

488
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,100
and if you didn't know that and you were

489
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,580
tested on it just even randomly you

490
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,399
could not fly for at least six weeks and

491
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,610
had to basically go back for training

492
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,200
and of course nobody wanted that but

493
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,689
that helped out significantly because

494
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,790
one time we had an engine fire and I was

495
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:05,640
in the cockpit and I instantly reached

496
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:08,129
up and put that engine fire out because

497
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,640
of that muscle memory because knowing

498
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,669
exactly what to do when you have an

499
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,590
incident who are you supposed to call

500
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:21,360
first do you have that information handy

501
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,659
immediately on your person what are the

502
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,010
first three steps that you need to take

503
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,049
and to get that into your muscle memory

504
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,870
and also practice that to make sure that

505
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:33,120
numbers are working and things of that

506
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:36,689
nature so it's very important to do

507
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:41,520
these things and I think your idea reps

508
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,960
are is a very very important and the the

509
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,370
understanding that is not through

510
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,590
serendipity that you're going to be able

511
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,350
to just to react when it happens it's as

512
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:51,059
if if you like any sports if you like

513
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,340
any kind of sports team they just don't

514
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,350
show up in the championship game there's

515
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,110
a lot of practice that happens a lot of

516
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,850
games that happen and you can actually

517
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,168
create those kind of game situations in

518
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,620
your own organizations or through your

519
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:06,600
own processes to ensure that when things

520
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,518
happen you have that muscle memory

521
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,289
because - that

522
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,570
you trying to figure things out and then

523
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:16,169
that's when you realize your process

524
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:18,779
your plan is flawed and your people are

525
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:26,279
not equipped to deal with the situation

526
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:28,619
at hand one of the worst things that can

527
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,690
occur when you've got a major issue

528
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,488
going on within your organization when

529
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,999
it comes to some sort of digital attack

530
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:38,129
is what happened with Saudi Aramco when

531
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:40,859
they were attacked for Shamoon they had

532
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:42,779
no paper copies for contact lists

533
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:45,269
everything was on the SharePoint the

534
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:47,279
SharePoint was wiped out they did not

535
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:50,190
have regular phones ahead voice over IP

536
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,409
phones those were wiped out they had to

537
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,119
disconnect from the internet they lost

538
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:57,179
the vast majority of their computers

539
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,579
about 85% of their computer systems they

540
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:03,179
had never practiced they never thought

541
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:07,499
that it would be a risk and it cost we

542
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:10,859
estimated around I would say seven to

543
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:13,289
nine billion dollars to recover that

544
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:18,149
company how many of your organization's

545
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:20,309
have seven to nine billion if not how

546
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:23,488
many jobs would be lost and how many

547
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:26,399
organizations would be basically

548
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:28,320
plummeting to the ground on fire like if

549
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:31,708
it was an aircraft if you didn't know at

550
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,309
least the first steps on what to do or

551
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:38,940
who to call so it's something to

552
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:43,129
definitely keep in mind so you talked

553
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,679
about that having that plan and those

554
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:51,029
some of those things are dependencies

555
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,889
and we have a plan at almost all of our

556
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:54,629
organizations call it a playbook call it

557
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:58,109
a standard operating procedures call it

558
00:25:54,629 --> 00:26:00,899
a response plan whatever it is but

559
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:04,468
what's your part of the plan and can you

560
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:08,820
do those steps without having to go to

561
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:11,849
the book that may not be where you think

562
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:15,509
it is it may be digital and it's not

563
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:18,040
accessible and so what I often ask a

564
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:21,130
group of executives

565
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:24,940
as who are you gonna call outside of

566
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:27,730
your organization what's their phone

567
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,660
number when's the last time you talked

568
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:34,780
to that person and have you interacted

569
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,100
to where they know back to the train

570
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,170
like you fight fight like a train

571
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,949
you know what capability and capacity

572
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,000
they have and you know what you have or

573
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,760
don't have

574
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,590
and are they going to fulfill that need

575
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,160
so if you have someone on your Incident

576
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:52,840
Response who's on retainer are you their

577
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,890
number 1 when you call them or are you

578
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,590
their number 3 number 4 number 5 what is

579
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:05,470
that response actually going to look

580
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:07,179
like have you practiced that and so as

581
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,070
you're hearing and as you all know I

582
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,350
mean you're living in a puka world I'm

583
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,899
gonna say bucha a vulnerable uncertain

584
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,540
complex and because environment and what

585
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,240
we've described is this I what's

586
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,649
required in this bucha world is that

587
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,990
what I would call operational leadership

588
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:25,120
so uh not only understanding technology

589
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:27,130
but you also have to understand process

590
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,629
you also have to understand your people

591
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:32,230
and a couple of things you've heard

592
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,900
already there's great technology but was

593
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,720
there a plan there's great technology

594
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,090
but we had no process to execute the

595
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,220
plan there's great technology there's no

596
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,639
process they don't wait actually to plan

597
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:50,170
oh my gosh my people aren't trained on

598
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,300
that and so the point is that the idea

599
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:55,090
of operational leadership helps bridges

600
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,700
the gap so you can have this lofty

601
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,590
vision and idea you can have some things

602
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:04,450
you have to do but if you don't

603
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:06,699
understand how to bridge from lofty idea

604
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:10,360
to getting things done there's a huge

605
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,460
blind spot but by understanding I would

606
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,320
argue operational leadership take the

607
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,570
intersection for technology process and

608
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,030
plans allows you to be able to bridge

609
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:23,419
the gap to ensure that you're prepared

610
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:27,500
when the crisis happens not if

611
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:32,090
I think it's also very important to

612
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,430
stress that win because nowadays

613
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,750
does anyone here in this room think that

614
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:42,470
their data has never been breached

615
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:45,380
nobody because almost every single

616
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,600
organization has gone through something

617
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:52,310
like that our data is all over the place

618
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,770
just about everywhere so it we used to

619
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:57,560
think years ago that it was something

620
00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:01,340
rather exotic to experience a major

621
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:04,159
incident and now it's just another very

622
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,409
small news item that you might see on

623
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,300
Twitter or on the internet or whatever

624
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,810
and you just shrug it off because it

625
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,570
happened so often yet so few

626
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:17,120
organizations actually prepare for

627
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:23,080
something that they should know by now

628
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:26,590
will happen so to go back to Napoleon

629
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,490
and kind of transition a little bit here

630
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,780
he has a quote that I'm going to

631
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,880
paraphrase because they don't remember

632
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,000
it exactly but he says if it looks like

633
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,450
if it appears that I know what you're

634
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,600
doing before you do or that it appears

635
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:44,300
that I have your plan it is because I

636
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,050
have rehearsed it and gone over in my

637
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:50,570
mind all the possibilities so what we

638
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:52,550
call that is intelligence preparation of

639
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,040
the battlespace or intelligence

640
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:57,169
preparation of the battlefield and there

641
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,129
are several parts to that it's a process

642
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:03,650
that we use and the idea behind that is

643
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:09,230
to analyze the threats that are out

644
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:14,390
there so the enemy what are they likely

645
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:16,300
to do what is their MO how are they

646
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,790
likely to do it what's their motivation

647
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:22,940
what's the most likely activity or

648
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:25,940
action what tools do they use what

649
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:31,010
processes do they use so that you have a

650
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:33,590
come under standing about them as you

651
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:36,470
possibly can just like you study a

652
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,240
fighter just like you study a Europe

653
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,650
on a football team you know they're a

654
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,500
running team you know they're a throwing

655
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:46,280
team I'm going to prepare my defenses

656
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:50,059
against them based on everything that I

657
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:55,610
can possibly know but it doesn't stop

658
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:58,879
there that preparation includes look at

659
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:03,918
the friendly environment to look at all

660
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,890
the assets you have available to you I'm

661
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,710
sure most of you here have responded to

662
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:12,590
some type of crisis in your life

663
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:17,169
personally or professionally and I would

664
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:20,449
guess that most of you if not all of you

665
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:24,559
required some outside assistance of some

666
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:29,330
sort you didn't solve this crisis by

667
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:31,520
yourself you had to reach out so the

668
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,158
idea of looking at the assets you have

669
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,200
available to you if you think of your if

670
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,510
you're a large organization you have

671
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,210
your in your team that you're a part of

672
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,830
that you work in day in day out but

673
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,020
expand that out what are the

674
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,870
directorate's or divisions that are left

675
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:51,650
and right of you what do they bring to

676
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:55,489
your fight if this was a crisis now look

677
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:57,950
outside of that look at the coordinated

678
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:00,500
response if it's larger than that we

679
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,870
work with New York City and they have

680
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,220
this organization called the CCSI that's

681
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,709
a bunch of critical infrastructure

682
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,539
groups that come together and they train

683
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,539
about a couple times a year with my

684
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:14,120
organization and it's the private sector

685
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:17,710
and it's the public sector from the DEA

686
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:21,770
law enforcement Fire Department

687
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:26,620
Department of Energy other private

688
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:29,629
sector elements to include banking

689
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,820
energy their con Ed's a private sector

690
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:33,799
they all come together and they practice

691
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,770
how they would actually respond to a

692
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,850
crisis that was at the scope bigger than

693
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:41,700
themselves

694
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:44,699
and how would they leverage that the

695
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:49,710
idea is to identify the capability of

696
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:52,710
capacity and capacity of the threat the

697
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:55,520
capability and capacity of your partners

698
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:59,520
or those you have dependencies are in

699
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:05,720
the last part what is your true

700
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:10,260
capability and capacity know yourself if

701
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:13,860
you have the possibility where you could

702
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:17,100
handle all of these things if they

703
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,919
happen separately if they all came at

704
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,750
you at once you could only really

705
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,550
address maybe one or two or three of

706
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,340
those things but you can't do that so

707
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:29,790
you have to know when do you need help

708
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,389
what's that trigger and practice that in

709
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,950
advance

710
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:37,350
so that when you call and you reach out

711
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:42,510
you know how you're adding value to your

712
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:46,740
team how they're augmenting not making

713
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:49,370
it more difficult and that includes your

714
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,440
state local and federal for some of you

715
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:58,560
and I know there are some feds in here I

716
00:33:52,440 --> 00:34:01,860
know who you are they are there they do

717
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:08,100
want to help you they can help you more

718
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:09,989
in advance of a crisis then after we'd

719
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,020
like to think as you train and prepare

720
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:15,120
for your crisis as if it's a Super Bowl

721
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,699
every possible element that you can

722
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,469
control influence you did but if you

723
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:23,250
wait till the time of the crisis to

724
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:25,980
prepare it's gonna turn out more like a

725
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,960
pickup game whoever is on the playground

726
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,940
at that time and the best play you could

727
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,429
run is go ten steps turn around I'm

728
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:36,510
going to throw the ball at you and this

729
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:38,879
may be a career-ending a monumental

730
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,890
experience for your organization that

731
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,079
for some they will not survive

732
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:48,449
the post crisis response

733
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:50,129
and I think something that's important

734
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:54,239
that that causes halide this idea of

735
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:55,799
practice and planning and in my travels

736
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,490
over the past couple of years talking to

737
00:34:55,799 --> 00:35:01,980
startup founders and tech companies

738
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:05,759
processes sometimes like kryptonite to

739
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:09,559
the startup founder the idea of process

740
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,670
will impede my ability to innovate

741
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:12,329
America is made up of a lot of small

742
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,549
companies

743
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:17,039
you cannot scale if you don't have

744
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:18,690
process in planning and so though

745
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,549
although all of us have military

746
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,980
backgrounds they haven't practiced and

747
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:24,780
playing a lot about a lot of different

748
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,700
things because the the price is pretty

749
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,920
high that you have folks who are

750
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,569
deployed around the globe right now that

751
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,000
allow us to sit right here just to have

752
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:34,680
a conversation but they practiced a lot

753
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,359
so we're not we're not really worried

754
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,848
about it but the same thing applies to

755
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,740
to you and your organization's the

756
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,619
Wellness and desire and focus to

757
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:47,098
practice and plan will allow you to

758
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,980
mitigate the reputational risk when bad

759
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,720
things happen because when something bad

760
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,359
happens in all of our organizations now

761
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,598
the ability to throw out a tweet put on

762
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:00,210
the Facebook Instagram and have some

763
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,160
kind of impact on the market of your

764
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,160
stock price if your publicly traded

765
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,779
company is pretty high so over the

766
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,640
reputational risk what something bad

767
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:12,029
happens will impede your ability to get

768
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,618
more business it's high however you can

769
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:19,950
mitigate that just by taking a moment

770
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:23,099
taking some time and practice and plan

771
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:25,009
and ensure that your people are prepared

772
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:27,370
when something happens

773
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:31,900
[Music]

774
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:36,180
so how many of you think favorably about

775
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:41,080
bowing right now right

776
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:45,569
nobody really a couple of yes right

777
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:50,410
right and because of safety issues

778
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:55,050
caused by software coding errors over

779
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:58,799
three hundred and fifty people died and

780
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:00,630
they were doing a Promoted Tweet

781
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,700
highlighting some of their

782
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:06,130
accomplishments and I noticed that I

783
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,490
took a screenshot of it nobody retweeted

784
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:11,170
it and there was only one reply of can't

785
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,990
believe you're a major defense

786
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,730
contractor why don't you figure out how

787
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:19,450
to make your civilian aircraft safe

788
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:25,030
before you go into the space of

789
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:29,740
weaponized aircraft and their reputation

790
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:31,900
hit has been quite big and that can

791
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,029
happen to any company my favorite

792
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:37,330
example is on the Urban Dictionary there

793
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:40,300
used to be up there a word called or Ram

794
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,860
code right because their lack of

795
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,200
preparation and the fact that they

796
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:47,080
almost got obliterated you don't want to

797
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,750
get our RAM code and nobody wants their

798
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,160
organization to have an urban dictionary

799
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,160
entry like that

800
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:05,820
I think we come down in okay I just want

801
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,200
to leave something before we well the

802
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,480
thing that I like to for you to think

803
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,100
about is this the last night shared with

804
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,630
mission command that's idea of commander

805
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,150
and intent there's a lot of things that

806
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,830
we've talked about for the the bottom

807
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,070
line is that those who are in leadership

808
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:22,350
positions or managerial positions and we

809
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:25,320
all think we're also communicators but

810
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,730
we all are challenged in that and so if

811
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,140
we're honest with ourselves got very

812
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,970
smart people that we work with and great

813
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,160
teammates but they don't know why we

814
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,680
want something done you can't get it

815
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,600
done they don't know the key things that

816
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,910
are required to get things done they

817
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,430
can't get things done and the last part

818
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,720
is the end state when we say in state

819
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:47,100
well how do you want the chapter to end

820
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,589
but most leaders don't like providing in

821
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,380
states I'll say these civilian leaders

822
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:55,470
because it causes accountability to

823
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,620
themselves because I tell you how I want

824
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:00,779
it to end if you get there no matter how

825
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:04,680
you do it I cannot hold you accountable

826
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,990
because we're winning but if I tell you

827
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,810
I'll know it when I see it I'm now not

828
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:11,549
accountable as the leader and so these

829
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,830
idea of commander's intent is kind of

830
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:16,020
drilled into how we operate because for

831
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:19,020
every operation that we do we have to

832
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,900
provide our organization's a leaders

833
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:24,240
intent we have to think about why are we

834
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,450
doing something what's required and how

835
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,979
do we want it to end and by doing that

836
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,169
folks can exercise useful initiative

837
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,710
they can be empowered and you as a

838
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:37,860
leader do not have to be in the room you

839
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,750
just know that the team is going towards

840
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,190
this direction

841
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:43,410
they may go straight they may deviate

842
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,180
they may go up they may go down but as

843
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:48,440
long as they get to the end really don't

844
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,220
care but that's the important thing of

845
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,450
commander's intent and that's something

846
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,250
that you can walk away with and you

847
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,319
probably already do it in your own way

848
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:58,020
in your own lexicon within your own

849
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,110
organizations we in the military have

850
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,280
just codified it in a very rigid way so

851
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,100
that it could be leveraged across

852
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,410
multiple organizations so that we all

853
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,490
are speaking the same language and so it

854
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,190
doesn't matter if it's a naval officer

855
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:14,348
an Air Force person or even the Coast

856
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:21,700
Guard we're all speaking the same

857
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:24,609
language when I think about digital

858
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:28,930
security I think about can it lead to

859
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:32,460
someone dying can it lead to a situation

860
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:36,098
where the supply chain is cut off and

861
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,109
something that can start as what one

862
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:41,109
might think is a simple breach can turn

863
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:44,140
into something very major 2014 the Saudi

864
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:46,000
Arabian embassy of The Hague was hacked

865
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,900
by an insider with diplomatic immunity

866
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,300
who had ties to Isis and there was an

867
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,300
extortion demand all the way up to 50

868
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,910
million dollars or that individual and

869
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:01,869
the terrorist group would blow up a

870
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:05,680
national landmark and was threatening to

871
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:08,200
kill over 400 people just because

872
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,290
someone left the password of one two

873
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:14,859
three four five six could have led to

874
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:17,410
the death of over 400 people so we have

875
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:20,380
to start thinking of the very real fact

876
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:23,348
that our modern world is now digital and

877
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,940
that means from safety systems to

878
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:29,820
terrorist groups being able to leverage

879
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:34,330
things and kill actual people so when I

880
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:37,599
again want to stress if you are not

881
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:40,569
practicing and you're not prepared at a

882
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,000
minimal state that could very very very

883
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:44,980
well happen and you might not be the

884
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,700
target you just might be the pivot point

885
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:51,400
but they're going to remember what

886
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:56,020
happened and you might no longer have

887
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:59,250
that organization so we talked a lot

888
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:02,890
about a lot of different some principles

889
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,390
some buzz words some catch phrases you

890
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,868
know train like you fight fight like you

891
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:12,250
train but I want to leave with a

892
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:15,640
takeaway here is that your response your

893
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:19,150
coordination your plan the execution of

894
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:23,290
that is going to move at the speed of

895
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:26,610
trust the trust that your people

896
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:31,500
having you that you have in others that

897
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,500
is developed in advance

898
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:38,430
I attend a lot of events and I mentor a

899
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,920
lot of different groups and individuals

900
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,480
senior and junior on on what do you do

901
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,780
at an event why do you go to use event

902
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,390
how do you how do you how do you manage

903
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,920
how do you maneuver in an event like

904
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,920
this or shmoocon

905
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:59,340
how do you do that here's how you do it

906
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:02,460
and I always tell them mmm the most

907
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:06,450
important thing or outcome that you're

908
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:09,020
going to get from that conference is not

909
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,250
going to be from the people on the stage

910
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:14,700
it's going to be from the people sitting

911
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:18,450
left and right of you this is the

912
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:20,549
cavalry the relationships that you're

913
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:22,560
going to make at a conference like this

914
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:27,450
with people who have a common belief

915
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:30,440
system that security matters the people

916
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:32,970
who are going to respond to your crisis

917
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,100
it's gonna start I used to say with a

918
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:40,140
handshake now it's a fist bump or a

919
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:44,640
elbow bump or a ankle tap or toe tap but

920
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:49,259
that happens here I just met an

921
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,690
individual today Tom it turns out we

922
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,210
actually met at a conference that we

923
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:57,900
were both giving in South Korea three

924
00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:00,090
years ago and our conversation went from

925
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:06,770
you know small talk to oh yeah now we're

926
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:11,250
bros and a lot of you that I met in here

927
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:14,490
or I know I met at another event in the

928
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:17,370
time it takes to develop that trust is

929
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:21,509
over a long period of time not a

930
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:23,819
one-and-done so what I challenge you

931
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,070
with this conference and others like

932
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,960
this is when you leave here to

933
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,640
accelerate that speed of trust in your

934
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,730
organization your professional and

935
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:35,790
personal life there's get a few contacts

936
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,590
from here and follow up follow up in

937
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:41,970
something meaningful have something to

938
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:44,280
offer because you never know when that

939
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:47,490
will come back in spades

940
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,260
you'd be surprised how much someone is

941
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:54,660
willing to help you when they believe in

942
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:57,860
you and sometimes in our business lives

943
00:44:54,660 --> 00:45:01,410
do depend on it and as Chris highlighted

944
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:03,840
that also that digital world is turning

945
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:06,779
into the physical world and all of us

946
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,310
are touching and are affected by it so I

947
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,440
think we have a time for a couple of

948
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,700
questions if anybody wants to ask me

949
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,320
things there's microphones left and

950
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,750
right so if you don't mind getting to a

951
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,800
microphone

952
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,800
[Music]

953
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,980
[Music]

954
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:33,520
there we go I come from other branches

955
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:36,400
and now I work with a new branch and

956
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,860
there have recently got a new CIO who

957
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,600
said that they're willfully inadequate

958
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,300
in their management of cybersecurity and

959
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,400
IT so I wanted to hear from all three of

960
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,830
you knowing coming from Army and coming

961
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,390
from other branches who have solved a

962
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:51,310
lot of these problems what best advice

963
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:54,069
could you give to this other branch to

964
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:56,290
help catch up in relation to the

965
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,340
problems that I described before so you

966
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:59,880
could probably put it together as to

967
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,200
which branch I'm talking about but yeah

968
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,280
III don't know because we've all been

969
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,200
there sure

970
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,250
and I'd like to say at the Army at

971
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,960
advanced tremendously we did it know we

972
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,630
were the last ones to create a cyber

973
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,690
branch a cyber career field and I say

974
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:19,900
out of the Army Air Force and Marines

975
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:22,480
are part of the Navy so well at the Navy

976
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,850
you know we were the last ones we were

977
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,650
woefully inadequate first thing we did

978
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:29,440
is we went to the other branches and

979
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:31,150
said what did you guys do right what did

980
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,250
you do wrong we want to we want to learn

981
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,740
from you we don't want to make the same

982
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:38,110
mistakes you made and where there's a

983
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,379
great return the low-hanging fruit the

984
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:45,270
quick wins what can I do right now right

985
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:47,410
and so we reached out to our peers I

986
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,520
mean at this conference here alone

987
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,020
there's people in here oh I've already

988
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,350
reached out to hey I got this one

989
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:55,330
challenge you already know that that's

990
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,740
going to take you five minutes to come

991
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,480
up with an answer it's going to take me

992
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,520
a day or a week to understand even the

993
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,540
question right so reach out to the

994
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:07,450
expertise that's out there okay thanks

995
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:11,140
one of the one of the things that I

996
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:13,569
found very helpful during the antivirus

997
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:16,540
incident was I met an individual at

998
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:20,350
besides Las Vegas and that person was

999
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:22,480
able to write me a script that could

1000
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:24,819
detect which computers were still left

1001
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,700
that had the antivirus version running

1002
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:29,680
on them that was affected the second

1003
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:33,520
call that I made was to an individual I

1004
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,558
met at b-sides Berlin who funny enough

1005
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,989
also from West Point

1006
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:43,209
who gave me tactical advice and safety

1007
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:45,549
advice and also how to destroy our data

1008
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:46,689
as we were moving out of that country so

1009
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:49,180
if you don't have the existing

1010
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:50,799
capability make the contacts for the

1011
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:54,640
people from the right of you and to the

1012
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:56,859
left of you and moving forward build

1013
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,328
that capacity as you need it but you're

1014
00:47:56,859 --> 00:48:01,630
not going to have everything from day

1015
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:11,559
one and formant these relationships that

1016
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:15,099
you're going to start today if each of

1017
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:18,609
you had the opportunity to talk to a

1018
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:23,049
c-suite about implementing both I are

1019
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:25,380
planning and I are practice what would

1020
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:27,880
you stop three things you'd emphasize

1021
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:33,959
assuming you only had 15 minutes to do

1022
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:37,599
it so in our practice we we do that and

1023
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:40,049
one thing we stress is their role in

1024
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,969
this process

1025
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:46,749
and what I tell them to to kind of ease

1026
00:48:42,969 --> 00:48:49,989
their anxiety of everything they need to

1027
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:52,299
know and someone taught me this at one

1028
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:57,039
point I don't need you to know the

1029
00:48:52,299 --> 00:49:00,880
answers I need you to know how to ask

1030
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:04,539
the right questions and then how to

1031
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,759
leverage when you say a board member the

1032
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:10,329
reason they're brought in is because of

1033
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:12,670
the strength of their network I need you

1034
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:16,179
how I need you to be able to ask the

1035
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:18,219
right questions and how to leverage your

1036
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:21,099
network for the challenge that we have

1037
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:22,569
at hand right now there's more to it

1038
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:26,949
than that but you said only if I only

1039
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:29,619
had 15 minutes one of the things that

1040
00:49:26,949 --> 00:49:32,469
I've done is there are many different

1041
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:35,019
types of crisis's that a company and

1042
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:38,079
organization can go through and they

1043
00:49:35,019 --> 00:49:40,209
plan ahead already for if there's a fire

1044
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,719
or if there's a crime that is committed

1045
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:46,629
on a property you might have people who

1046
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:47,930
are trained up for basic safety in your

1047
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,830
office

1048
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:56,419
that helped do fire drills for example

1049
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:58,970
so if you need to plan and prepare and

1050
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:02,150
you need an IR plan and you need to test

1051
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:04,640
that out incorporate it into some of the

1052
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:07,610
existing processes so that it doesn't

1053
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,259
seem super super exotic and especially

1054
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:12,260
doesn't make them think that oh gosh

1055
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,550
it's security-related it's just going to

1056
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,640
be a money pit that were throwing it

1057
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:19,190
into so try to incorporate it into the

1058
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,020
existing processes you know that's a

1059
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:23,300
good point if you don't mind my steers

1060
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:26,120
real quick in that crisis response that

1061
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:30,140
an incident response it's a crisis a

1062
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:34,130
crisis as a crisis as a crisis there's a

1063
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:36,560
cyber crisis that can be an appendix to

1064
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:39,550
the bigger crisis there's the fire

1065
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,049
crisis there's other types of things

1066
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:45,440
with the response the whole of

1067
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:48,500
organization is that the common

1068
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,860
denominator there what you're going to

1069
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:54,620
do for a cyber crisis that's part of

1070
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,750
that plan but the board has to be

1071
00:50:54,620 --> 00:51:00,290
involved if they're involved in a crisis

1072
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:03,800
of of a natural disaster then they

1073
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:06,980
should be involved in this - just a

1074
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:09,200
reinforcement it's reminding I'll use

1075
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:12,590
the board the board members that the

1076
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,390
instant response cyber IT is as we think

1077
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,890
about the folks who sit don't sit on

1078
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:19,040
boards currently might have thought of

1079
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:22,359
IT is this thing in the corner fix my

1080
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,860
computer fix my outlook run the database

1081
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:27,050
that is not what it is is a business

1082
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:30,020
function okay so it should be treated as

1083
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:33,020
such and I think by ensuring that they

1084
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,340
take that idea and remind them that it's

1085
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,759
just as important as finance operations

1086
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:40,010
marketing and sales will make more sense

1087
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,330
to them and then thrust in them I'd

1088
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:43,160
recommend it they get thrusted into

1089
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:45,740
their own individual Incident Response

1090
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:48,230
so that it becomes real so that you can

1091
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,819
better ask the appropriate questions so

1092
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,980
they can better coach the executive

1093
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,200
teams on how to deal with this when it

1094
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,300
happens before the government gets

1095
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,549
involved and sources fiduciary

1096
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,370
responsibility for having a cyber expert

1097
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,360
to sit right next to them

1098
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:05,089
[Music]

1099
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:11,460
any other questions

1100
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:13,020
didn't get the tail wag well thank you

1101
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,180
all for coming out here and Chris for

1102
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:19,170
inviting us to the heist a night to join

1103
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:26,259
you on this panel thanks everybody

1104
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:26,260
