1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,210
20:20 stream will begin momentarily the

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:21,689
b-sides Nova 20/20 stream will begin

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:26,970
momentarily the b-sides Nova 20/20

4
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,890
stream will begin momentarily already

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,288
wow that's too loud

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,210
maybe we can don't move that away from

7
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,460
me that's gonna be better okay I'll try

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,500
to speak too loud and drown us out here

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,870
or whatever my name is Jake Williams

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,340
this is cybersecurity merger and

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,809
acquisition due diligence or threat

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,730
hunting for cybersecurity emanated

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,578
diligence whatever we titled the talk

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,648
basically the idea here is are you doing

15
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,239
cybersecurity due diligence for M&A I

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,190
don't know the photo policy is here

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,959
don't really care rock on tweet whatever

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,519
you want photo whatever you want I'll

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
happily publish the slides afterwards

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,989
and you know again just follow malware

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,910
Jake on Twitter if you hit me up on

22
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,188
Twitter I will definitely be posting the

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,830
slides under this or rendition SEC after

24
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:10,439
the fact right so about me all this

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,760
stuff but the cool one here is formally

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,899
endorsed by the shadow brokers you may

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,880
remember them they're the ones that

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,409
started wanna cry and not Pecha by

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,630
dumping a lot of I think I'm still

30
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,320
required to say alleged NSA tools

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,619
anyway I'm alleged NSA hacking tools and

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,809
and then apparently I wrote too much

33
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,159
about them and maybe drew some

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,140
inappropriate Russian intelligence

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,030
conclusions I say inappropriate

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,130
inappropriate or inconvenient for them

37
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,100
because then outed me by name and said

38
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,750
that guy all right they're like let me

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,429
tell you why he's commenting on this

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,979
he's that dude and I was like yeah that

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,079
sucks right anyway so now it's out

42
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,060
former NSA hacker master see any

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,189
operator DoD exceptional civilian

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,869
Service Medal all that good stuff and I

45
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,699
totally dislike people that involve

46
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,649
watching and everything right

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,869
I'm currently fighting a fighting a

48
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,030
debate with a couple of utilities who

49
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,579
want to include and you cannot make this

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,130
up blockchain in their smart meters and

51
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,389
I'm just literally now by the way

52
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,369
they're not calling a blockchain even

53
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,800
where it's DLT anybody familiar this DLT

54
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,810
distributed ledger technology it's a way

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,400
to get blockchain in without calling

56
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,410
blockchain right if you think about

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,360
blockchain is it really is DLT at the

58
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,560
end of the day all right so that's me

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,720
for those that don't already know me

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,000
otherwise an Olympic poster on

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,000
Twitter and that's pretty much pretty

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,220
much my job right so as far as agenda

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,760
why does cybersecurity due diligence

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,269
matter and I just got done teaching up

65
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,069
at Cyber Command for a week and but I've

66
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,190
been Columbia Maryland and now I'm down

67
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,890
here and prior to that though I spent a

68
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,720
couple of weeks that I didn't plan to

69
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,609
spend actually alright in fact if you

70
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,870
follow me on Twitter I actually had

71
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,019
several folks checking in on me and

72
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,880
saying are you okay right and like has

73
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,980
something happened to you or any prior

74
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,200
to RSA I actually spent a couple of

75
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,819
weeks overseas working on one of the

76
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,010
starting so one of our key stone clients

77
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,410
called up and we kind of have the

78
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,899
warning order on it but they're like hey

79
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:09,359
this is this is a big big deal and we

80
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,799
need you to go and we need to go now and

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,209
literally from the time they signed the

82
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,890
contract we had a warning order for

83
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,390
about two weeks that it might be

84
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,238
happening at some point in the future

85
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,708
and then at some point literally they

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,200
sign the contract three hours later I

87
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,700
was on a plane and so literally three

88
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
hours later on a plane overseas by the

89
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,170
way if you want to get strip-searched by

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,200
customs buy a one-way ticket three hours

91
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,630
before you get on a flight to overseas

92
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,179
customs when you land is way not cool

93
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,190
with that right so Thanks so what are

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,810
you here for why are you rolling a

95
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,840
Pelican case in all right it's a whole

96
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,400
like yes same kind of thing and anyway I

97
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,410
have another executive right now doing

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,209
another one of these as we speak also

99
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,769
overseas incidentally I'm now worried

100
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,319
about his ability to return to the US

101
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,060
we'll see how that plays but alas and

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,429
this is the kind of thing that that a

103
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,799
lot of folks are doing and it couldn't

104
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,600
come a moment too soon right I'm not

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,310
gonna call out specific businesses here

106
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,870
that it failed at this majorly right I'm

107
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,079
definitely not gonna say something like

108
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,790
Starwood or Marriott right we're not

109
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,260
gonna discuss those here I know we're

110
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,388
totally gonna discuss those here of

111
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,920
course we are right because Marriott

112
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,720
right as awesome as they are right

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,399
mirror out lifetime like Lifetime

114
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,570
Achievement status with Marriott had

115
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,159
actually have one of my employees come

116
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,358
to me last year he's like dude you're

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,760
not gonna believe this you have me on

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,070
the road so much now over the last four

119
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,599
years like I'm lifetime silver I'm like

120
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,750
I don't know they have lifetime anything

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,010
is right so I go into my account this is

122
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,720
not something you want to do by the way

123
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,340
I went into my account and I found out

124
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,650
that I have stayed now more than

125
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,710
accumulative three years at Marriott

126
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,539
properties frame and so I'm now at their

127
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,969
lifetime whatever the heck that is and

128
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,590
done her and so I was like wow let's

129
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,980
never check that again right and kind of

130
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,900
thing but but alas Marriott dare I say

131
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,240
screwed the pooch right they bought

132
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,830
Starwood and you probably remember this

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,740
from last year was one of the big big

134
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,599
breaches that was announced last year

135
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,880
except it wasn't really so much a breach

136
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,890
as it was a lingering cybersecurity

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,620
issue they were breached when they were

138
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,960
purchased and Starwood was breached when

139
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,480
the deal was going down and so Marriott

140
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,099
literally bought Starwood and in

141
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,840
addition to buying all their properties

142
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,480
and buying their customer lists and

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,630
buying all of that they also bought a

144
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,340
breach and they bought all of the

145
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,200
liability that goes with that everything

146
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,419
that goes with that obviously not you

147
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,360
know not a big deal I say not a big deal

148
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,430
not a big win for them right whoever

149
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,160
chose not to do cyber security to do due

150
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,970
diligence in this case probably was on

151
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,680
the hurtin side of that right so the

152
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,090
Starwood CEO was absolutely lucky yeah

153
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,770
there's there's no question there right

154
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,659
anybody else involved with Starwood

155
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,950
right was lucky because they basically

156
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,020
got purchased that they're at the

157
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,030
premium versus the actual value right

158
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,620
because of course when you bring on and

159
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,789
when you buy a company or buying all

160
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,650
their assets but you're also buying

161
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,810
their liabilities right and if you've

162
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,429
ever done M&A in general you know all

163
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,230
about the whole liabilities versus

164
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,120
assets thing and and certainly again

165
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,160
cybersecurity is becoming a big deal

166
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,530
right that gdpr CCPA

167
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,510
all right not to mention Sox certainly

168
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,520
PCI see a couple of smile and I her like

169
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,250
yes that's my life now I totally I'm

170
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,419
there with you yes yes totally but again

171
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,950
you know we have to deal with these

172
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,750
regulatory issues and the course there's

173
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,710
a lot of fines that come with us so so

174
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,240
why does that matter

175
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,830
we'll talk us some techniques to do this

176
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,660
right this isn't just a fluff like oh my

177
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,550
gosh this guy is falling right I'll

178
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,110
happily walk you through the process by

179
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,090
which we do this and we'll talk about

180
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,360
some M&A challenges right so some

181
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,469
challenges that we face doing this

182
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,150
because it's not the kind of thing where

183
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,000
it's like I do pen testing therefore I

184
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,568
can do M&A or I do GRC therefore I can

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,610
do M&A

186
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,990
it really takes the team right so if I

187
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,330
didn't have a good team back a rendition

188
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,009
I absolutely couldn't do this well I

189
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,050
could fake it right but I couldn't do it

190
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,699
right at the end of the day every due

191
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,559
diligence assessment that we do has a

192
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,169
pen testing component has an it's a

193
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,999
response component and it has a GRC

194
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:59,008
component and so I need a team of people

195
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:01,679
to do this and I will tell you that

196
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:04,529
consistently we run into mop-up work

197
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:06,448
with folks that do 101 of those three

198
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,399
things right or in some cases rare cases

199
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,959
two of those three things you need a

200
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,069
team that's cross-functional to be able

201
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,240
to do all that I'll talk about this

202
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,879
challenge isn't it of course we'll wrap

203
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,169
it up so why does it matter I've already

204
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,029
talked a little bit about this right but

205
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,008
look when an organization's acquired the

206
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,139
assets get transferred unfortunately the

207
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,059
liability or fortunately take your pick

208
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,740
the liability gets transferred with it I

209
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:28,589
will tell you that I'm working with a

210
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,599
company right now as we speak that is

211
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:32,339
going through an acquisition and due to

212
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,748
our due diligence work they know for a

213
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,509
fact the people that they're acquiring

214
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:37,769
were breached and only because of her

215
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,569
due diligence work they know they have a

216
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,039
breach and what they are scrambling to

217
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,189
do right now is getting all the

218
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,990
disclosures done under the old name so

219
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,059
that they can jettison the old name and

220
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,209
as anybody googles later they don't ever

221
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:52,289
see any disclosures under the new name

222
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,969
obviously this is smart right this is

223
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,409
this is a very very smart thing to do

224
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:56,789
because you don't want to have to manage

225
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,469
right the last thing you want to do is

226
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,839
bring on the small picture that you're

227
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:03,689
just this mega company right mega Corp

228
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,939
and I'll use the term small Co and big

229
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:07,769
Co throughout the presentation right big

230
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,809
Co is the acquiring company granted this

231
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,490
is not always the case right but

232
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:14,009
typically big Co is the acquiring

233
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,079
companies small Co is the company being

234
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,269
acquired right the organization being

235
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,189
acquired and so we don't want a scenario

236
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,139
where a big co or this big go doesn't

237
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:24,469
want a scenario where they by this tiny

238
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,729
small Co very often these small Koho

239
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:29,519
acquisitions or we call higher positions

240
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,039
they're not so much interested in the

241
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,959
overall basically the overall entity

242
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,269
they're interesting a very specific set

243
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,159
of people and/or intellectual property

244
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:39,240
in fact there's a third term that you

245
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,029
may hear me use throughout the

246
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,459
presentation called spin Co and spin Co

247
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:46,680
is what's left over from small Co when

248
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,239
they're done pillaging I think is the

249
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,410
word we're going to use here the PC term

250
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,380
that we're going to use when they're

251
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,719
done pillaging small Cove

252
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,699
Spin Co is what's left over and those

253
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,560
are the good luck with that employees by

254
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:59,420
the way if you ever find yourself after

255
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,329
an M&A and they're like yeah and we're

256
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,729
spinning off get out bail bail bail

257
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:06,739
right because whatever is left over big

258
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,660
co looked at and they're like that's the

259
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,279
non profitable part that's the piece

260
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,050
that can't make a profit that's the

261
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,339
piece that we don't want either can't

262
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,250
make a profit has too much liability

263
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:17,990
what have you people smarter than you

264
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,149
well maybe not smarter than you but

265
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,769
people that took way more time than you

266
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,630
could ever possibly put in and have

267
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,370
information that you do not made a

268
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,680
decision that you are not part of the

269
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,019
winning group get out right that is a

270
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,829
clear canary in the coal mine get out

271
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:35,240
right anyway so again no M&A would be

272
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:36,829
complete without investigating physical

273
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,199
assets right or factories in good shape

274
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:40,849
to the massive upgrades etc for some

275
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:42,949
reason we are still running into folks

276
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,110
that do not want to do cybersecurity due

277
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,579
diligence which blows my mind right

278
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,860
because if you start looking at

279
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,870
liability right we seriously if you lose

280
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,420
a customer database today a large scale

281
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,670
again picture Marriott Starwood Marriott

282
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,709
would be better off no joke if one of

283
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,139
the Starwood Hotels literally imploded

284
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,089
right killing a couple dozen or even a

285
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,889
hundred guests than they were with the

286
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,630
breach right when it comes down to it

287
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:07,639
the actual impact of that you know that

288
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,500
had again everybody does the whole

289
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,420
physical security side like again are

290
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,130
the buildings in good shape right where

291
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,930
are we at here what are our liabilities

292
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,120
around that cyber security for whatever

293
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,469
reason seems to fall by the wayside I

294
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,569
see a pattern kind of hitting up here

295
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,569
I'll mention here too that every M&A has

296
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:25,339
at least well in the last two decades

297
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,930
has involved heterogeneous technologies

298
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,850
which actor directory reversion or you

299
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,680
want what Linux builds right it's one

300
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,050
thing to be like I have Linux and you're

301
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,060
talking RedHat Ubuntu right and granted

302
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,699
it's very easy to be like Oh Linux is

303
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,439
Linux and it is right but but let's be

304
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,300
fair right you need people that

305
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,800
understand that at the system admin side

306
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,149
of course very often everyone is

307
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,310
planning like yeah we'll just we'll just

308
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:48,560
fold over the IT shop we we don't need

309
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,599
that other Linux admin as Joe over here

310
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,250
you can handle that right and of course

311
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,410
Joe's a Red Hat engineer right who's

312
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,149
never seen can't can't even spell Ubuntu

313
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,519
right and then he's like you know his

314
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,439
back to like holo has ubuntu debian he's

315
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,120
like I don't know kind of thing you

316
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,390
don't want that dude right admitting

317
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,830
your

318
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,780
at Minear Network you just know right

319
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,360
actor directory versions are either

320
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,800
going to functional level 2008-2012

321
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,600
well what is your domain functional

322
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,550
level because that matters for a

323
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,780
security perspective the folks in the

324
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,180
room here if you're a blue team right

325
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,839
folks are blue teamers how folks are red

326
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:23,810
teamers how many folks are GRC sorry

327
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,760
anyway so yeah I mean look I appreciate

328
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,670
all of our GRC folks we need them I just

329
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,840
want to be that person but Thea I'm much

330
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,699
more comfortable in the keyboard and

331
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,840
rock on but it requires all of us here

332
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,100
alright and so if you're a blue team or

333
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,830
you undoubtedly and probably the red

334
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,960
teamers to you know understand at a very

335
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,060
very deep level how these security

336
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,610
mitigations that we have available are

337
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,349
entirely dependent on I say entirely

338
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,330
largely dependent on the functional

339
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,710
level of our domains and so it's one

340
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,840
thing to be like hey we're gonna merge

341
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,070
you know we're gonna merge these domains

342
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,230
no problem

343
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,120
but but of course the reality is anytime

344
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,740
something's like just upgrade the

345
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,900
functional level listen I have a theory

346
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,940
about the word just when somebody uses

347
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,880
the word just in the context of

348
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,440
cybersecurity I just shut down and I

349
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,390
just use the word just I understand that

350
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,920
I shut down and the reason is they

351
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,840
fundamentally do not understand the

352
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,199
complexity of the problem if the problem

353
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,360
space was solvable with a just action

354
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,710
that then it would already solved I mean

355
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,280
that's that's the reality of things

356
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,040
right

357
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,510
do we have legacy unix versions I will

358
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,480
share a story here before we're all done

359
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:31,300
where I kid you not last year I found

360
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,520
VMs forget UNIX VMs in production right

361
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,589
to the point that multiple different

362
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,850
analysts looked at and by the way how

363
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,700
many folks actually have ever been a

364
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,140
sysadmin on VMs yeah and you see now

365
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,020
look around because that's like four

366
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,780
hands in the audience right and so VMs

367
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,970
is so old that multiple different

368
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,829
analysts looked at it and I said oh hey

369
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,670
you accidentally capitalized the s and

370
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:58,310
they took it to mean VMs VMs plural

371
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:02,240
right and I had to continuously clarify

372
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:05,150
no I mean VMs from the DEF days and

373
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,400
they're like Dec Dec what and I'm like

374
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,949
def alpha right in there you mean before

375
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,140
beta I'm like no I'm gonna throw you out

376
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,440
a window no

377
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,930
all right like I mean that old right

378
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,570
like before Intel there was spark and

379
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,399
before spark there was Dec where more

380
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,440
accurately there was alpha right and so

381
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,410
I mean wow we're talking about in

382
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,089
production right and so this is and by

383
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,310
the way not just in production but

384
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,200
literally running production meaning the

385
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,599
company ceases to exist without these

386
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,470
three servers right well now two servers

387
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,079
but we'll talk about that in a minute

388
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,250
anyway so VPN a Roman access

389
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,500
technologies what do those look like

390
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,450
right and of course we now have a

391
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,579
critical O'Day in point-to-point

392
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,410
point-to-point protocol daemon anybody

393
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:49,120
following this you totally should be

394
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,529
alright that broke this week I know

395
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,540
that's fairly new and there's not an

396
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:55,390
active proof of concept to go exploit

397
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,550
but let me tell you a friendiy a the

398
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,680
exploitation is trivial and we'll just

399
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,779
leave that there and expect to see

400
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,719
another another Citrix kind of revamp

401
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,800
thing going here so look we understand

402
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,300
why this is a big deal let's talk about

403
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,500
techniques right because I presume most

404
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,540
of the folks in here about the Red Team

405
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,700
Blue Team hands or practitioners how do

406
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,410
we do this right look obviously

407
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,930
traditional truck hunting relies on iOS

408
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,160
ES and baseline deviations I have bad

409
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,599
news for you here right

410
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,219
if you've ever done threat hunting you

411
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,420
know you have to build up a baseline of

412
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,250
what the network looks like and that's

413
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,050
awesome and it doesn't work in M&A due

414
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,220
diligence because if you walk in you're

415
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,510
like what's your baseline and they're

416
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:33,220
like my baseline let's see good might

417
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,510
that's not a baseline I need to know

418
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,579
what does normal look like in your

419
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,959
network and they're like we've never had

420
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,089
a vulnerability scan and I'm like

421
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,729
alrighty then alright so you don't have

422
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,959
time to build up your baselines

423
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,820
certainly we can use iOS ease right

424
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:49,170
unfortunately this requires things like

425
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,490
EDR right endpoint detection response

426
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,890
more bad news for you we usually don't

427
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,690
have EDR software stood up in our

428
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,100
organization even Sam all right our

429
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,930
security information event management

430
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,970
system or seam if you're out on the west

431
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,829
coast we notice that by the way folks

432
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,779
here tend to say some folks on the west

433
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:06,399
coast and tend to say seem I don't

434
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,110
actually care but whatever security

435
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,930
information event management systems I'm

436
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,850
lucky to even have one of those baseline

437
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,709
baseline it takes time it's uneasy right

438
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,260
if you've ever tried to deploy you be a

439
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:19,660
your you EBA right a user environment

440
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,399
behavioral analytics you know how hard

441
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,750
it is to get a baseline it's not

442
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,209
something that we can do automatically

443
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,879
and we

444
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:27,469
know this right and so this is a problem

445
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,059
that I run into here I mean how do I

446
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,779
even build that baseline in the first

447
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:31,670
place right

448
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:33,230
if baselines were trivial obvious this

449
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,110
would be a different conversation now I

450
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,910
was just at RSA two weeks ago and I was

451
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,529
assured by a multitude of vendors that

452
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,019
with machine learning and artificial

453
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:44,059
intelligence baselines are trivial and I

454
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,529
can use them from a next M&A assessment

455
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:48,800
and I'll have no problems they've

456
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:50,209
literally programmed me out of a job and

457
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,040
I almost didn't come here to give this

458
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:54,138
talk based on that alone I was like you

459
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,059
know what just by vendor X's software

460
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:58,819
vendor Y Z or whatever the heck they are

461
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:00,949
because of course of course they've got

462
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:03,559
the problem solved right of course they

463
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:06,459
don't train ridiculous mi al that's our

464
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:10,459
a landline machine learning ml and AI

465
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:12,800
transposition there anyway so M&A again

466
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:14,809
most most networks that we hunt in again

467
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,569
they just lack baselines they lack

468
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:19,519
systems like EDR systems for hunting IOC

469
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:21,349
s obviously scanning systems are not

470
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,119
trivial to deploy that's a problem in

471
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,660
and of itself right so even if I said

472
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:28,279
hey I can license on-demand EDR let's

473
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,139
say McAfee is like a shor Jake you just

474
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,049
there's a ploy wherever you want cuz

475
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,579
we're we're cool like that right even if

476
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:36,049
I could do that even if I didn't have to

477
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,969
worry about the long term licensing

478
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:39,920
issues go ahead and roll into a system

479
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,779
admin and be like hey I want you to go

480
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,009
and push out this new agent across every

481
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,319
one of your workstations and servers

482
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:47,209
right go ahead and do that and they're

483
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,949
like not no no all right they're just

484
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:51,079
like no you're absolutely not doing that

485
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:52,758
this is obviously problematic as well by

486
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,378
the way to a big rub and I haven't

487
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,699
talked about this yet but you should

488
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,100
know that when you're doing these merger

489
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,899
and acquisition due diligence most folks

490
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,509
that you're interacting with at small Co

491
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,649
do not know they're being acquired so

492
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:05,569
you have a whole separate issue of

493
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,339
stealth there right so you're in there

494
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,289
trying to like beat a deadline because

495
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:10,849
there's always a date on the map right

496
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:12,980
trying to generate this report and

497
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,510
trying to basically communicate that

498
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,699
there's an urgency here without

499
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,898
communicating urgency and I'm like hey

500
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,360
I've got time to do this

501
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:22,250
cybersecurity assessments right but and

502
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,198
they're like well why is this such a

503
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,579
rush and you're like because you'll be

504
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,260
out of a job in a month because you're

505
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,760
bad at this kind of thing but anyway

506
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,770
neither here nor there right so you have

507
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,220
to play that you know kind of play that

508
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:36,168
play that little covert train as it were

509
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,540
right so again most these are pre

510
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,440
purchased invest

511
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,720
nobody's interested in undertaking a

512
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,520
huge cybersecurity project just to

513
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,960
determine the valuation and and again

514
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,760
what we're doing here is trying to

515
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,030
communicate risk that does directly

516
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,120
impact valuation so the best IOC is an

517
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,980
industry these are vertical specific in

518
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,239
some cases these threat hunts and you

519
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,370
know the vertical specific thing if

520
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,140
you're tied into an I sack or a nice al

521
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,540
you already know there's a reason those

522
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,860
were vertical specific obviously when it

523
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,860
comes to holding companies these get

524
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:09,020
super super crazy right so look if if

525
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,030
I'm working with a financial services

526
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,470
firm right they're probably already big

527
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,820
codes the financial services firm

528
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,250
they're buying another financial

529
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,470
services firm good news we have all the

530
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,270
IOC s we need through the FSI sack right

531
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,400
when we have a holding company on the

532
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,410
other hand they are tied up in lots and

533
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,270
lots of stuff I don't have super bad

534
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,830
news for you a lot of the M&A s that are

535
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,470
done are done by holding companies right

536
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,570
so now I'm acquiring a company or small

537
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:36,560
Co is any different vertical than big Co

538
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,970
is and anyway so this is this is a spot

539
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,100
where we have to have a plan in place

540
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,040
for finding verticals specific CTI

541
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,310
information good news the best place

542
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,260
that I get that is is here and it's here

543
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,720
at conferences when I network with all

544
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,450
the people around right shake hands kiss

545
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,430
babies exchange business cards all that

546
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,020
stuff so that I can phone a friend right

547
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,580
now at the end of the day if I didn't

548
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,110
have something specific right I know

549
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,860
somebody that works in that industry

550
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,020
right

551
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,459
obviously that's that's easier once you

552
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,389
build a big social media fall and we're

553
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,950
gonna tweet and be like do I know

554
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,960
someone in health care and they can be

555
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,150
like you know 50 people answer that's

556
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,300
super easy if that's not you though

557
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:17,420
seriously one DM me my DMS are open all

558
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,010
tweeted for you to separately network

559
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,810
with the people here right network with

560
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,850
people around talk to people at

561
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,280
conferences one you land your next job

562
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,360
that way and to in a better job for that

563
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,710
matter I mean not that anybody here's

564
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,149
looking I'm sure or not because your

565
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,820
employer is like all about you being

566
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,220
here but but anyway certainly again

567
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,200
networking for the win right so what

568
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,820
about tooling you cannot count on

569
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,590
organizations having their own tooling

570
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,210
if you are planning on the org having

571
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:44,060
their own tooling you have already lost

572
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,130
right all the things that we count on

573
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,720
for threat hunting all right so again in

574
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,700
a normal threat hunt I have an IDI are

575
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,180
our endpoint detection response I

576
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,800
absolutely have a say

577
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,180
and I have all the logging configured

578
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,040
appropriately and I have network

579
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,230
security monitoring hopefully with TLS

580
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,060
interception I've got all that stuff

581
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,390
going that's a minimum to start doing

582
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,820
good solid threat hunting right I don't

583
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,710
have that here I have lots of problems

584
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,810
here doing that right because I don't

585
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,210
have a SEM anybody hurt deploy to SEM

586
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:14,669
like from from start to finish would you

587
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,920
describe it as a religious what's it

588
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,050
well I said finish there we go ISO so

589
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,520
there we go right I was gonna ask would

590
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,240
you describe it as a religious

591
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,520
experience one two Christmases there we

592
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,400
go right so so yes I mean that seriously

593
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,680
is and everybody done this has horror

594
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,180
stories like this I usually tell people

595
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,230
it's funny cuz you know I work with ions

596
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,390
they're the Institute for applied

597
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,220
network security you know I'll do a lot

598
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,620
of work with with clients for they're

599
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,970
like hey I'm trying to decide on a sim

600
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,469
and they want to have like an hour phone

601
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,640
call like and they're like at the end of

602
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,470
the phone call we're just gonna they're

603
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,690
gonna pick us em and I'm like stop that

604
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,250
madness right like I will happily

605
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,650
consult with you for an hour or longer

606
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,850
if you need it but but don't think after

607
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,230
the end of an hour phone call you're

608
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,179
gonna go pick a sim I tell people

609
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,350
regularly you can get out of a marriage

610
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,170
quicker than you get out of a semi

611
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,879
alright and if you doubt me let's then

612
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,320
look I know that's a reverent but look

613
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,430
the majority of marriages you can get

614
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,990
out of quicker than you can change out

615
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,790
stems and that's all I'm saying

616
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,380
right people don't go in with the same

617
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,879
amount of due diligence I would say and

618
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,920
picking that kind of stuff the bottom

619
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,720
line here is I can't simply go drop

620
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,300
stuff in even if I have all the IT

621
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,670
available most of my tooling doesn't

622
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,169
have flexible licensing plans right so I

623
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,910
can't simply call up and I'm not gonna

624
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,560
name some vendors here all right but I

625
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,510
can't simply call up the majority of my

626
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,690
vendors and be like hey I wanted to play

627
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,830
the sim but only for this week I mean

628
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,900
seriously they're not they're not

629
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,600
programmed that way alright I can't call

630
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,070
it Mac if you like I love your EDR we

631
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,679
wanted to employ it for two weeks across

632
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,750
50,000 nodes or 10,000 nodes or whatever

633
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,010
Mac we just look something like you got

634
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,300
to be kidding and that's semantics one

635
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,160
and pick up the phone right because they

636
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,600
got acquired by Broadcom and all and if

637
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,510
we're not moving off of semantics go now

638
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,340
right anyway moving forward and right so

639
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,860
getting buy-in for agent based products

640
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,820
this is super problematic as well so

641
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,370
what are some of the techniques that we

642
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,990
use right so we do a couple of things

643
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,610
here we've got a lot of we got a big

644
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,540
checklist for all the documentation we

645
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,669
request up front

646
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,470
wanna go review security practices right

647
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,450
we want to go look at vulnerability

648
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,640
scanning network network traffic capture

649
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,650
an IDs recall by the way most

650
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,360
organizations do not have this already

651
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,580
all right begin small codes we're

652
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,139
talking about generally ten thousand and

653
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,510
less nodes on the network because

654
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,640
generally we do M&A for although we've

655
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,050
done a little bit there the final big

656
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,580
one here though I will talk about the

657
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,800
threat hunting thing the big one that we

658
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,659
deal with here is this one Ram

659
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,490
evaluation of residual risk from

660
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,530
previous breaches there are a lot of

661
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,870
really bad and responders out there and

662
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,940
by bad I mean criminally bad incident

663
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:41,040
responders out there I'm involved as an

664
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,320
expert witness in lawsuits against -

665
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,050
right now soon to be a third I suspect

666
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,879
where they have done criminally bad

667
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,159
Incident Response organizations have

668
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,930
acted on that they think and it's the

669
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,330
worst possible scenario because they

670
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,380
think they did everything right and then

671
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,909
you go in there and they're like I have

672
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,090
really really bad news for you that

673
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:01,710
thing you paid a lot of money for they

674
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,050
steered you really really really wrong

675
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,960
right and now we need to fix this before

676
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,520
big Co acquires you right or at least in

677
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,100
tune with big Co acquiring you and

678
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,560
you're looking out massive devaluations

679
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,409
as a result because value rain is really

680
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,510
assets - risk right assets - -

681
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,860
liabilities is we're values at so if you

682
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,320
have increased liabilities because of

683
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,750
bad previous breaches or breaches that

684
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,909
were previously handled poorly again

685
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,140
this is this is just absolutely huge

686
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,120
so we'll investigate one of these in

687
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,680
more detail talking about security

688
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,600
practices so I'm going to start here

689
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,490
do you have segmentation that this is

690
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,040
basic blue team stuff right do you have

691
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,420
network segmentation that's number one

692
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,830
what are our group memberships and actor

693
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,750
directory now a lot of people are like

694
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,370
why are you looking at group memberships

695
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,540
right I will tell you the number one

696
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,550
thing I'm looking for and a lot of

697
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,440
people like too many domain admins I'm

698
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,360
like nope no that's that's easy that's

699
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,120
romper room level stuff rights and

700
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,250
security 401 is like take people out of

701
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,620
Active Directory domain admin groups and

702
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,450
right any idiot can see eh can do a

703
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,120
training kind of thing right and so

704
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,320
anyway right I probably now burn

705
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,179
somebody in this room where they're

706
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,730
gonna like key my car on the way out I

707
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,940
see oh my gosh I can't believe you said

708
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,730
that

709
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,890
welcome to yes anyway it only gets

710
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,170
better for me or my friend anyway um so

711
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,130
the thing we're looking for here is

712
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,010
nested groups

713
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:23,010
nested groups are the devil and if you

714
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:25,230
talk to any Active Directory admin they

715
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,990
will tell you this frame I can tell you

716
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:31,800
that nested groups are absolutely a

717
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:34,080
thousand percent evidence of technical

718
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,149
debt right and it's either technical

719
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,580
debt in that the admin who did it didn't

720
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,830
understand what they were doing or they

721
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,870
said eff it make it work and they kick

722
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,720
the can down the road right we all know

723
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,689
any CISSP in the room knows that

724
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,650
security is built out of three things

725
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,110
confidentiality integrity and

726
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,910
availability right and again I'm not

727
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,250
gonna do size SSP prep here it's not

728
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,810
gonna be all CISSP review but but a lot

729
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,970
of admins are focused on one thing and

730
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,220
one thing only its availability does it

731
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,190
work make it go right and I've heard

732
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,480
I've heard it repeatedly in fact in fact

733
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,280
confession time all right as a business

734
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,410
owner I've said it I said just make it

735
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,670
go I just make it go we'll worry about

736
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,100
the confidentiality in a minute just

737
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:16,110
make it go now right and and every time

738
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,110
I regret it every time I feel a little

739
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,879
ill all right but look nested groups

740
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,889
absolutely the devil right and again I

741
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
don't have to step back and say hey I've

742
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,920
got lots of problems you know when I say

743
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,180
nested groups by the way folks that

744
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,190
don't track what I'm talking about here

745
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,200
that means you're layering groups inside

746
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,600
of groups inside of groups right this

747
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,070
makes it super super difficult to

748
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,929
determine we call our stop or the

749
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,639
resultant set of permissions right and

750
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,800
so our SOP result in set of permissions

751
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,690
it makes it very very difficult to do

752
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,580
and people screw it up and this over

753
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,840
provisions users all the time and I

754
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,790
don't want to talk about Rob was his

755
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,949
name reined in fogged in

756
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,540
Snowden don't want to talk about any of

757
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,130
that right but you know you have folks

758
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,470
like that or real winners like reality

759
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,110
who happen to have access maybe the data

760
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,550
that they shouldn't and again a lot of

761
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,510
this ends up through message groups I'm

762
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,669
not saying that's what happened in

763
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,190
either of those cases but it certainly

764
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,620
could have right so and we work a lot of

765
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,050
breaches that are the result of

766
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,159
basically over-provisioning groups

767
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,210
antivirus and security tools are and

768
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,130
this again is another measure of

769
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,710
technical debt I know we're all like oh

770
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,390
ah antivirus Oh got it

771
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,460
totally right but but I'm interested to

772
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,860
know if you bought McAfee or you bought

773
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,470
Symantec what do you have turned on did

774
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,659
you literally say GPO push install

775
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,860
antivirus then you check the Box flew

776
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,480
the mission accomplished banner on the

777
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,909
aircraft carrier and said

778
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,679
we are good all right that is not good

779
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,570
we know in most cases that you've

780
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,790
licensed a bunch of other features that

781
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,260
you could be using and we're looking for

782
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,450
how many of those features have you

783
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,980
actually used right again I know how

784
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,330
hard it is to deploy whitelisting I'm

785
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,400
not an idiot I've been there done that

786
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,168
got the t-shirt right I'm interested to

787
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,730
know have you tried are you doing

788
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:52,230
anything around that all right this

789
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,030
gives me again what we're looking for

790
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,380
here because when you walk in and you're

791
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,799
like hey show me where the bodies are

792
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,510
buried

793
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,520
nobody's like hey here's a skull in this

794
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,500
closet right but I'm looking for the

795
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,210
observables that I can use to figure out

796
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,970
where the skeletons are at that's really

797
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,590
the goal frame if there's a salmon if

798
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,540
it's there how our logs monitoring

799
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,209
alright and what logs are being fed into

800
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,299
the sim could you not how I was working

801
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:18,240
with last year I was working with a

802
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:20,040
large bank right who has lots of

803
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,679
regulatory requirements that they

804
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,600
thought they were meeting by and hand to

805
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,490
heaven I'm not making this up by

806
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,750
forwarding their domain controller logs

807
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:32,880
to an off-site sim with seven days of

808
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,010
retention and they said well don't worry

809
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,840
they do analytics and I'm like neat how

810
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,720
far back when you're like seven days and

811
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,159
the guy was like seven days like he was

812
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,590
like I was supposed to be impressed and

813
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,020
I was horrified I'm like you said while

814
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:49,320
we're the rest of logs he's like we have

815
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,970
seven days of retention and then you

816
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,860
have to step back and realize that this

817
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,480
was this was an improvement for them

818
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,820
because they had had an earlier incident

819
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,679
they couldn't review because on the

820
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,290
domain controllers themselves don't fall

821
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,990
out airchair they had seven hours of

822
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,639
retention right which is better than my

823
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,440
favorite or tension of all time and it's

824
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,470
a response we worked where we had 18

825
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,870
minutes of log retention so literally

826
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,640
like the logs roll off there what did

827
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:18,389
you find the logs am I a bad news for

828
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,370
you alright literally like the logs from

829
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,620
when I've checked in and got my visitor

830
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,899
badge have already rolled off I can't

831
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,428
tell you anything about the incident for

832
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,870
good about that we're just on this and I

833
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,179
are Nadia not an MA

834
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,549
I also like to go ask administrators

835
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:34,559
about technical debt right I'll tell you

836
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:36,809
that if you've never taken interviewing

837
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,040
class like how to interview interrogate

838
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,389
I don't wanna use the word interrogate

839
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
because that sounds so negative right

840
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,260
but interviewing certainly is a great

841
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,610
skill

842
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,590
I will tell you that one of the best

843
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,389
avid skimmer to ask how many folks have

844
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,850
taken a polygraph right but if you have

845
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,890
and we're up here I know a lot of folks

846
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:54,260
have I certainly have taken more than my

847
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:56,810
fair share of them because because but

848
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,820
alas you know the polygrapher technique

849
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,280
and if you don't you will now it's ask a

850
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,840
question and shut up it's like what I

851
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,110
asked the question and then does the

852
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,110
answer lie

853
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:12,460
oh well you know there was that I'm like

854
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,020
game on let's do it right people don't

855
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,910
like silence it makes me feel super

856
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:19,810
uncomfortable alright especially you

857
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:21,490
look super judgy mm-hmm mm-hmm and I

858
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,899
also like to check notes I'm anything on

859
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,470
my notes doesn't matter right now I'm

860
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,120
checking my notes am i hmm well you know

861
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,070
there was the one time where that it's

862
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,479
amazing how much stuff you get out of

863
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,800
that writing so I always like to go on

864
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,380
site for these we do some of them

865
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,240
remotely it's very very rare and I like

866
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,710
to go on site specifically because when

867
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,050
I go in and start talking administrators

868
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,910
they give me all kinds administrators

869
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:46,180
give me all kinds of information about

870
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,250
these incidents that didn't really rise

871
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,870
the level incidents they didn't get put

872
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,390
on the disclosure forms for the MLA and

873
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,979
just amazing right so like in one case

874
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,960
last year found out about a ransomware

875
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,150
attack that took down their network for

876
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,740
two days that somehow everybody forgot

877
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:03,700
to put on the disclosure forms right

878
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,440
simply by shutting up and just waited

879
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,150
and the guys like oh you know there was

880
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,120
that one ransomware attack I might tell

881
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:12,430
me more okay and sure enough again lots

882
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,409
of a residual risk there and legacy

883
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,690
systems document why these exist right

884
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,550
look we know security agents don't run

885
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,530
on legacy systems I'm not gonna talk

886
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,899
about anybody CrowdStrike but that has a

887
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,550
you know ADR product that only runs on

888
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,320
Windows 7 and later right that's not a

889
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,300
knock by the way on CrowdStrike it's

890
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,770
just a reality of when folks tell me

891
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,629
like oh I don't worry we got Falcon

892
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,970
deployed I'm like across all your modern

893
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,590
infrastructure Windows 7 and later right

894
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,930
tell me about your stuff before that

895
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,550
because here's the here's the brilliant

896
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,620
convenient truth right the stuff that's

897
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,540
the most vulnerable right those Server

898
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,879
2003 systems you've got floating around

899
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,680
there can't even run the EDR so I have

900
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,750
my worst visibility and my worst

901
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,160
response options in the very place that

902
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,230
I mean them the most all right so I'm

903
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,110
always about technical debt right what

904
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,870
are my audible Linux distros hbox AIX go

905
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:00,669
right and we deal with schoo

906
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,409
right and so yeah absolutely all right

907
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,750
network traffic capture this is a big

908
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,520
one to do we have east-west do we have

909
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,830
north-south do we have full coverage

910
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,620
across our business-to-business VPNs

911
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,879
typically we do not by the way make sure

912
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,800
that your taps are really getting full

913
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,320
duplex traffic I cannot tell you how

914
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,789
often we roll in some place not yeah we

915
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,289
def

916
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:20,940
a network tap in place I mean they're

917
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:23,330
like we ask how much are you know if the

918
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,399
IDS are not a lot it's pretty uh pretty

919
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:28,499
quiet here and immediately I'm like if

920
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,340
your IDs is pretty quiet either you are

921
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:33,899
awesome at tuning IDS's or or

922
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,279
something's broken and very often the

923
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,529
thing that's broken it ends up being

924
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,700
that the tap is half duplex and so

925
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,190
they're literally getting either the

926
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,229
send or the receive traffic but not both

927
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,539
and if you go look at IDs rules a lot of

928
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:47,399
them depend on flow alright a lot of

929
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:49,080
your snort rules right or whatever it is

930
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:51,119
you choose to use right should be snort

931
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,849
or Cercado that runs on the snort rules

932
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,609
but basically a lot of those are set

933
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:58,499
where you require flow which means you

934
00:31:56,609 --> 00:32:00,449
need full-duplex aren't to effectively

935
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:03,570
basically to effectively understand the

936
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,669
direction of traffic right so as we get

937
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,439
into IDs again this is huge for

938
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:09,389
unmanaged and unmanaged endpoints

939
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,999
because what I'm looking for here is

940
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:14,369
shadow IT iron shadow IT and services

941
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:17,099
that were previously or not previously

942
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:19,080
declared by IT business-to-business VPNs

943
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:21,269
these are a huge source of risk for

944
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,859
organizations cannot tell you how often

945
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:25,320
we find interesting stuff on

946
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:28,408
business-to-business VPNs right did a

947
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,970
big incident response well actually not

948
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:31,919
one big instant response but three big

949
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,259
incident responses and about four years

950
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,289
ago and with the hospital a large

951
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:39,570
hospital chain in the Midwest and every

952
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:41,009
time we the third one we got in and

953
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,918
realized this is the third consecutive

954
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,629
time that these apt these Chinese apt

955
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,779
attackers have come in through this one

956
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:50,908
podunk hospital in the middle of nowhere

957
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:52,830
little tiny footprint of something and

958
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:55,979
my first question back but really the

959
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:58,289
first one was the why there you have

960
00:32:55,979 --> 00:33:00,479
like a very small number of employees

961
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:02,639
like no IT infrastructure there why

962
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,769
there why are they coming why is that

963
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:07,019
our zero patient and number two I'm like

964
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:09,599
guys come on we clearly need to go visit

965
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,279
today everything is configured just like

966
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,168
that number three I'm like effort we're

967
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,570
getting the car done four and a half

968
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:16,679
hour road trip later I mean we pull up

969
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,509
there and we found out that there was

970
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,879
some shadow IT that abridged a couple of

971
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:22,769
networks helpfully for us right and they

972
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:24,809
had zero visibility the attacker knows

973
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:26,279
something you don't write that that's

974
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:29,129
just the reality of it you know as

975
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,740
designed they know as built right and so

976
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:32,659
b2b VPNs Hugh

977
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,820
huge huge right I mean again that's

978
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,610
exactly what what got what got cut over

979
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,649
here was a b2b VPN that was bridged over

980
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,020
to his secondary network in case you're

981
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,950
not familiar a lot of hospitals

982
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,470
basically the doctors do not work for

983
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,420
the hospital the nurses do rent the

984
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,400
other texts do but the DA the doctors

985
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,550
not and in many cases they have their

986
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,020
own IT infrastructure and that's exactly

987
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,030
what was happening here and they had

988
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,710
bridged the doctor network to the

989
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,480
regular healthcare network without any

990
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,580
actual monitoring and the attackers

991
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,290
obviously figure this out

992
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,629
and we're able to go exfiltrate data

993
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,800
completely on monitor right and I'd love

994
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,929
to tell you the doctors were doing a

995
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,179
great job of monitoring their network

996
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,440
because of course they are doctors they

997
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,869
have eight years of med school they are

998
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,200
clearly smarter than you are right but

999
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:20,060
but alas no no they were not right so I

1000
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,439
will tell you that on average right

1001
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,449
we've actually run the numbers on this

1002
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,280
right most customers that we work with

1003
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,750
and it's it's a rare customer that can

1004
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,450
account for all their business business

1005
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,610
VPNs they are missing at least 25% of

1006
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,290
them let that sink in for a second right

1007
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,210
because we're talking about folks these

1008
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,429
are big companies that have in on the

1009
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,470
order of 50 plus business-to-business

1010
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:42,350
VPNs I mean we start talking were 25%

1011
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:44,689
we're talking 15 Plus that they don't

1012
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,429
know about right and again if you don't

1013
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,929
know you have a wide open network

1014
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:50,480
connection someplace this turns out

1015
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:53,389
horribly the best case study on this is

1016
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,879
mere sck right well not Pecha in general

1017
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,470
but maersk very specifically right they

1018
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:59,990
had network connections they did not

1019
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,819
know about right not Pecha really showed

1020
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,799
us the size of the shadow Internet with

1021
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,420
these business-to-business VPNs you have

1022
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,730
to go find out where these are at what

1023
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,600
filtering is on them etcetera

1024
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,460
vulnerability scanning I'm not gonna

1025
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,200
belabor this too much other than to say

1026
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,510
you should do a vulnerability scan I

1027
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,368
don't care who comes back and I don't

1028
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,930
worry we do our own vultan scans like

1029
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:20,630
neat cool story bro

1030
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,220
anyway and then we're gonna drop necess

1031
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,740
in anyway and run a vulnerability scan

1032
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,180
of our own right so obvious does require

1033
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,919
some negotiation with the customer I

1034
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,020
don't want a brick equipment I don't

1035
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,720
want to take down ICS stuff if there's

1036
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:36,020
dust oral systems it's stupid complex

1037
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,609
but alas you know certainly we're going

1038
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,490
to work our own workaround

1039
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,750
vulnerability scans there we have a term

1040
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,310
we call triple threat hunting /

1041
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,480
rendition alright so basically we

1042
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,759
started looking at threat hunting and

1043
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,560
how can we do this most effectively

1044
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,300
right because while I would love to go

1045
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,799
dump memory I'm a big memory forensics

1046
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,400
guy while I want to go dump memory from

1047
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,170
every box

1048
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,420
I know it's impractical I can't do that

1049
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,650
scale wise it just doesn't scale so I

1050
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,410
don't work here alright well we'll look

1051
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,820
for is basically start as far as

1052
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,830
starting with fret hunting we're gonna

1053
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,780
go start on the network right so I use

1054
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:07,910
network threat hunting to really start

1055
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,130
vectoring in to where I wanted to end

1056
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:12,109
point data collection and analysis and

1057
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,520
then we use that to vector into where

1058
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,230
are we going to Google memory dumps

1059
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,600
right so it's it's it's the pyramid as

1060
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,160
it were right now that said there are

1061
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,750
some stuff that we go get endpoint data

1062
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,129
and some stuff we've a memory forensics

1063
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,620
from that we don't have signs from the

1064
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,570
network right it's it's usually stuff

1065
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,220
that we get from vulnerability scans if

1066
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,260
I turn around and I find out and this is

1067
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,910
not a hypothetical if I find out that

1068
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,490
you have servers exposed to the internet

1069
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:36,319
that we're running a basically an admin

1070
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:38,419
platform that was developed more than 12

1071
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,670
years ago did you haven't patched trying

1072
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,270
on a random high port that's exposed to

1073
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,400
the Internet

1074
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,810
right I totally am doing threat hunting

1075
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,220
on that regardless of what we have in

1076
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,509
the network monitoring side right we're

1077
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,250
getting a memory dump from that bad boy

1078
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,140
and we're gonna go through and figure

1079
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,490
out what what what else is on that

1080
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,310
normally by the way the answer is

1081
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,770
attackers right but anyway in my

1082
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:00,320
experience at least right so but again

1083
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,910
here we're using vulnerability scanning

1084
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,530
in some cases to inform our threat

1085
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,870
hunting otherwise we're starting with

1086
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,370
our own network taps right so again we

1087
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,390
have some memory resident threats that

1088
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,670
may escape detection

1089
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,140
without good target of memory forensics

1090
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:16,160
if you're not familiar with Duke you to

1091
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:18,049
the uqu Dooku 2.0 was completely

1092
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,240
memory-based completely memory resident

1093
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,190
it exploited boxes every time a box were

1094
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,229
booted it would react sploit the box and

1095
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,000
sit only in memory this obvious is a

1096
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,950
nightmare scenario it's not the common

1097
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,840
thing for malware actually as I say that

1098
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,180
how would you know right and how would I

1099
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,830
know for that matter but again we lack

1100
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,649
visibility to say whether or not it's

1101
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,880
the most common thing out there so again

1102
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,080
we're going to begin our threat hunting

1103
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,140
on the network and then build up the

1104
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,700
stack right so once we find stuff that

1105
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,069
looks weird from a network monitoring

1106
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,540
standpoint then we're gonna pop into

1107
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,060
endpoint data collection and analysis

1108
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,770
some very small number of nodes this is

1109
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,529
a spot where we've written our own EDR

1110
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,210
software because I as that stated

1111
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,790
earlier I can't call McAfee or attain

1112
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,170
iam or whoever and be a me some EDR

1113
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,060
here alright kind of thing because I'm

1114
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,310
only using it for a week two weeks maybe

1115
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,600
a month at the outside all right and so

1116
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,880
we've had to write our own to kind of

1117
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,220
bring in and use there as well right so

1118
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,050
basically we look at asset risk as well

1119
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,330
as indexes suspicion right so sometimes

1120
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,760
the suspicion comes to network sometimes

1121
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:18,890
it comes from vulnerability scan

1122
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,840
whatever the case is here and sometimes

1123
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,810
just period this is a a very critical

1124
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,580
system running on a really old platform

1125
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:27,860
and we're just going to take a look at

1126
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,819
it because just just obviously you would

1127
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,150
Ryan kind of thing

1128
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:34,310
for instance hypothetically right if

1129
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,260
your entire backbone of your enterprise

1130
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,430
resource planning system running on NT 4

1131
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,350
in 2019

1132
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,750
that might be a box that I want to go

1133
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:44,000
take a hard look at right like a really

1134
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,170
deep look at and by the way - if you

1135
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,240
find yourself in that position please

1136
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,980
for the love a goodness segment your

1137
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,319
effing network right because it

1138
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,360
shouldn't be wide open to everybody in

1139
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,330
your workforce because because of course

1140
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,070
it shouldn't be right anyway so residual

1141
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,680
risk from breaches right this is a huge

1142
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:03,440
huge huge one this is where devaluation

1143
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,600
happens more than any other place right

1144
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,610
some devaluation and when I say

1145
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,380
devaluation what I mean is after the

1146
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,390
report oh by the way - if you're doing a

1147
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,240
lot of these even if they're driving

1148
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,790
distance away from you rent a car rent a

1149
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,040
car and buy the insurance because you

1150
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,930
are gonna make somebody mad I've had a

1151
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,880
rental car vandalized a couple of times

1152
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:25,370
now I totally get it

1153
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,870
I understand right I mean I'm not

1154
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:29,330
justifying it I'm just saying I

1155
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,890
understand right but but again get the

1156
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,610
rental insurance it's totally worth it

1157
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,640
anyway

1158
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:36,530
look the big devaluations though come

1159
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,569
from these residual risks from the

1160
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:40,130
breaches right this is the you've been

1161
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,630
breached and you didn't know it right

1162
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,580
that that's a very common event that we

1163
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,590
see when were threatened ting we find

1164
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,600
threats or what are the odds and then

1165
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:49,820
also looking at the old incident

1166
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,500
response reports right I did one of

1167
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,470
these a little over a year and a half

1168
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,390
ago where literally they delivered

1169
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,890
several of the IR reports to me and I

1170
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,609
looked at one in particular and I said

1171
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,190
okay cool

1172
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:03,560
where's the rest of the report the guy

1173
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,150
turns to me is like what do you mean

1174
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,400
unlike the rest of the report where's

1175
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,050
the unredacted copy I I know what you

1176
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,580
gave me I'm not an idiot I was born at

1177
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,040
night just not last night right he's

1178
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,990
like no no that's it and I'm my brother

1179
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,640
listen this is gonna be a really painful

1180
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,319
two weeks I mean he knew they were gonna

1181
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,700
acquire right we're at least in the

1182
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,260
process ice this can be really painful

1183
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,330
two weeks you keep lying to me and he's

1184
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,920
like he's like listen this has gotten

1185
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:28,759
borderline insulting I'm not lying to

1186
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,380
you I'm like oh snap right because what

1187
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,960
I thought was the redacted copy of the

1188
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,520
report was just the report right and

1189
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,910
they hadn't done an actual incident

1190
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:41,420
response they had brought in a private

1191
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:44,480
investigator who had no actual cyber

1192
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,910
experience but said he did and he helped

1193
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,370
them air quotes right navigate their way

1194
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,870
through a breach and didn't actually do

1195
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,310
computer forensics which turns out was

1196
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,259
actually required to figure out you know

1197
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,540
the scope of the data that left the

1198
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,090
organization right and this company got

1199
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,400
devalued by just over 15 million dollars

1200
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:04,040
on a 250 million dollar purchase right

1201
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,690
as a result of that risk now by the way

1202
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,370
if you think for a minute that that's

1203
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,750
that's all awesome right I don't get a

1204
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,970
percentage of that by the way I wish I

1205
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:13,280
did that'd be awesome too but the the

1206
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:15,529
owner of the company was so mad small

1207
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,210
co-write was so mad at me I mean he's

1208
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,920
like why'd you have to come in here and

1209
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,930
dig up on me dude it's my job like

1210
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,820
that's literally you're asking me to do

1211
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,649
my job poorly alright he's like if you

1212
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,300
could just not like dig any further into

1213
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,040
this like every time you ask for new

1214
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,810
evidence in this this breach that we

1215
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,400
handled a year ago my first off let me

1216
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,500
stop you here you didn't handle the

1217
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,150
breach a year ago I get it you tried to

1218
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,490
phone a friend right you called somebody

1219
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,320
was incompetent and sorry that that

1220
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,240
sucks sucks to be you it doesn't change

1221
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,800
the fact now that your data left the

1222
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,870
building right I mean and there's

1223
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,280
liability associated with that right he

1224
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,569
of course he thinks he's getting big you

1225
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,130
start talking about a founder owner or

1226
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,290
whatever and they devalue fifteen

1227
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,760
million dollars on a you know 250

1228
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,720
million dollar purchase that's money out

1229
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,900
of that guy's pocket

1230
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,250
I get why he's mad at me right but

1231
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,110
whatever yeah so you're not gonna make

1232
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,750
any friends doing this is another good

1233
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:04,220
another good point right but we find out

1234
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,570
as well that IT operates outside of

1235
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,100
change management procedures right

1236
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,390
generally while we're mediating your

1237
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,270
breach this is the other big thing I'm

1238
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:13,700
looking for what did you do in the

1239
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,050
moment to remediate the breach I can't

1240
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,600
tell you how many incidents that we work

1241
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:19,090
a rendition that are the result

1242
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,220
of a remediation from a previous

1243
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:22,360
incident right people are moving so fast

1244
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,160
cuz in the middle of an incident you're

1245
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,900
all like let's convene the change

1246
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,730
management boards so that we can put

1247
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,780
this firewall block in place right

1248
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,430
nobody does that

1249
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,530
somebody just like pops a firewall block

1250
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,319
in place I mean and then a week later

1251
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,760
suddenly there's a problem there like

1252
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,350
hold on a second so the firewall rule in

1253
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,860
the IP any idiot all right and they're

1254
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,990
like yeah

1255
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,580
problem resolved of course it was right

1256
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:44,709
now of course your problem is that you

1257
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,060
have a firewall that's wide open and now

1258
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,740
six months down the road you have an

1259
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,210
actual well an actual another breach

1260
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,540
right we obviously don't want that

1261
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,750
either

1262
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:54,520
right so talk about M&A challenges right

1263
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,600
so some of the cyber security and a

1264
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,670
challenge is the organization

1265
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,790
undervaluation has a strong incentive to

1266
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,410
lie to you period right and I'm gonna be

1267
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,020
straight up and say sometimes they're

1268
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,879
not maliciously lying so much as they

1269
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,770
just don't know and I get this right I

1270
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,360
get it it's kind of like going to my mom

1271
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,340
and saying hey is your computer safe and

1272
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,110
she's like yes my mom can break a phone

1273
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,330
from 30 feet away without even without

1274
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:18,790
even trying right so obviously a

1275
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:20,380
problematic there right I'll mention

1276
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,900
here that a lot of folks will try to

1277
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,660
reduce costs prior to M&A meaning they

1278
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,940
try to eliminate staff they try to maybe

1279
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,549
cut some Licensing's and service

1280
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,470
programs etc obviously this leads to

1281
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,930
additional risk as well the results are

1282
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:36,939
predictable right P&L is profit loss

1283
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,350
sheet for those that aren't aware of

1284
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,410
their but they're trying to basically

1285
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:43,420
increase their apparent value so again

1286
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,399
we always ask teams what the relative

1287
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,540
strength was versus 24 months ago this

1288
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,980
is one of the reasons I go on site

1289
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,620
because I get a chance to sit down

1290
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,300
individually with system admins I don't

1291
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,740
want like the boss in the room to that I

1292
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,150
hey we can facilitate some group

1293
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,700
interviews and I'm like no you won't

1294
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,230
right I want to talk individually to the

1295
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,899
guys and gals that are running this

1296
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:03,940
right and ask them what is your job like

1297
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,430
now what was your job like 24 months ago

1298
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,290
and and if nobody was there 24 months

1299
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:10,480
ago old buddy is that a red herring

1300
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,950
right because we now have a lot of

1301
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,980
technical debt in the organization

1302
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:17,290
there's a lot of turnover etc right so

1303
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,210
poor asset inventory this is obviously a

1304
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:21,190
huge problem asset inventory is hard to

1305
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,690
do but if you don't have an asset

1306
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,370
inventory you probably suck at

1307
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,260
protecting it it's hard to protect stuff

1308
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,670
you don't know about right this is

1309
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,370
another reason we do vulnerability scans

1310
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,010
because I'm looking at the Oh

1311
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:33,540
for all what do you know about vs. what

1312
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,010
do I know about and the delta between

1313
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,840
those is stuff you didn't know about

1314
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,090
right and that obviously is concerning

1315
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,410
to me right because again we probably

1316
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,420
don't have technical controls there now

1317
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,520
again you know in a two-week typically

1318
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,830
we do this in about a two-week period

1319
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:49,560
and a two-week period with generally

1320
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:52,140
about 320 to 400 man hours depending on

1321
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,820
the size of the org I cannot go through

1322
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,890
and identify every vulnerability I

1323
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,320
cannot go through and identify every

1324
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,120
problem to you know every risk to your

1325
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,250
merger and acquisition what I can do is

1326
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,450
I can look and say here are lots of

1327
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,430
things you didn't know about before

1328
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,109
right now right you didn't know about

1329
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,399
these they weren't being tracked there

1330
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,960
was they're not in the vulnerability

1331
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,670
management program and then we just

1332
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,230
assumed therefore worst case

1333
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,580
at least as far as reporting back we say

1334
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,170
look they didn't know about these you

1335
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,940
have to assume they're not being managed

1336
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,250
you have to assume at this point that

1337
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,480
they're you know potentially breach try

1338
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,860
and of course we do threat hunting on a

1339
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,390
lot of the stuff that wasn't known about

1340
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,150
there as well but again there's only so

1341
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,650
much time to to work all that out poor

1342
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,260
visibility I mean we talk a lot about

1343
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,510
visibility visibility invisibility SEM

1344
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,610
EDR NetFlow those are the big ones right

1345
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:37,860
centralized AV management may whatever

1346
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,750
but but the big one for me again it's

1347
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,280
Sam Edie are NetFlow those are the three

1348
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,290
things I absolutely need I've loved

1349
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,000
network traffic capture I'd absolutely

1350
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,920
love that if I can get it with TLS

1351
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,340
interception I love that too but again

1352
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,660
oftentimes don't get those so for

1353
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,040
stories I mean everybody needs more

1354
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,200
Michael Bay moments right with big

1355
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,170
explosions going off behind us right so

1356
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,899
it's not quickly about the the VMS or

1357
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:02,550
the VMS right so this is a really

1358
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,800
interesting one our scanning scope was

1359
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:06,780
very very limited due to ICS devices

1360
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,230
right and so this was a a large

1361
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:12,570
laboratory ish kind of thing right so

1362
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,860
super super limited because they're like

1363
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,840
if you knock any of our laboratory

1364
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,180
equipment offline huge huge financial

1365
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,580
impacts can't do that so walking to the

1366
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,960
server room because I always like to go

1367
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,640
see the server room I like to go see

1368
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,020
everything all right by the way one of

1369
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,190
the best things you do for cybersecurity

1370
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,430
I've got a lot of geeks in the room

1371
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:31,710
don't be a geek when somebody says do

1372
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:33,569
you want to see the answer is yes before

1373
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,160
they even finish what they do you want

1374
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,630
to see the answer is yes go see the

1375
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,040
business go see how the business

1376
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,440
operates you'll be a better

1377
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,390
cybersecurity practitioner for it I've

1378
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,339
only read this a few times right

1379
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,930
for instance I should have waited to

1380
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,009
hear the do you want to see the hypoxia

1381
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,960
chamber and the answer there is

1382
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,190
definitely yes and have you ever asked

1383
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,900
that it's definitely yes that's where

1384
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,700
they kill the pretty bunnies in the

1385
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,099
laboratory tests all right so I wish I'd

1386
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:59,009
missed that part but otherwise generally

1387
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:01,049
right the answer is yes right and so I

1388
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,579
walk into the server room there and in

1389
00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:04,950
the side of the server corner the server

1390
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,900
room there's this stack of old deck

1391
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,189
alphas there's three of them and they're

1392
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,049
sitting kind of one of them sitting kind

1393
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:11,819
of caddy corner the lids off at the top

1394
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:13,650
I'm like that doesn't look good

1395
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:16,049
right and I even asked I said oh you

1396
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,160
guys rotated off of those huh

1397
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:18,660
it's interesting that you haven't gotten

1398
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:23,578
rid of them the guys I got it's our part

1399
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:26,430
server I'm like for what all right and

1400
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:28,619
he's like well let me show you these two

1401
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,390
servers over here and he's like he's

1402
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:32,309
like this one is dev and this one's prod

1403
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:36,118
I'm like we're staging he's like that

1404
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:37,920
was staging so the other two part

1405
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,200
servers had been the extras and then

1406
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,390
staging eventually died and these are of

1407
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,519
an age that you can't even buy them on

1408
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,990
eBay kind of thing right I mean they are

1409
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:48,660
desperate for parts here and it turns

1410
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:50,430
out that oops somebody forgot to put in

1411
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,368
the disclosures and that over the last

1412
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:55,288
two years they had spent seven million

1413
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:57,150
dollars trying to rotate off of this

1414
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,339
business critical application and it

1415
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,049
failed to do it right on at least three

1416
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:03,180
occasions right so meaning they had had

1417
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:04,650
three projects and he totals seven

1418
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,899
million dollars from others is this a

1419
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:09,059
cybersecurity risk you've bet that's a

1420
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,680
cybersecurity risk right multiple

1421
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:13,920
cybersecurity risks because if you've

1422
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,899
used VMs you know it's all telnet all

1423
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,730
the time all right by the way for your

1424
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,279
hacker jeopardy folks that is port 23

1425
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:22,859
all right anyway so if you don't get the

1426
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:24,539
joke rock on but anyway so what about

1427
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:26,038
business-to-business VPNs all right

1428
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:29,400
during the initial intake we're told

1429
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:31,440
there's no b2v b2b VPNs first off if the

1430
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,049
answer is zero you're definitely lying

1431
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,880
or you just don't know right if they

1432
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:38,160
told me five I know I could be five

1433
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,049
right it was a smallish range small Co

1434
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,299
was maybe fifteen hundred users right

1435
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:45,150
well you tell me zero I'm like nope

1436
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:47,130
right I mean I got like 35 folks

1437
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:49,200
over or in addition we have multiple b2b

1438
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,240
VPNs right I'm not an idiot you don't

1439
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,210
have a zero what let's be realistic here

1440
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,939
right now there are zero yeah

1441
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:58,550
right so network monitoring quickly

1442
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,869
uncovered five always-on VPNs eventually

1443
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:02,809
we found more than a dozen on-demand

1444
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:03,950
business-to-business VPNs and one

1445
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:05,599
started monitoring it was clear

1446
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:08,450
confidential data was systematically

1447
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,740
being siphoned from the orgs ERP

1448
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:12,220
software enterprise resource planning

1449
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,939
software cybersecurity risk absolutely

1450
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,379
zero visibility

1451
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,050
and this isn't even a case where we have

1452
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,880
zero visibility this is a case where

1453
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:22,550
they didn't know they needed visibility

1454
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,440
they didn't know the VPN was there right

1455
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:26,690
um again this is the kind of stuff that

1456
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,190
if I just did sprout hunting alone I'm

1457
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,720
not going to uncover this is why we're

1458
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:31,579
doing a full package right we start by

1459
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,169
asking what do you have we do some

1460
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:34,400
network monitoring and then we jump into

1461
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,380
threat hanging we do vulnerability

1462
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,059
assessment again if I'm just red teaming

1463
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,069
I don't find this right if I don't bring

1464
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:41,599
taps in by the way as a whole nother

1465
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:43,160
complex issue right bringing your own

1466
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,290
taps dropping your network monitoring

1467
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,910
software in but again if we don't do

1468
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,290
this we don't find that right so it's

1469
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,759
got to be this full package and and

1470
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:52,009
again is you kind of walk through these

1471
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,720
stories right you'll notice here with

1472
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,190
the VMS we'd have found this through

1473
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,689
vulnerability scanning right I probably

1474
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,369
would not have found this because the

1475
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:00,260
way the application worked it never

1476
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:02,780
talks out to the Internet if I simply go

1477
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,819
drop north-south network monitoring in

1478
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,470
place I don't see this right so you'll

1479
00:50:04,819 --> 00:50:08,089
notice here over the stories walk

1480
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,589
through these five case studies you'll

1481
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,410
notice that each of these are kind of

1482
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:13,940
targeting different pieces I mean again

1483
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,470
holistically will miss stuff if we don't

1484
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,940
do a total package that's why I talked

1485
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:20,020
about earlier it's Red Team Blue Team

1486
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,790
GRC all right we need all three in place

1487
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:24,589
so then we got the sure we were mediated

1488
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:27,710
I loved this I mean we always asked over

1489
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:29,480
the past 24 to 36 months depending here

1490
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:31,040
they had experienced a major incident

1491
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,750
like loss of work meaning they sent

1492
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,700
people home from work incident with

1493
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,220
ransomware over the last 36 months right

1494
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,569
so on-site interviews of staff revealed

1495
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,490
two more incidents and they said one of

1496
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,960
them was where as we started talking it

1497
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,879
became clear one of them was an apt

1498
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,380
intrusion by the way I hate that term I

1499
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,900
just don't have a better one all right

1500
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,210
so but by the way anybody have a better

1501
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,940
acronym for apt than advanced persistent

1502
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:54,740
threat pain-in-the-butt yeah I like that

1503
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,410
my favorite one is a-holes playing tag

1504
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,359
but

1505
00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:00,220
one of the adequate fishing throughout

1506
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,110
take her pick basically we deployed our

1507
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,970
on-demand EDR scan the network found

1508
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,490
dozens of servers where the attacker

1509
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:08,140
simply swapped their malware out meaning

1510
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,669
they thought they had remediated and

1511
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,410
what they did they had a single IOC they

1512
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:13,450
said hey we know they're here because of

1513
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:15,100
this malware and they went around the

1514
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,419
network looking for that malware with

1515
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,400
that name I'd love to tell you that even

1516
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,450
did hashes that they did not they just

1517
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,100
literally look for malware in the

1518
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,839
autorun key with that specific

1519
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,000
executable name and that was that was

1520
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,940
the remediation right and of course we

1521
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,360
then found that breach from 36 months

1522
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,520
ago

1523
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,230
was just ongoing for the last 36 months

1524
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,700
right again this is not a good way to

1525
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,320
make friends I want to be very clear

1526
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:39,339
about this you will not make any friends

1527
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:41,020
doing this right yes anyway number four

1528
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,430
ain't sure we had an instant response I

1529
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,870
talked briefly about this an earlier it

1530
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,430
was clear the client suffered a breach

1531
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,950
they had not properly reported

1532
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:49,899
regulators small code got advised by

1533
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:51,580
that third-party PI firm right that they

1534
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:55,060
didn't need to disclose this is another

1535
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:57,700
problem right find a lawyer a private

1536
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:59,740
investigator is not a lawyer I am NOT a

1537
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,200
lawyer find a lawyer I'm actually

1538
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:04,509
looking at one right now but find a

1539
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,680
lawyer right and even if they're not

1540
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:07,750
well I would say even if they're not

1541
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,460
your lawyer find a lawyer make them your

1542
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,840
lawyer and have them advise you on this

1543
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,280
stuff right there one of the reasons

1544
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,080
that lawyers won't advise you in general

1545
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,580
is the liability like if they're not

1546
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,600
your client if you're not their client

1547
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,060
they won't advise you because the

1548
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:21,009
liability attached with that go find one

1549
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,870
who will advise you the cool thing is is

1550
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:25,420
of a lawyer totally steers you wrong you

1551
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:27,100
can at least go I went to a lawyer and

1552
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:29,230
they steered me wrong as opposed to like

1553
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,029
I call Joe the private investigator and

1554
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,660
he steered me wrong you don't want that

1555
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:34,570
right

1556
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,460
so I'm big Cody valued small Co right

1557
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:38,590
but more importantly again this is the

1558
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,940
big one here they filed disclosures none

1559
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:42,160
of the small code name instead of their

1560
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:44,380
own after the acquisition so now anybody

1561
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,629
that Google's big Co is not gonna see

1562
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,400
the big co had a breach right whereas

1563
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,710
and again I hate to bring up Marriott

1564
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,180
again right but but again just a reality

1565
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:54,160
right they bought Starwood they bottle

1566
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:59,410
the liability they want with it sucks to

1567
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:01,210
be them and finally maybe finally don't

1568
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,680
worry we have any virus right so here

1569
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,630
the acquiring organization was told

1570
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,020
there was an absolute clean bill of

1571
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,369
health

1572
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,559
all right absolutely in bill health

1573
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:11,539
unfortunately small co who was directly

1574
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:14,960
involved in contracts so intact to the

1575
00:53:11,539 --> 00:53:17,359
Chinese government and their clean bill

1576
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,240
of health was we haven't had any alarms

1577
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,650
that antivirus didn't clean meaning they

1578
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,200
were getting a lot of alarms that

1579
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:26,420
antivirus was cleaning air quotes right

1580
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,220
but somehow that was cool I guess I

1581
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,690
don't know anyway with the two hours

1582
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,890
installing network taps who discovered

1583
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,170
not one but two different groups

1584
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,460
operating in the network and let's be

1585
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,829
fair there was no reason for them to be

1586
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,380
stealthy all right apt well it basically

1587
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:41,630
advanced to the level you force them to

1588
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,220
write and here it was clear they didn't

1589
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,809
need to be stealthy so they were not all

1590
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,950
right we all said it in broadcast that

1591
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:47,660
we're a threat hunting all right see I

1592
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:49,460
hear stands for counterintelligence all

1593
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:51,230
right we are not like we're not emailing

1594
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,869
a bunch of you know system admins like

1595
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:55,759
hey please install the EDR software so

1596
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:57,559
we can begin hunting for Chinese apts

1597
00:53:55,759 --> 00:53:59,240
using the following indicators are

1598
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:00,890
compromised right you see if you've been

1599
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,149
to Fort Meade everybody and their

1600
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:04,640
brother out there has a bumper sticker

1601
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:06,200
that says I read your email and I just

1602
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,150
assume that every attacker is doing the

1603
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,558
same thing right so again think about

1604
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,599
the counterintelligence side as well

1605
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:14,269
they're closing thoughts all right every

1606
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,890
ma cyber severy in a has cyber security

1607
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:18,399
risks that extend to everybody involved

1608
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:20,569
right both parties small cone big coat

1609
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,339
identifying the risk will absolutely

1610
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:24,230
help adjust the valuation the

1611
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:26,900
acquisition right we have not done one

1612
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:30,559
of these yet where the cost to do the

1613
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:33,019
actual work has not resulted in a orders

1614
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,089
of magnitude larger devaluation of the

1615
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:37,069
organization all right so there's

1616
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:38,599
there's no reason from a financial

1617
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:39,890
saying forget the whole it'll help me

1618
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:41,569
sleep better at night right although

1619
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:43,400
that certainly could be good too

1620
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:46,519
risk avoidance risk understanding but

1621
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,349
but again routinely we are by orders of

1622
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:50,180
magnitude devaluing again I don't get

1623
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:51,890
into the valuation side it's that hand

1624
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,390
the wrist stuff back over the right we

1625
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:55,160
thought it was a quarter million but now

1626
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,749
it's 200 million kind of thing there's

1627
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,519
our quarter or a quarter billion now

1628
00:54:56,749 --> 00:55:00,618
it's 200 million right and again that's

1629
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:02,180
a common thing that happens here I'll

1630
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:03,859
say that orders that grow through M&A

1631
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:05,660
without systematically evaluating cyber

1632
00:55:03,859 --> 00:55:07,430
security risks they're literally giving

1633
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,259
a hand grenade to a toddler and when you

1634
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,759
hand a hand grenade to a toddler and

1635
00:55:09,259 --> 00:55:12,349
leave them in a room alone you should

1636
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:13,880
not be surprised to come back and find

1637
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:16,840
the room painted red and that's where

1638
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:21,170
all in thank you so much for your time

1639
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:22,190
so I think I have a whopping like no

1640
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:24,230
time for questions

1641
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:26,000
five-minute well is somebody here no

1642
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,410
we're okay now all right done there we

1643
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,820

1645

1646
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,060

1647
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,060
