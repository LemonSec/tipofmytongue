1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,779
the b-sides Nova 20/20 stream will begin

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,779
momentarily

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,009
they got this is useful I use this all

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,990
the time when I'm teaching I was two

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,700
days ago I was in West Virginia talking

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,070
about a OPSEC and kind of a force

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,660
protection speaking there and I love

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,610
this side because this is the site that

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,349
I always use the kind of hammer home you

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,000
need to be using different passwords on

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,560
these sites right every single site you

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,920
need to be using different passwords and

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,810
so you see there like okay some blackhat

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,060
world in 2014 that I had an account on

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,190
got pops on Bitcoin form in 2015 I had

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,960
an account got popped big deal well the

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,120
big deal is if that's the same password

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,160
or a very very close variant of the same

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,320
thing I use on my gmail or my online

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,910
banking or something more sensitive like

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,500
people do right people think they're

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,910
being creative it is hilarious for you

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,769
to stand up in front of a room this size

24
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,940
and talk about like okay if I tell your

25
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:58,289
password needs to be at least nine

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,210
characters how long is it room those

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,999
nine I tell you needs an uppercase

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,860
where's ago the front but I need special

29
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:07,050
character number what the back it is

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,640
people are predictable so we don't want

31
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,158
to reuse the same passwords I love this

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,409
as a teaching opportunity but for one

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,240
we're gonna talk about in here there are

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,500
lots of different people that do awesome

35
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,960
for a lot of different reasons right

36
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,910
threat intelligence law enforcement

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,229
investigations I don't care what it is

38
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,320
there's lots of different reasons but

39
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,630
probably the most common problem for

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,050
most people that duo cent is identity

41
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,789
resolution everyone who's done this for

42
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,170
more than about a week will have run

43
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,700
into this problem you have a phone

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,870
number you have an email address you

45
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,670
have a user name and you're trying to

46
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,170
find out who does this belong to you or

47
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,970
you're trying to find out more

48
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,950
information about the person that this

49
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,330
belongs to you that is steady-state like

50
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,280
I said you do this all the time and kind

51
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,050
of investigations even in threat

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,210
intelligence right corporations all the

53
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,590
time I saw like two months ago someone

54
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,300
from like what looked like an anonymous

55
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,220
gmail account just emailing and hey we

56
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,050
found a vulnerability on your site go

57
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,910
ahead and pay me otherwise I'm gonna do

58
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,380
some other stuff with it and now it's

59
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,880
like obviously you want to find out more

60
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,170
information about that person and

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,490
everything you can to try to figure it

62
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,230
out so there's a lots of different

63
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,598
reasons that people do this style of

64
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,310
work but the need is pretty universal to

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,140
take some selector like I said once

66
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,819
again an email a phone number a username

67
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,470
and convert that into more information

68
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,440
about the individual that identity

69
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,150
resolution and so with that in mind you

70
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,170
take one more look now at the slides

71
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,420
from how I've been poned and you realize

72
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,670
well shoot okay some blackhat world SEO

73
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,799
form I was on in 2014 got popped a big

74
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,589
deal but if this was our target right if

75
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,870
it wasn't me if this is our target date

76
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,970
of birth email address instant messenger

77
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,370
identities IP address password username

78
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,459
website activity if I can take that

79
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,110
email address to convert that into

80
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,720
username you know maybe other instant

81
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,830
messenger accounts the IP addresses and

82
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,660
obviously those are incredibly dynamic

83
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,670
but at least maybe I can narrow it down

84
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,799
to a region somewhere in the world this

85
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,600
is a lot of useful information that can

86
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,030
help me solve that identity resolution

87
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,230
problem and so with that in mind if

88
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,940
you're thinking like alright this seems

89
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,260
interesting how do I get started doing

90
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,769
this that's what we're gonna talk about

91
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,510
starting right now how do we find it the

92
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,850
first thing is just google it like

93
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,250
seriously kind of kidding kind of not I

94
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,230
actually had update this slide two days

95
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,750
ago because the original link was to a

96
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,160
stoat shady dot r u-- site that for some

97
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,180
reason went down in the past two weeks

98
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,150
so go figure

99
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,880
so yeah the darknet leaks are you are IP

100
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,440
maybe it'll come back maybe at wall but

101
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,850
the whole purpose the original slide

102
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,380
that i have of this until i modified it

103
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,180
two days ago and you go to that site and

104
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,190
you look at all the different breach

105
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,900
data lists they have down there we have

106
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,519
the file names right so now we can take

107
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,530
that file name and now we can search on

108
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,530
that and so I just grabbed the first one

109
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,720
there a vast 2014 400 K gray but now you

110
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,690
google that file name we found a hundred

111
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,430
and twenty seven other results in Google

112
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,799
or maybe now we can go find that file

113
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,810
and so now that the darknet leaks that

114
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,010
ru is down I actually had to switch over

115
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,620
to that other side save you see right

116
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,850
there deep web sites org that was one of

117
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,360
the sites that I was able to pivot to

118
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:04,060
from googling the file name once again

119
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,340
now this is kind of cool I went to that

120
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,320
site deep web sites org two days ago it

121
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,980
had probably like 30 breach datasets

122
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,690
there and then it had a list of other

123
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,609
breach datasets that were available on

124
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,709
this other site I tried to click on that

125
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,989
other site the site was down no longer

126
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,600
good not a big deal because we have our

127
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:26,620
old friend archive.org ret archive.org

128
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,960
is an effing vacuum cleaner or has like

129
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,700
google cache loads up kind of like the

130
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,229
blank shell of a webpage and then wants

131
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,180
to go grab all the resources from the

132
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,680
live site archive.org tries to grab

133
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,949
everything itself there

134
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,810
binaries that have not existed on the

135
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,639
internet for a decade that are still

136
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,840
sitting there on archive.org very very

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,310
specific datasets

138
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,989
I hoped a friend of mine once find a

139
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,669
file that really only existed for a week

140
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,259
and it was a legal reason the company

141
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,849
had to pull it back but you went back to

142
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,710
their website that specific week grabbed

143
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,660
the executable at a student one time

144
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,370
asked me how do I get a copy of poison

145
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,600
ivy I'm like go behind any truck stop

146
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,090
like that shouldn't do it like oh you

147
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,860
mean the malware am i bad that sites

148
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,289
been town for like a decade but we can

149
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,570
go to archive.org and grab a copy of it

150
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:11,080
so all of these datasets are still on

151
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,340
there as well when you start doing these

152
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,380
things when you start going to these

153
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,388
shady places use some form of protection

154
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,620
like I don't care what you use this is

155
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,180
going to talk on the OPSEC I don't have

156
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,550
the time to it but if you want to use

157
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,770
like VPNs or you want to use tor tales

158
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,810
you want to use VMs whatever it is but

159
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,698
use something right you probably should

160
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,160
at least give it some type of conscious

161
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,229
thought if your paranoia level is super

162
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,820
low and you just want to low Yolo it and

163
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,039
open it up like one tab away from your

164
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,469
online banking an email god bless you do

165
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:42,909
you do you you live your best life no

166
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:44,260
judgment here a distributed denial of

167
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,870
Secrets right this is kind of like

168
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,120
WikiLeaks like slightly classier cousin

169
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,710
like slightly classy or like they're

170
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,120
still from Florida but they don't use

171
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,109
meth yet and so you look and they're

172
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,729
sitting there leaking all this

173
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,130
information right and left and there it

174
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,050
says hey we got copies of the servers

175
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,370
from some bank in the Caymans where a

176
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,229
lot of shady Russians were due a

177
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,090
money-laundering you're like damn that

178
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,070
sounds kind of fun I wonder what they

179
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,049
mean by copies of the servers when they

180
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,139
say copies of the servers they mean

181
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,050
copies of the server's domain controller

182
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,389
exchange server sequel database like

183
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,460
everything right there massive massive

184
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,000
data files that are all there for the

185
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,169
taking

186
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,699
we're actually going to see the

187
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,620
screenshot one more time at the very

188
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,970
very end of the presentation when we're

189
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,770
talking about some digital forensics

190
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,450
stuff

191
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,280
Twitter searches right I'm sure like a

192
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,020
majority of people in this room at some

193
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,090
point went and downloaded something from

194
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,000
megaupload back in the day right for

195
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,890
reasons well kim comm was very resilient

196
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,840
so that got taken down but now we have

197
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,990
mega and z right it's kind of back in

198
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,119
the fold mega and z is a very very

199
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,190
popular place for people to upload reach

200
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,630
datasets there's a lot of other shady

201
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,160
places where people do it but they are a

202
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,930
pain in the butt for people to download

203
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,700
it and so it's kind of funny when you're

204
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,440
kind of hanging out in that community if

205
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,490
someone posts the data somewhere else

206
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,320
that's really kind of annoying people

207
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,330
they'll actually get yelled at like you

208
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,190
just post it on mega alright just please

209
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,349
go post it on mega there's a very very

210
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,820
strong draw for that and so the same way

211
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,860
like most people are familiar with

212
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,300
Google Dorking well we can use Google

213
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,700
dorky now to look for certain keywords

214
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,250
we're looking for anything from mega and

215
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,870
Z or here right not Google Dorking but

216
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,750
here we're Twitter Dorking so I'm just

217
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,240
doing a search for mega dot n Z and the

218
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,700
word linked and now we found 1.5 million

219
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,040
users Facebook data you know 106 Meg

220
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,349
file that just sitting out there hosted

221
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,880
on mega so like I said it's a very very

222
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,830
popular Google dork Twitter dork

223
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,200
wherever it is you want to search to

224
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:43,550
find some of this branch data torrents

225
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,570
torrents are fantastic if you can use

226
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,120
them right they're not just for

227
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,340
pay-per-view movies or other things some

228
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,830
of these datasets are massive collection

229
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,390
one is not the biggest data set out

230
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,450
there but still you see the collection

231
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,000
one link compressed up is still over 36

232
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,820
gigs in size downloading that from like

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,900
some shoddy shared host or some dot

234
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,550
onion or something else you're gonna

235
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,530
have a bad time like you're not gonna be

236
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,140
enjoying life so anytime you can

237
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,239
torrents are fantastic for some of these

238
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,010
large large data sets I think there's

239
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,350
one out there for collections 2 through

240
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,130
5 and through another dump called the

241
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,320
anti-public

242
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,479
it's over 100 gigs in size so if you're

243
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,219
gonna be downloading that you definitely

244
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,599
want to do it from a torrent it's always

245
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,190
worth checking these sites like Pirate

246
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,640
Bay or things for what you're looking

247
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:32,360
for raid forums

248
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,530
I love raid forums there are a lot of

249
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,390
forms out there where people kind of

250
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,218
trade this stuff people try to buy and

251
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,409
sell it raid forums is probably the most

252
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,940
popular one they have a ton of different

253
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,620
links on there you could just see a

254
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,550
small section of it there and there are

255
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,350
ways you can earn cred

256
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,149
but usually the most common ways people

257
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,620
just kind of buy them and then anytime

258
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:50,330
you want to unlock something it's eight

259
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,860
credits and it works out towards about

260
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,390
like a little over two dollars between

261
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,100
two and three dollars to unlock a

262
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,990
dataset and a lot of people absolutely

263
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,610
hate this they're like nope I refuse to

264
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,890
spend any money I'm supporting the

265
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,930
ecosystem like I totally get that right

266
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,819
I am in this talk I'm not trying to play

267
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,529
morality police everyone that knows me

268
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,480
knows I'm not morality police I would be

269
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,189
the murse morality police ever like I

270
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,920
wouldn't enforce anything just you do

271
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,390
whatever it is you want to do but like

272
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,760
said they have hundreds and hundreds of

273
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,199
reach datasets here that you can grab

274
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,060
for between two to three dollars worth

275
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,500
of credit if you were so inclined they

276
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,359
also have forums where people will talk

277
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,190
people will trade people will post

278
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,560
things that they want to buy or that

279
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,029
they want to sell and the forums are a

280
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,160
good time even if you don't want the

281
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,279
data the forums are a damn good time a

282
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,149
lot of times when people post things

283
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,730
it's pretty clear what they're trying to

284
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:39,980
do right like I want telecom data for

285
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,110
Spain right I'm looking for banking

286
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,600
information from like Qatar the UAE or

287
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,220
something okay five but sometimes people

288
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,360
post some wild stuff man there was

289
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,360
something about a month and a half ago

290
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,470
someone posted I'm looking for people in

291
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,730
the u.s. that have committed

292
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:59,000
white-collar crimes along with a list of

293
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,670
where they serve their time and what the

294
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,140
crime was

295
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,779
what's for lunch like damn that's

296
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,730
awesome I kind of wanted to reach out

297
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,320
like listen I do not have the data that

298
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,880
you're looking for but it sounds like

299
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,230
you got some Ocean's eleven going

300
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,290
on and I'm gonna be honest with you I

301
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,240
want in like whatever it is you got

302
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,589
going on here I want in on some of this

303
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,420
the accident even if you don't want data

304
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,160
the forms can be a really really good

305
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,860
time sometimes there was something wild

306
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,689
posted there just the other day there

307
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,190
are sites that just flat-out sell the

308
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,329
data right just right there

309
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,620
and let me tell you right now if you

310
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,810
think you're gonna find a better price

311
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,880
on two million Russian bank accounts go

312
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,079
out there and pounder right it's kind of

313
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,310
funny is a lot of times they try to

314
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,140
package it up as leads

315
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,609
yeah just lead generation here you go

316
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,740
I'm just a legitimate business selling

317
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,850
leads and when I first saw that I really

318
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,520
kind of started laughing like that's

319
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,430
ridiculous and you're like

320
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,360
damn it's actually not far off I it's

321
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,949
really not right isn't the difference

322
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
between leads and stuff like this just

323
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,610
basically if you stole the data or you

324
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,649
paid for it legitimately other than that

325
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,730
the end date it's like damn hats you're

326
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,290
really kind of sad when you think about

327
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,899
it but you can see they're from all over

328
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,990
the world banks Forex cryptocurrency

329
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,550
casinos whatever it is the data sets are

330
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,540
out there there's just too many of them

331
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:12,219
to list so now that we talked about

332
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,529
places where maybe you want to go find

333
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,149
some maybe you could go find some once

334
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,970
you find them you start downloading them

335
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:21,520
they add up very very quickly you know

336
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,260
thankfully storage is cheap like an 8

337
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,970
terabyte hard drive and I was like 150

338
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,010
bucks for a good one they're not that

339
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,480
much money then it just becomes a matter

340
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,640
of like I said the whole title of the

341
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,899
talk weaponizing the Deep Web but I mean

342
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,300
my weaponizing is how do we actually

343
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,010
take that data and make it usable

344
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,189
there's a couple different ways to do it

345
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,180
we'll talk about the easy way right here

346
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,339
first thing you do when you want to

347
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,959
ground some data and download it you

348
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,270
want to take a quick peek of the data to

349
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,040
see how it's organized right and people

350
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,620
that use Linux or very very familiar

351
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,230
with the term Pat these datasets are

352
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,250
huge they're absolutely huge and so

353
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,930
you're not gonna be able to open an

354
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,910
excel you're not gonna be able to open a

355
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,020
notepad or notepad plus plus or the

356
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,490
traditional ways that you would do

357
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,439
things the easiest way to look at this

358
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,910
is usually from a command line and so

359
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,920
people that know Linux like in this

360
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,790
group they know yeah I can just had cat

361
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,800
and content

362
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,290
copies of the file everything just there

363
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,430
goes pouring out to the screen but what

364
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,510
a lot of people don't know a lot of

365
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,250
people use Windows they don't know

366
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,020
Windows has the same thing right type

367
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,660
and so when you download this data set

368
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,130
you can't open it in Excel you can't

369
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,860
open in notepad plus plus there are

370
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,329
usually too big so we'll take it go to

371
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,220
the command line type the contents of

372
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:29,050
the file in which it starts pouring down

373
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,600
to the screen we can see kind of how the

374
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,270
data is formatted now I remember one

375
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,380
time I got a big breach data set a buddy

376
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,480
of mine working for a defense contractor

377
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,950
I let him know he's like hey or any of

378
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,209
our emails and they're like well what

379
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,260
are your emails look like he told me

380
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:44,319
great no problem

381
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,810
so now we modify that command slightly

382
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,279
differently so once again those who use

383
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,800
Linux they're familiar with cat and grep

384
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:53,800
right week at the contents of the file

385
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,910
we grep it - I for case insensitivity we

386
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,770
don't care for our keyword but for

387
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,600
pretty much everyone that uses windows

388
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,880
everyone's like damn you know like

389
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,010
windows has the equivalent of grep it

390
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,870
does and most people do not know that so

391
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,340
once again now we're typing the filename

392
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,650
to take all the output and pour it out

393
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,050
to the screen but now we're piping that

394
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,900
find string is like the Windows version

395
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,510
of grep - I for case insensitivity and

396
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,920
now our keyword and so right there

397
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,050
instead of just dumping the entire

398
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,660
MyFitnessPal data breach to the screen

399
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,089
I'm piping it to fine string - I

400
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,219
LaQuinta calm and I'm only seeing

401
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,750
results that have LaQuinta calm right

402
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,870
and for those of you that don't apply

403
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:39,260
espanol like kita is Spanish for next to

404
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:41,120
Denny's if you want to take this now

405
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,310
like this is the MGM Resorts right

406
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,630
you're like the MGM data breach it was

407
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,760
hot off the press like a week and a half

408
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,290
ago so this is that so I was working

409
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,750
with one organization it's like listen

410
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,250
we got like eight domains and we want to

411
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,350
see if any of our emails are in there

412
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,510
that's not a problem that's only gonna

413
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,280
take me like ten minutes top right cuz

414
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,020
once again I can cat the file name grep

415
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,030
it and now I can redirect the output

416
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,880
instead of to the screen to just some

417
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,800
file so I could do domain one dot txt

418
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,570
then I could do domain two dot txt I

419
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,280
could do the same thing on Windows took

420
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,780
me like 10 minutes to fit that need

421
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,189
there you go and you have your whole

422
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,170
list of all the emails that were in

423
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,120
there for your different domains not a

424
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,120
big deal super super easy to perform

425
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,250
one thing I was just talking about this

426
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,850
morning actually that I've been trying

427
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,670
to do a better job of is I feel like an

428
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,470
idiot like 99% of the time I truly do

429
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,360
but I forget that I've been doing this

430
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,830
style of work for like over a decade now

431
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,480
and so sometimes there's certain things

432
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,709
that I just kind of take for granted and

433
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,180
then I'm working with some of my

434
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,560
co-workers they're like oh my god that's

435
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,630
the most amazing thing ever right

436
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,550
something like the type and the fine

437
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,130
string sommelier oh yeah no I just you

438
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,329
know kind of I forget that not everyone

439
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,589
knows everything is like I said I

440
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:52,359
usually feel like an idiot but you

441
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,640
forget that you just accumulate a lot of

442
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,810
knowledge over time and so one thing is

443
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,630
I've done a ton of digital forensics

444
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,760
work and one of my favorite digital

445
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,279
forensics tools is a tool called bulk

446
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,220
extractor it's completely free and what

447
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,260
bulk extractor does is it combines kind

448
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,180
of strings and regex

449
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,560
so you stick it on a file it doesn't

450
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,870
matter what the file is it can be like

451
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,219
an executable it can be a disk image it

452
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,750
can just be a bunch of text files you

453
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,790
can stick on a directory it doesn't care

454
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,950
it's gonna gobble through that it's

455
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,870
going to actually extract any text that

456
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,089
it can find and then it's gonna look for

457
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,680
patterns that says this looks like an IP

458
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,000
address so it looks like an email this

459
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,620
looks like a phone number right this

460
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,540
looks like a MAC address this looks like

461
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,190
a domains there's a Facebook user ID

462
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,589
it's going to try to suck that out

463
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,970
automatically and generate text files

464
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:39,040
for each one of these types of patterns

465
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,810
that it finds it's an amazing digital

466
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,120
forensics tool it's one of my all-time

467
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,640
favorites we can use it in this type of

468
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,370
field too because I guarantee you in a

469
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,860
room this size I am not the only one who

470
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,959
at work usually I'm asked to do things

471
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,360
and my deadlines are in minutes right

472
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,920
like not days not weeks but in minutes

473
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,020
that I need to kind of produce results

474
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,870
and so what I'll refer to is just like

475
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,510
an absolute smash-and-grab of selectors

476
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,579
like it's not perfect it's not gonna be

477
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,990
the prettiest thing in the world but

478
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,300
it's just really really good at sucking

479
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,010
out email addresses phone numbers IP

480
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,680
addresses and anything else like we have

481
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,630
from a data set so a couple months ago a

482
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,279
data set got out there from a s site

483
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,740
called iron March and this was a place

484
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,540
online were a bunch of Nazis hung out

485
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,190
and when I say Nazis I don't mean like

486
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,319
people who disagree to view on Twitter

487
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,690
so you called them Nazis but actual like

488
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,610
Indiana Jones Nazis right they're

489
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,949
hanging out there the data got out there

490
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,620
everyone started poring over it for Osen

491
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,240
doing it now

492
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,250
so suffer because Nazis are not the most

493
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,630
sympathetic folks out there right no

494
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,130
one's really sticking up for the Nazi

495
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,080
saying hey you guys really shouldn't be

496
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,210
doing that so I jumped in on it too why

497
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,170
not and so then I wrote this blog post

498
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:50,240
of just super quick bulk extractor SiC

499
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,949
it on it probably like two minutes later

500
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,150
I just had a list of all the selectors

501
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,440
so they were my works like hey do you

502
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,550
have the IP addresses from there do you

503
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,320
have the phone numbers from there damn

504
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,270
yep yep yep here they are like I said it

505
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,770
may not be perfect but it is a very very

506
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,510
good job and it does it very very

507
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:06,470
quickly and sometimes that's what we

508
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,359
need depending on what we're doing all

509
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,490
these different data sets in all these

510
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,899
different formats you can try to take

511
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,429
them and you're like oh I'm just gonna

512
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,780
insert those into a database I'm just

513
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,339
gonna make a database a different table

514
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,199
for every breach just start inserting

515
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,909
records in there you can like you

516
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,280
absolutely can you're gonna have a bad

517
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,410
time it's a pain in the ass it is

518
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,599
some of the data sets aren't normalized

519
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,949
as much as you want them to be different

520
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,850
things will just kind of change you're

521
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,260
sitting there doing all sudden like

522
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,520
there's a new column that pops up you're

523
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,590
not sure where it came from

524
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,690
the the best software engineer I know

525
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,330
did this with a couple data sets into

526
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,980
AWS and she got it done like she did

527
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,870
kicked butt and the lookups were super

528
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,210
super quick but it was a pain in the

529
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,370
butt to do and so doing this across like

530
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,800
hundreds and hundreds of data sets is

531
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,439
the pain like I said it can be done you

532
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,850
can't do it and if you're that good with

533
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,020
the databases and you want to do it and

534
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,610
nothing I give you in this talk is

535
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,260
really gonna help you with it maybe or

536
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,939
to find it or what we can do with it but

537
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,230
for those that don't want to go do that

538
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,880
right for those that are like I am a

539
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,920
little too lazy for that and I kind of

540
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,010
don't want to go down that road I got

541
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,840
you all right so once again back to kind

542
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,900
of the forensics roots years ago in a

543
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,740
forensics class I learned about a tool

544
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:19,640
called agent ransack an agent ransack is

545
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,290
designed to let you search quickly kind

546
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,290
of search hard drives for information

547
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,059
they have a pretty and it's free they

548
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,879
have a professional version called the

549
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:30,770
file locator Pro and I hate bringing up

550
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,270
anything that costs money every time I

551
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,610
do a talk I always try to live on myself

552
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,410
to free things but in this regard file

553
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,570
locator Pro I think was 40 when I first

554
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,580
got it it's up to 60 right now it has a

555
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,649
lot of features that agent ransack

556
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,600
doesn't and the most important feature

557
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,720
the one that we need right here is the

558
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,149
future of

559
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,790
dexing right indexing once again it's

560
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,350
kind of a forensics concept they're

561
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:57,600
really ironically isn't used much in

562
00:18:52,350 --> 00:19:01,379
forensics anymore this is what indexing

563
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,530
does it lets us trade storage space and

564
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,890
effort now in exchange for quicker

565
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,360
searches in the future what does that

566
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,520
mean let's take a quick look at the math

567
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,500
so this is just one data set I think

568
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,450
this was a one of the collection two

569
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,800
chunks 126 gigs of raw data searching

570
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,510
that for a selector for like an email

571
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,360
address it's kind of take about 50

572
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,250
minutes that's not tenable I struck a

573
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,449
scale that out start to say you like you

574
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,060
have like okay I've got four or five

575
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,380
terabytes of reach data and now if I

576
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,590
want to search an email or a phone

577
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,970
number it's gonna take me like a day

578
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,770
that's not okay because a lot of times

579
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,260
you get selectors you get them in chunks

580
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:43,620
that's it's not good enough for most of

581
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:48,030
us on what we do so we can solve that by

582
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:51,239
making an index an index for that took

583
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:54,090
about two days to make took up an extra

584
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,220
seventy three gigs in size but then when

585
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,899
we were done our searchers are taking

586
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,280
two minutes instead of fifty and now

587
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,960
we're down to a much much more

588
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,210
reasonable size now we can search

589
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,190
terabytes of data in a matter of like

590
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,500
half an hour or less for our selector

591
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,480
and now we have it like I said for lack

592
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,910
of a better term weaponized it's in a

593
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:18,120
much more useful format I don't like the

594
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,070
GUI that comes with a locator Pro I

595
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,020
don't the same way when you type

596
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,490
something into Google it starts to like

597
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,750
autosuggest and kind of make

598
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,730
recommendations on what you want to

599
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,930
search it does that too and that might

600
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,150
be fine if I'm just searching like a

601
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:33,030
directory of files but across terabytes

602
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,070
of data it's slow it bogs down and I

603
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,810
just don't like it and so what I do is

604
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,520
they have a command line interface and

605
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,560
so what I did I wrote this is ghetto

606
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,200
ghetto Python code it's like seven he

607
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,610
just ugly lines of Python but what it

608
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,590
does is just a wrapper around the

609
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,899
command line interface and so now you

610
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,310
can just give it a txt files I posted on

611
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,560
github it's called duck hunt cuz I'm a

612
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,179
seven year old you can just give it a

613
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,889
txt file full of selectors right like

614
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,990
user names from emails phone numbers

615
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,690
whatever it is push go

616
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,790
it has two lists of indexes in there one

617
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,950
for I want to search every piece of data

618
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,450
you have indexed the others I only want

619
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,620
to search datasets that actually have

620
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,940
phone numbers in them so if your

621
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,678
selectors your only phone numbers

622
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,210
don't waste time searching datasets that

623
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,120
don't have phone numbers in them and

624
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:18,270
when it is done doing that it spits out

625
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,010
a nice at least decent HTML report of

626
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,440
all your results with the terms that are

627
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:25,170
there bolded highlighted so to prove I'm

628
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,179
seven that is a copy of the report right

629
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,940
there like I said it's a very very short

630
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,740
Python file but it's 55 K in size and

631
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,840
it's because almost all of it is a

632
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,970
base64 of that JPEG that it inserts in

633
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,439
the header because I'm seven but like I

634
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,850
said if you want to go down this road if

635
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,350
you want to start using it take that

636
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,059
modify it whatever it is you want to do

637
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,889
but if you're gonna search large number

638
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,350
of selectors I found it easier to just

639
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,910
put them into a text file push go go do

640
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,169
whatever it is I want to do come back

641
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,429
later and kind of look through the

642
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,429
report to see the results

643
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,840
if you were going to go down that route

644
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,668
I would also highly suggest in my github

645
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,110
where I had there I have a link to this

646
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,880
blog post that I wrote a couple weeks

647
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,529
ago and check it out there's a couple of

648
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,020
idiosyncrasies of the way it does

649
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:09,850
searches and then it's not deal-breakers

650
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,168
like I still use it but there's a few

651
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,059
things that I wish I would have known

652
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,799
when I started indexing and I started

653
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,270
doing some of these searches and so I

654
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,650
just kind of tried to write up an

655
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,720
article for ya this is stuff that I wish

656
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,250
I would have known when I started doing

657
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,169
this so if you're gonna do it I would

658
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:27,279
highly recommend you at least give that

659
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:29,409
a quick scan all right this is the

660
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,950
funnest part of the entire talk right

661
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:34,120
we've talked about how to find it talked

662
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,010
about how we can make it in a more

663
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,270
usable format easier like I said if you

664
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,760
wanna take the time to jump into a DBE

665
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,139
god bless you but kind of a lazy way

666
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,360
we're just push go come back two days

667
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,830
later and now it's more usable now we'll

668
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,168
talk about the fun stuff right how can

669
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,029
it actually help us because that's the

670
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:51,039
thing is like I had someone like two

671
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:52,659
nights ago like hey you know yeah well

672
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,158
what are you talking on like breach data

673
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:54,850
like how we can use it like what to

674
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,409
commit crimes

675
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:00,250
I don't think you'll have to wait and

676
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:02,679
see the talk right maybe the easiest

677
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,690
sell of all by a mile pen testers pen

678
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,179
testers red teamers offensive operations

679
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,039
by a mile the easiest sell of this type

680
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:13,480
of information trying to figure out

681
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,309
usernames and their passwords to then

682
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,899
use that to access systems and that's

683
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:19,178
kind of a bread and butter technique to

684
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:21,158
go through that and spoiler alert right

685
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:24,010
people tend to reuse passwords pretty

686
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,600
much everyone does there used to be a

687
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,158
service that would try to cater to this

688
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,570
called pwned list right they haven't

689
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,429
been around in a while so you can see I

690
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,139
actually had to go to wayback machine to

691
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:33,760
get a screenshot but I remember the

692
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,260
first time I ever saw a demo of this it

693
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,450
was just like jaw-dropping I'm like holy

694
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,190
crap that's crazy and what it was is

695
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,399
they had compiled a bunch of the breach

696
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,289
data you can see they're like over 866

697
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:45,820
million account credentials harvested

698
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,049
all these different leaks all those

699
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,939
different passwords they've collected

700
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:52,059
and they would take this it was very

701
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,409
very expensive I remember that but you

702
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:56,408
could access and then if you're like hey

703
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:57,880
I I want to see any passwords you have

704
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,710
for any Cisco accounts right in your

705
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,909
Tesla accounts whatever it is then you

706
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,770
could get the results I remember the

707
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:04,539
first time I saw a demo someone searched

708
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,250
like Cisco there was a ton of results

709
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,810
someone searched FBI doc

710
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,910
there was a ton of results of different

711
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,800
like fbi.gov emails in the past words

712
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,690
all my holy crap that's crazy alright it

713
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,490
was just a super super expensive service

714
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,540
they got bought out acquired I think

715
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,970
they're technically under still one

716
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,500
under Allstate now but also now what

717
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,790
seemed crazy back then I'm like oh yeah

718
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,650
I know you can just totally do that

719
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,330
yourself you can do that yourself on

720
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,100
just some old janky computer you have

721
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,340
and these stuff like an 8 terabyte hard

722
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,929
drive in right and so now I usually when

723
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,720
I'm teaching more technical classes I

724
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,160
usually use Tesla as my offer a lot of

725
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,990
my examples because they have a bug

726
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,970
bounty program it's very very easy to

727
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,500
register with and so there you can see I

728
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,420
looked through Tesla results we found

729
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,250
her right there and there was I blurt

730
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,140
out the who had actually belongs to but

731
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,600
Tesla comm and their password was

732
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,150
viewsonic won with a capital v this is

733
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,580
actually a brilliant password think

734
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,590
about it everyone in here that social

735
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,590
engineering what do you look for you're

736
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:02,530
looking for post-it notes on monitors

737
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:04,510
this is meta alright they're not doing a

738
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,760
post-it note on the monitor is the

739
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:09,640
password it's actually the monitor brand

740
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,860
name itself like that's brilliant

741
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,930
it's effin brilliant I wish I would have

742
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,879
thought of that right I wish I would

743
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,400
have thought of that alright

744
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,100
how can it help me if we do threat Intel

745
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,300
or blue team that is probably a majority

746
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,649
of the people we have in here we

747
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,419
probably have more of that than we do

748
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:30,120
anything else there's a few different

749
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,120
ways right number one fake accounts

750
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,949
like I said most of us in here probably

751
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,049
familiar with have I've been poned I'm

752
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,160
not gonna ask for a show of hands but if

753
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:40,270
I ask people who's in there it's

754
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,410
probably gonna be a majority of this

755
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,240
honestly like people that work in this

756
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,100
industry may not think so but no one is

757
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,929
better at detecting fraud than financial

758
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,340
so they just aren't right I remember one

759
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,020
time I have my credit card ripped off

760
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,909
and like 20 minutes later they're

761
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,840
calling me and they're like yeah we're

762
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,340
calling you up because you're do you

763
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,809
have your credit card Oh much no I don't

764
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,129
know yeah someone tried to swipe and

765
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:59,570
grab something from a Reb box and then

766
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,490
try to buy a TD a Walmart and you're

767
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,720
like that's almost passable is something

768
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,100
that I would have tried to do though but

769
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,840
they flagged it they caught it instantly

770
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,219
god bless you they look at a lot of

771
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,260
different things to try to do that right

772
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,669
like I said they do an amazing job one

773
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,950
of the things they look at is this think

774
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,419
about this if someone hires you and

775
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,490
you're sitting there trying to basically

776
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:18,380
come up with algorithms and trying to

777
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,409
find a series of checks and balances to

778
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,909
determine if this is a real person

779
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:24,500
everyone in here has a primary email

780
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:27,320
they use write them for most of us is

781
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,049
probably a gmail if that gmail address

782
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,860
of your primary email address isn't and

783
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:33,500
have I been pwned

784
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,199
are you real like seriously like is that

785
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,400
it seriously it's kind of sad and the

786
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,960
state needs to say that but between

787
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,100
these some of these massive dumps that

788
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,990
are out there the lists that are on

789
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,570
their LinkedIn you know all these

790
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,880
different hacks if your primary email is

791
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,460
not in this breach data set that is a

792
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,140
point towards you not being real and

793
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,220
like I said it's not the only one I was

794
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,900
actually looking someone up the other

795
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,980
day that wasn't in there like wow okay

796
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,350
and it looked like it was their real

797
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,210
gmail address but that's definitely a

798
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,439
point to the negative ledger and this is

799
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,090
one of those things like that actually

800
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,890
financials in different industries are

801
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,870
utilizing this information like this if

802
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,070
you're in there cool as a point towards

803
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,959
you being a real person if you're not

804
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,189
it's kind of a point in the negative

805
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,970
column I got on that it's not definitive

806
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,409
but it's useful another way is this

807
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,960
let's all get together now let's start

808
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:19,760
up a business we'll call it a Arlington

809
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,159
widgets com right well go out and grab

810
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,080
Arlington widgets calm we'll use that as

811
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,470
our email we all have Arlington calm

812
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,049
Arlington widgets calm email addresses

813
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,909
we can go to having been poned prove

814
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:34,400
that we own the rights to Arlington

815
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:37,250
widgets comm and now it will give us a

816
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,750
notification of any of our email

817
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,919
addresses that appeared and you breach

818
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,679
that they find were like damn that's

819
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,210
useful and it is if now we kind of

820
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,070
expand and we end up with like maybe

821
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,120
eight different email domains long now

822
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,789
it's a little bit more of a pain in the

823
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,809
ass but we can still do it but what

824
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:55,580
happens if we run a service and we just

825
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:57,260
let people sign up with their Gmail with

826
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,840
our hotmail with our Yahoo whatever it

827
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,760
is that they have but well now it's kind

828
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,908
of a pain now we can't do this anymore

829
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,470
right even if we could take a list of

830
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:08,929
our users and upload it are legal would

831
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,549
never let us do that and so if we're

832
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,200
concerned with this type of thing if we

833
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:14,090
want to monitor it we kind of really

834
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,880
only have two things we either pay

835
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:18,049
someone else to do it for us all right

836
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,090
we can just throw money at the problem

837
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:22,580
that usually fixes it huh

838
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,439
or we can kind of do this ourself doing

839
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,360
the methodology and it doesn't have to

840
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,159
be even a real-time look up I was

841
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,678
working with an Oregon Segoe they had a

842
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,539
sharp uptick in accounts taken over

843
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:33,860
compromised the site it just just give

844
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:35,809
me like a dozen oh and just give me like

845
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,158
a dozen of your accounts that you know

846
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:42,530
of them popped cool first one I'm like

847
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:44,740
is their password this they compute the

848
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:50,059
hash yeah

849
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:53,090
next one password this yeah let's do one

850
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:54,559
more to be sure their password this yeah

851
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,240
all right they're all coming from

852
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,559
collection one like everything I'm

853
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,940
seeing this for a collection water right

854
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,320
and so now then you could get what

855
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,669
they're legal and they can kind of make

856
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,500
the decision listen if you have any

857
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,480
other users that are in here you may

858
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,120
want to force them to reset or maybe at

859
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,860
least compute the hash see if that's the

860
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,959
same password that y'all are storing and

861
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,580
then force them the reset but at least

862
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,409
now you can make an educated decision as

863
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,789
this attack you're seeing right what is

864
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:18,230
the source that it's coming from that's

865
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,760
what thread intelligence is all about

866
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,440
and they can kind of make an informed

867
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,879
defense and kind of deal with this and

868
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,520
know what you're dealing with in a more

869
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,580
educated and manner

870
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,770
all right how can it help me OSINT

871
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,840
analysis this is the big one right this

872
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,639
is a except we probably have more threat

873
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,100
Intel than we have anything else in the

874
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,450
room bro dosent is probably second place

875
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,949
true it there is a tried and true for

876
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,080
anyone that does OSINT in this room

877
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,560
there is a tried and true technique that

878
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:51,169
has been usable for years and it's this

879
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,790
think about the identity resolution

880
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,220
problem and how hard that is to solve

881
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,170
now think about all the apps that we use

882
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,090
on their phone right we use whatsapp we

883
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,550
use signal we use all of these different

884
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,409
apps remember back to when you first

885
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:06,740
installed whatsapp or whatever it is is

886
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:09,590
used for third party texting did you

887
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,140
have to sit there like a caveman or a

888
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,060
barbarian and enter in all your contacts

889
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,530
again to see who was using that no we

890
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,070
just said hey go search my contacts for

891
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,020
friends

892
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,490
here's your 68 friends that are using

893
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,110
whatsapp or signal whatever it is a

894
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,800
vehicle and do so you know go live your

895
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:26,659
life this is tough to scale but that is

896
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,730
a fantastic solution to the identity

897
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,530
resolution problem because if your

898
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,300
threat intelligence right and like an

899
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,860
executive gets a threat you get a threat

900
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,780
against something you have a phone

901
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,159
number you're like okay cool well we

902
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,170
paid a lot of money so I have like

903
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,090
LexisNexis or I have access to all these

904
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,760
databases and you search it up and what

905
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,679
does it come back to Verizon DBA prepaid

906
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,540
cell code something someone's spent 30

907
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,850
bucks for down at the circle-k

908
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,879
and you're not any further than you were

909
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:55,669
10 minutes ago but if they took that

910
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,590
number and then they signed up for like

911
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,660
a snapchat right like a whatsapp like a

912
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,730
signal something else now what you can

913
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,310
do with this is a tried-and-true OSINT

914
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,050
technique we take that number we put it

915
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,419
in as a contact of our Android phone or

916
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,680
an emulator we go to snapchat whatsapp

917
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,720
whatever's popular in that country say

918
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,610
hey I'm new here search my contacts for

919
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,380
friends oh here's your friend right here

920
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,120
well now we just took that phone number

921
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,310
and turn that into a name a username a

922
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,290
profile picture a lot of times all that

923
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,060
information I teach Oh sends a lot

924
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,350
during the day for my day job as you can

925
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:28,879
tell that is a tried-and-true technique

926
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:30,620
that usually works the whole concept of

927
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,540
searching contacts for accounts that's

928
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,250
not going away because none of us want

929
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,559
to sit there and put in all our contacts

930
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,860
but it's not as cool as it was

931
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,178
before last September because up until

932
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,639
then it worked for pretty much

933
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:45,379
everything out there but in September

934
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:47,658
now it really doesn't work for Facebook

935
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:49,100
and Instagram anymore all right it

936
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:50,899
doesn't it's kind of a little different

937
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,219
I kind of let it simmer kind of brush up

938
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:53,748
against their contacts and maybe a

939
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,999
little float to the top but it's not

940
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:59,210
that definitive answer like we get for

941
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:00,470
everything else and I have no friends

942
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,669
that work there and even if I did

943
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,830
they're not going to tell you why they

944
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,840
did it but sometimes even though they

945
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,158
won't tell you why they did it you sit

946
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,658
there and kind of put multiple things

947
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,690
together and what happened last

948
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:14,119
September is some massive datasets got

949
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:17,299
found online for Instagram and Facebook

950
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:19,100
users like Facebook to the tune of 264

951
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:20,840
million Facebook accounts and been

952
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,399
enumerated and it looked like someone

953
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,869
who sees them probably like a weakness

954
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,729
and the API and the way Facebook

955
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:27,168
Messenger works because at that point

956
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,320
that's what people are using to kind of

957
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:31,700
search Facebook phone numbers but

958
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,289
whatever it is like I said I'm not

959
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,029
saying this is why Facebook did it just

960
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:37,039
trying to judge what happened and what

961
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:38,240
their reaction was but all of a sudden

962
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,610
the search techniques like that don't

963
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,929
work anymore so it usually works but it

964
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,439
ain't working with Facebook or Instagram

965
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:47,419
unfortunately and so once again maybe

966
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,919
it's breach data right maybe Bruce yet

967
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,629
it can help us because I given this talk

968
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,029
one time before I gave it about a two

969
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:55,009
weeks ago at the sans o cents summit and

970
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:56,480
someone putting it on the OP putting on

971
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:57,679
the summit said something after the fact

972
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,840
that I honestly never even thought about

973
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,399
they said yeah before I had always just

974
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,749
thought about breach in his emails and

975
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:05,059
passwords I didn't think about anything

976
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:06,769
else like oh no that for a lot of the

977
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:08,570
data sets that's what there is but for a

978
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:10,309
lot of the data sets there's a lot more

979
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,110
in there including things like phone

980
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:14,389
numbers and that can help us solve the

981
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:17,019
identity resolution problem and so here

982
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:21,199
is a heavily redacted screenshot I

983
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:23,029
believe this was the is the MGM data

984
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,980
from looking at it I know this might be

985
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:26,539
designed good data actually and so you

986
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,789
can start the scene we have addresses

987
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:30,679
right we have Gmail accounts I've

988
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,600
blurred out quite a bit of it but we

989
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,999
have phone numbers up there all of this

990
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,889
types of information even if we didn't

991
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:38,749
have Facebook data maybe we have other

992
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,189
data that people like everyone uses I'm

993
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:42,529
gonna play Facebook games people it's

994
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,820
very very popular very very common they

995
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:45,679
had a big breach a couple months ago

996
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,260
that data sets out there and not that

997
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,930
hard to find my boss's cell phone is not

998
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,400
show up in any system you got but if you

999
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,020
take that cell phone number and you run

1000
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,680
it through the zanga breach data there's

1001
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,230
his name

1002
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,240
there's his gmail address and there's a

1003
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,340
lot of other information about him and

1004
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,600
so once again for people to do Oh SIM

1005
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,189
for investigations for threat

1006
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,709
intelligence why ever it is you do it

1007
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:09,080
that identity a resolution problem this

1008
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,159
can be a tremendous aid and helping us

1009
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,139
to figure it out

1010
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,490
and speaking of Facebook I had to show

1011
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,409
at least a little bit of Facebook data

1012
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,770
right there once again I had heavily

1013
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:20,450
blurred this out but we can see Connie

1014
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:22,699
she was born in the 70s over there in

1015
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:24,859
the far right her phone number starts

1016
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,379
off with a 7 1 7 she was last on

1017
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,790
February 2nd 2019 from whenever this

1018
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,090
breached it was taken it was taken in

1019
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:36,139
early 2019 she has a AOL email account

1020
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:37,490
so you know she's tech savvy but here's

1021
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,260
millions and millions of Facebook

1022
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,209
records with email with phone numbers

1023
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,130
and everything else once again I'm not

1024
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,870
let me be very very clear I'm not happy

1025
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,280
these things got breached right I'm not

1026
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,560
happy about this any way shape or form

1027
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,510
but they're out there and do we think

1028
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,860
our adversaries are using them like hell

1029
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,750
yeah our adversaries are using right

1030
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,340
it's a tried-and-true technique and I

1031
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,110
said it's pretty easy when you start

1032
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,880
getting accounts pop to go back and

1033
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:02,000
figure out bless you exactly what

1034
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,140
breaches that they're using so if you

1035
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,310
want to leave look things up like I said

1036
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm not the morality please

1037
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,660
some people hate this stuff and say they

1038
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,460
would never use it cool some people are

1039
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,720
like no no I'm going after really really

1040
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,100
bad people I'm trying to figure out this

1041
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,480
thing that I need to figure out it's

1042
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,839
gonna help me I'm gonna use it great

1043
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,240
like I said there's no judgement combo

1044
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,370
lists right you will see this

1045
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,080
nomenclature a lot if you start playing

1046
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,880
out in this ecosystem and looking for

1047
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,270
things and what a combo list is this

1048
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,470
right what's super super useful is when

1049
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:32,660
you just have breach data sent right

1050
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,890
here's the MGM data here's the Dropbox

1051
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,810
data here's the LinkedIn data the

1052
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,160
MyFitnessPal whatever it is it's a data

1053
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,380
set you know where it came from you can

1054
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,660
usually look at it and verify like yep

1055
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,830
nope that's pretty real right the MGM

1056
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,390
data that just hit like a week and a

1057
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,069
half ago when I did that example

1058
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,930
screenshot and I search for example.com

1059
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,700
I actually got a hit I'm like wait what

1060
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,799
it was the first record in the data set

1061
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,240
and it was then putting in like the test

1062
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,460
data with an email address at

1063
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,250
example.com alright yeah that looks

1064
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,320
legit but some people don't care about

1065
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,319
using this research some people all they

1066
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,479
care about

1067
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,969
is just a straight-up I just want logins

1068
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:07,379
and emails and I want the passwords and

1069
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:08,940
so what they will do is they will make

1070
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,890
combo lists they will take a bunch of

1071
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,900
different breat like here's like 50

1072
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,029
Bitcoin sites that I popped I compiled

1073
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,670
all the user accounts and passwords and

1074
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:19,920
I'm just dumping it into a combo list so

1075
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,959
for o cent research these are much much

1076
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,940
less useful right we just don't have the

1077
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:26,009
provenance sometimes to you can even

1078
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,869
tell they kind of mutate passwords like

1079
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:29,190
I use a password like that's really

1080
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:30,690
close to a password I've used but not

1081
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,779
exactly and it's because they're kind of

1082
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,279
mutating and trying to guess yeah and so

1083
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:37,499
they're not as useful for OSINT but they

1084
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:38,880
still can have some use right so like I

1085
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:41,160
said once again a combo list is just

1086
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,719
gonna be emails and passwords can still

1087
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,269
be useful a couple months ago I was

1088
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,529
looking at some telegram chats had

1089
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,359
someone I believe was like a Russian

1090
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:51,180
threat actor in there they had a fairly

1091
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,680
unique username I took that username and

1092
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,969
I searched it and actually got a hit

1093
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,589
from a combo list of they're going

1094
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:58,920
through the hits and it was to that

1095
00:36:55,589 --> 00:37:01,979
username at hotmail.com and their

1096
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,319
password was a really nerdy Marvel comic

1097
00:37:01,979 --> 00:37:06,328
book reference followed by a number I'm

1098
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:08,819
like that ain't the Russian threat actor

1099
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:10,859
right it's not using a hotmail comm with

1100
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:12,930
his nerdy Marvel reference as the

1101
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:16,308
password scroll down through the results

1102
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:19,859
some more I find to ru email addresses

1103
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:22,650
same username same damn dorky password

1104
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:25,140
and I'm like I stand corrected you know

1105
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:27,469
and now I was like okay now I'm not 100%

1106
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,699
definitive that that's the same person

1107
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:30,930
but at least now I know that those three

1108
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:32,910
accounts I believe that they're tied

1109
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,769
together and I can start researching and

1110
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,410
trying to once again solve that identity

1111
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:39,779
resolution problem so combo lists not as

1112
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:44,009
handy as full dumps but they can still

1113
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:46,380
have value all right and the last one is

1114
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:49,910
we go to wrap it up the forensics

1115
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:52,069
practitioner at the DF ir

1116
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,950
I could stand here all day and play the

1117
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:57,109
password car absolutely I can play that

1118
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,089
card right when uh the other day last

1119
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:01,460
week I got asked by someone I was in a

1120
00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:02,538
Austin last week and I got asked by

1121
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,640
someone who was trying to crack a

1122
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:06,380
password from a a crypto currency wallet

1123
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,920
they're like ya know it's just brutal

1124
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,390
and man

1125
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,589
anyone who cracks passwords in here

1126
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,180
right who has a rig at home who uses

1127
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:12,828
hash cat you know some of those

1128
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,230
algorithms you smile when you see them

1129
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:17,990
stupid stupid easy sha-1 I love it

1130
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,520
some of those are stupid stupid slow or

1131
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,899
a stupid stupid slow and actually brute

1132
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,349
force that are even run through a giant

1133
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,450
dictionary it's kind of take a long time

1134
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:27,829
it really is probably the I think the

1135
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,509
slowest thing in Hash cat right now is

1136
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:31,190
probably iTunes backup right greater

1137
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,869
than ten you get something that's going

1138
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,520
through millions and millions of hashes

1139
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:38,240
for a slow other that's going through

1140
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,339
like 13 hashes a second for those iTunes

1141
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,470
backups a couple months ago I got in a

1142
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:44,270
hard drive that had to iTunes backups on

1143
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,799
there one for an iPad one for an iPhone

1144
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,940
and I'm like all right let me try

1145
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:48,740
four-digit you know they were both

1146
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,630
encrypted so I couldn't parse either one

1147
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,359
of them out like let me try four digit

1148
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,299
PIN try on the phone nothing trout in

1149
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,630
the iPad nothing all right let me try

1150
00:38:56,299 --> 00:39:01,730
six character phone nothing iPad boom

1151
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:04,279
I'm in sweet first thing I do when I

1152
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,660
open up that iPad is I start grabbing a

1153
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:07,160
list of all the passwords in it right

1154
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,629
what passwords if they used to log into

1155
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,129
Wi-Fi what passwords that they used to

1156
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,049
log into websites I grab all the

1157
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,910
passwords from that iPad I take that

1158
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,589
make it dictionary and that'll run that

1159
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,848
dictionary against the iPhone it was

1160
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:19,549
slow but I was still on that iPhone like

1161
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:20,900
10 minutes and so cracking that password

1162
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:23,720
it never would have happened but because

1163
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,309
people reuse passwords now we can take

1164
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,779
that and we can have some success and so

1165
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:28,520
once again we was talking about the

1166
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:29,990
crypto wallet I'm like just any other

1167
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,670
password you can rather them write

1168
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,109
anything from like an online service

1169
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,549
through this anything else you can get

1170
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:36,288
on that hard drive any ram dumps

1171
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:37,788
whatever you have but try to take some

1172
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:39,380
other passwords they use cuz there's a

1173
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:41,000
really really good chance that is a

1174
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,380
variant of that right and then we start

1175
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,630
mutating it with some of our hash cat

1176
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,190
rules whatever it is you want to do like

1177
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,589
I said I could sit here and play the

1178
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,210
password card all damn day long I'm not

1179
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:53,089
gonna play it I'm gonna play a different

1180
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:55,099
card I'm gonna play the practice card

1181
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:56,538
right and for the three of you in this

1182
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:59,180
room that are sports fans and get this

1183
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:02,359
joke thank you thank you very much Allen

1184
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,470
Iverson what do I mean by practice let's

1185
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,620
go take a look one more

1186
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:08,299
at the screen shot from that distributed

1187
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,279
denial of secret Sherwood dump of the

1188
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,330
the bank in the Caymans were supposedly

1189
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,930
all these shady Russians were doing

1190
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:17,690
money laundering and we see like I said

1191
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,960
domain controllers exchange servers file

1192
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,820
servers sequel databases

1193
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,620
you see forensics companies and you see

1194
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,720
II discoveries all the ediscovery

1195
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,890
companies all the time when they're

1196
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,330
testing their tools when they're doing

1197
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,859
case studies and publishing on these

1198
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:34,790
events what are they using right and

1199
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:36,980
wrong emails but Panama papers Panama

1200
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:39,200
papers super super common one that's

1201
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,460
breach data like no one has a problem

1202
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,049
with it because it's written off as just

1203
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,700
it was shady people doing shady things

1204
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,440
right once again like no one's really

1205
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,120
sticking up for the Nazis and saying you

1206
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,920
probably shouldn't be exposing that data

1207
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,180
and so people really don't have a

1208
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,560
problem with it when it's just kind of

1209
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,750
like read it off as like I said shady

1210
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,090
people doing shady things but if you're

1211
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,500
a forensics person working on forensics

1212
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,970
tools you're trying to practice you're

1213
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,220
trying to figure things out honestly

1214
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,959
sometimes this is like I said I'm not

1215
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,700
the morality police this is where to me

1216
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,770
the morality is the greatest that it is

1217
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,390
because honestly where else are you

1218
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:11,690
gonna get an exchange server to practice

1219
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,859
parsing you know see it start doing some

1220
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,150
of this style of work well they're

1221
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,710
sitting right there on the internet and

1222
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,300
if you're not gonna do anything when I

1223
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,920
start asking people about breach data

1224
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,360
it's usually pretty unanimous it's like

1225
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,800
I have no problem with that you're not

1226
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,000
doing anything good it's out there

1227
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,260
you're not going and grabbing at

1228
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,450
yourself so you're just doing it to try

1229
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,610
to protect your industry or do your job

1230
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,810
cool knock yourself out this is the one

1231
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,820
that makes people kind of wince a little

1232
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,799
bit alright because yeah it's out there

1233
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,570
you're not doing anything bad with it

1234
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,880
necessarily but still there are some

1235
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:40,130
very very sensitive data on there right

1236
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,380
and by very sensitive data you start

1237
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,520
looking at things like this when you

1238
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,610
have a folder called employee

1239
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,040
termination or salary changes right and

1240
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:50,210
you just kind of like wince like yeah

1241
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,350
yeah you can kind of use it to practice

1242
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,390
you can figure some of that things out

1243
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,860
and check it out but once again it kind

1244
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,900
of comes back home to the fact that this

1245
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,250
was a breach data set and there's some

1246
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,440
things in there that if you work for

1247
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,380
that organization you really really

1248
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,870
probably wish weren't out there it

1249
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,580
really really doesn't so I wanted it

1250
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,279
done done at about 10:45 and is now

1251
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,690
10:46 about perfect timing if you want

1252
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,100
to copy this presentation it's right

1253
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,260
there I put it up last night it is the

1254
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,610
latest updated version my twitter is

1255
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,770
there in the bottom right if you

1256
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,600
follow me on twitter feel free I'm gonna

1257
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:25,460
be honest with you it's about 80% tech

1258
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:27,049
about 15% alcohol and about 5% baseball

1259
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,820
if that guy right there so he's like the

1260
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,900
only baseball fan I know so we just go

1261
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,460
at it quite a bit

1262
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,350
so I probably got time for like one

1263
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,730
question if anyone wants one and other

1264
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,319
than that thank you very much and I

1265
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,490
appreciate it and should have a great

1266
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:42,710
afternoon hope you have a good day thank

1267
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:43,759
you I should also say - thank you - of

1268
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,470
East Side's Nova

1269
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,930
I've been do I think every one of these

1270
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:50,180
actually moved to DC like a week before

1271
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:52,549
the the first one and somehow I was able

1272
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,560
to get in on their generosity of getting

1273
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,090
me a ticket and so it's a it's really

1274
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,470
kind of an honor to speak here so they

1275
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,700
always do a great job it's always ends

1276
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,500
up being probably my favorite conference

1277
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,000
of the year so thank you for having me

1278
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,980
if you have any questions like I said

1279
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,420
come up me down I'm really really tough

1280
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,670
to miss man I'm probably like the next

1281
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,670
two tallest dude here so thank you

1282
