1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:07,170
the b-sides Nova 20/20 stream will begin

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,380
momentarily okay

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,910
hi everyone can everyone hear me yes

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:19,350
okay great all right we're gonna get

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:26,060
started here oh wait one second just

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,060
kidding I don't see one

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,720
okay while they're doing that I'm just

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,800
gonna get started so hi I'm Niki

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,079
Robinson I'm here to talk about

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,820
vulnerability chaining mostly as it

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,320
relates to vulnerability management and

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,320
from the remediation side of things

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:49,379
we're going to test this out here see if

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,030
I can figure this out okay great

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:56,040
all right so yep I'm Nikki so the reason

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,930
I got really interested in this topic I

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,730
started my doctorate a couple years ago

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,129
because I was really interested in how

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,530
low and medium vulnerabilities could be

20
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,100
used together to create a more severe

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,899
attack so I come from the IT world I did

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,770
Citrix for a number of years managing

23
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:16,140
virtual desktops then app servers

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:20,789
presentation farm 4.5 for many many many

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,800
years ago so anyway so I was managing

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:25,170
virtual desktops of managing servers and

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,259
the security team is like all right we

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,330
got to fix criticals and highs okay

29
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,439
great well so I started doing some

30
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,580
research into some medium

31
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,289
vulnerabilities and I was like hey

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,570
there's some you know some easy wins

33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,670
here we can apply some reg keys you know

34
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,250
we can change some group policies and

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,689
really lower the amount of mediums that

36
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,369
we have in our environment they're like

37
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,139
we don't have time for that just focus

38
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,970
on the critical some highs it's like

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,490
okay well it seems like kind of a

40
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,829
problem so anyway so I got interested in

41
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,229
Valle nura bility chaining and then how

42
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,939
do we kind of work on that when we're

43
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,470
thinking about remediating

44
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,470
vulnerabilities and prioritization

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,479
okay so what's vulnerability management

46
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,530
seems like you know it's pretty easy

47
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,419
right

48
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,870
it is not touch management those are

49
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,309
it's a component of it um I got I got

50
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,950
kind of tired of people coming up to me

51
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,120
and saying like oh well yeah you know

52
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,530
we're applying patches you know we're

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,180
doing vulnerability management I'm like

54
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,069
that is not a mature vulnerability

55
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,690
management program that's that's like

56
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,220
step one we got step one done that's

57
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,560
great okay what about everything else we

58
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,819
need to talk about secure configuration

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,980
what are our group policies look like

60
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,299
all of those different components go

61
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,280
into vulnerability management it's not

62
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,840
just applying a patch and I'm going to

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,459
talk as we go through the slides about

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,920
Spectre meltdown it's one of my favorite

65
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,269
things to talk about because it has many

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,100
of those components it's not just a

67
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,739
patch there's also registry keys drivers

68
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,560
all of those things so we need to

69
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:51,920
identify our vulnerabilities this is a

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,840
challenge mostly because some of our

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,970
hosts may be our servers we can't see

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,530
them we don't know about them so maybe

73
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,810
we're not even finding them that

74
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,360
definitely adds complexity when we're

75
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,340
trying to resolve vulnerabilities we

76
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,290
need to classify them so are we just

77
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,489
looking at vulnerability scoring you

78
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,429
know how much here is our vulnerability

79
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,680
program are we actually looking at how

80
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,989
are they exploitable all of those other

81
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,640
factors and then of course remediation

82
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,739
are we actually remediating them

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
effectively did we apply the patch in

84
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,010
you know our IT guys said yeah we

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,359
applied the patch it's good to go and

86
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,608
then you go and scan and you're like you

87
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:27,799
didn't actually apply the patch I I've

88
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:30,079
had many times where you know the IT guy

89
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,060
comes in and says okay I applied the

90
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,359
patch run your skin again we're good to

91
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,430
go

92
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:35,989
I run the scan and I'm like oh actually

93
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,430
your file version is still saying that

94
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,690
you didn't apply a patch he's like well

95
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,790
yeah I tried to apply the patch and it

96
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,870
said it wasn't applicable

97
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,858
well then you didn't apply the patch it

98
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,930
wasn't the right patch so in the

99
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,250
mitigate so we need to make sure we have

100
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,870
an accurate discovery of all where our

101
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,100
vulnerabilities because if we don't how

102
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,600
are we going to actually remediating

103
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,579
effectively if we don't know what we're

104
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,870
remediating that we could be looking in

105
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,299
the wrong direction and not actually

106
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,760
doing what we're supposed to be doing

107
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,620
how to prioritize so this is a big deal

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,390
if you're in the government space you

109
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,430
have to prioritize criticals and highs

110
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,510
maybe you have reporting requirements

111
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,190
maybe you have things that you have to

112
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,530
worry about specifically for criticals

113
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,140
and highs so that could be part of your

114
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,389
prioritization effort

115
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,709
systems affected versus impact that's

116
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,880
definitely an important part when we're

117
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,709
talking about maturity of the

118
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,200
vulnerability program you might have

119
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,660
four thousand systems affected but is

120
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,430
the vulnerability exploitable is it easy

121
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,680
to fix is it difficult could it break

122
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,760
our systems so all of those things have

123
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,100
to be thought about when we're looking

124
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,650
at vulnerability management and a

125
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,720
continuous monitoring program I know I

126
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,280
see it all the time where you know

127
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,690
people thinks that they've you know

128
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,669
we've remediate a vulnerability we've

129
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,139
got this fixed and then I run a scan

130
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,419
again and then it's showing up again

131
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,250
well because the baseline wasn't patched

132
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,289
so maybe they rolled out a hundred

133
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,070
desktops that aren't patched and here we

134
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,600
go we've got a hundred new

135
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,210
vulnerabilities that should have been

136
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,990
patched already okay so scoring metrics

137
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,599
so again when we're talking about

138
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,150
maturity you were looking at you know a

139
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,190
CVS score that gives us a good idea of

140
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,679
kind of how important that vulnerability

141
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,090
is but that's not the only thing you

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,070
know it's meant to kind of give you an

143
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,729
initial score to help you figure out how

144
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,800
to remediate that vulnerability not just

145
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:21,650
to score how valuable is the asset so

146
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,120
let's say I've got one server and it is

147
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,830
super critical to my business

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,780
hopefully you have to hopefully you have

149
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,490
of a hive availability but there are

150
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,090
plenty of places that maybe only have

151
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,380
one so how valuable is that asset am I

152
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,239
going to leave a critical vulnerability

153
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,039
on this one asset and fix these two

154
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,479
hundred other workstations maybe I'm

155
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,620
going to focus on this server first and

156
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,560
make sure that's fixed first before I

157
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,660
focus on my workstations what is the

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,100
likelihood is it I mean are they really

159
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,020
gonna attack us using this one

160
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,400
vulnerability or might they use this

161
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,320
exploitable vulnerability that's a

162
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,770
medium or low before they would use this

163
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,210
critical and who's targeting us I'm

164
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,340
going to talk a little bit more as we go

165
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,599
through about threat Intel and how it

166
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,190
can really help to mature a

167
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,340
vulnerability management program so

168
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,600
heatmaps

169
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,429
there are a lot of great tools out there

170
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,830
that don't just do vulnerability scoring

171
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,200
but they also provide like dashboards so

172
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,820
you can actually see you know you can

173
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,620
input hey these are my valuable assets

174
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,360
these are the most critical things to me

175
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,950
and that'll help you figure out and

176
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,930
prioritize which vulnerabilities you

177
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,430
should fix first because at the end of

178
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,890
the day we can't fix everything we can

179
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,760
try but with so many patches and

180
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,780
vulnerabilities released all the time

181
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,840
just kind of have to pick what's most

182
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,090
critical and fix those first and too

183
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,340
much information again I'm going to talk

184
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,859
a little bit as we go through about

185
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,419
additional complexity when it comes to

186
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,700
remediating vulnerabilities especially

187
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,020
if you have a ton of different products

188
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,450
in your environment you know you've got

189
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,940
let's say five different versions of

190
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,590
Windows server OS well you have to apply

191
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,360
patches for each one of those levels of

192
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,349
OS if you only have one that makes

193
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,350
things a lot more simple

194
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,500
okay so typical patch management

195
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,110
like I mentioned remediation deadlines

196
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,290
you know you might have 30 days for

197
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,200
critical 64 medium 94 low depending on

198
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,060
what you're if you have federal

199
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,330
regulations or you have something else

200
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,890
that you're looking at and then it's

201
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,750
going to depend on your small business

202
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,270
versus large organizations you know if

203
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,590
you have a one person IT shop patch

204
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,080
management's gonna look a lot different

205
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,780
than if you have a team of 30 so it's

206
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,859
really about prioritizing what's most

207
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,840
important first so of course you know in

208
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,330
a lot of places criticals in highs first

209
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,190
so why aren't we looking at mediums and

210
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,380
lows why aren't we looking at how you

211
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,020
know they could be used together to

212
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,940
create a critical attack you could take

213
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,070
two or three mediums or two or three

214
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,850
lows and mediums put them together and

215
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,800
create a critical attack and of course

216
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,270
end of life legacy I've actually heard a

217
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,280
couple presenters talk about it today

218
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,109
it's a it's a problem or else we

219
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,969
wouldn't be talking about it there's

220
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,530
plenty of end-of-life legacy

221
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,380
applications out there that people still

222
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,479
need I see Java six all the time and it

223
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,980
kills me but people need it you know

224
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,490
because they they can upgrade or they

225
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,950
won't upgrade so how do we fix those

226
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,370
things if we can't remediate Java 6 do

227
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,800
we segment it what do we need to do Oh

228
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,880
so this use case here multiple

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,820
applications would serve the same

230
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,040
function so I've seen this time and time

231
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,840
again so imagine a an umbrella

232
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,580
organization they've got maybe five or

233
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,289
six organizations kind of underneath

234
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,400
them they all have their own purchasing

235
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,860
requirements they all have their own

236
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,228
people who want their own software so

237
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,360
you end up with five different types of

238
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,370
finance software maybe all different

239
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,599
levels of versions maybe they're using

240
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,159
them differently and

241
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,899
maybe you only have one IT team that's

242
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,209
servicing them all so you've got to push

243
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:48,250
push different patches or maybe you

244
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,170
can't patch a certain date or a time

245
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,329
because they have requirements it just

246
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,870
adds all this complexity to your patch

247
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:58,540
management program

248
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,550
okay so vulnerability chaining this is

249
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,990
something that hackers know about this

250
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,529
is something that pen testers use every

251
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:08,889
day using multiple vulnerabilities in

252
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,899
sync to create a more critical attack to

253
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,910
steal those credentials to get into

254
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,250
those systems and to keep getting into

255
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,959
those systems creating backdoors all of

256
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,029
those things so why aren't we doing that

257
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,680
from the remediation side why aren't we

258
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:23,110
looking at vulnerabilities in

259
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,579
combination while we're trying to

260
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,930
remediate them that would help us to

261
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,719
prioritize things I think a little

262
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:32,258
easier hacker sophistication is

263
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,350
increasing so when I started on helpdesk

264
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:36,790
it was about 12 years ago I will never

265
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,069
forget it so it was like my first two

266
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,750
weeks the director of HR called me and

267
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:43,029
he was like man I'm seeing all these

268
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,410
popups on my desk I don't know what

269
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:45,880
happened I was like all right hold on

270
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,050
I'll be right there so I get over there

271
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,019
and of course it was just like your

272
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,420
typical you know click where so or

273
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:53,319
adware so you know unplug from the

274
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,880
network and it was like well what

275
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:56,889
happened he's like well you know I got

276
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,199
this email from Amazon and it said that

277
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:01,029
my order was delayed and you know I just

278
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,819
I had to click on it like we didn't have

279
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,670
to click on it but you did so anyway so

280
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:08,079
you know sophistication used to be like

281
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,639
that or it didn't used to be as

282
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,410
sophisticated you know it was just

283
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,420
phishing attacks and some pretty

284
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,370
harmless adware now we've got business

285
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,279
email compromised you know where they're

286
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,990
actually compromising accounts so the

287
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,670
sophistication is constantly increasing

288
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,290
for the hackers so we need to increase

289
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,800
that sophistication or vulnerability

290
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,149
management programs vulnerability

291
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,209
training allows that actors to move

292
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:32,920
stealthily throughout the network

293
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:35,920
they're able to identify and use

294
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,420
peripheral weaknesses and as you'll see

295
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,389
I have a couple of examples that I want

296
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,769
to go through you'll see how low low

297
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,750
vulnerabilities can actually be

298
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:46,050
exploitable and used in some of these

299
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,050
scenarios

300
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,080
okay so it's the first one I want to

301
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:57,449
talk about so this vulnerability came

302
00:10:52,080 --> 00:11:01,170
out in 2016 so this is a resource access

303
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,730
bypass which just means that you know

304
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,339
they can get through the network and get

305
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,410
access to files and change the security

306
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,329
on those files to be able to gain access

307
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,300
to files that maybe they shouldn't have

308
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:16,290
had access to so this was scored as a

309
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,969
4-2 as a low exploits are available for

310
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,709
it

311
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,660
and one other thing I wanted to mention

312
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:24,569
that I don't know that people always

313
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,490
think about but these CVEs are updated

314
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,130
all the time as people get more

315
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,540
information as they find out you know

316
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,600
maybe it wasn't exploitable one day

317
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,069
maybe a year from now it is so these

318
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,769
vulnerabilities are updated all the time

319
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,019
so if we're ignoring Lowe's for four

320
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,310
years this could be an exploitable

321
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,370
vulnerabilities sitting on your network

322
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,260
so it's important to take a look at

323
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,350
those Lowe's and mediums and hopefully

324
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,029
remediates some of them oh and I wanted

325
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,410
to mention this one was specifically for

326
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:56,160
endpoint software okay so this one like

327
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,069
I said we're going to talk about

328
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,610
spectrum out down a little bit this was

329
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,760
one from 2019 side channel attack part

330
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:08,430
of Spectre this was published in 2019

331
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,770
there are exploits available this one

332
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,589
was ranked even lower at a 3.6 even

333
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,449
though their exploits available so it's

334
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,079
just another great example this is an OS

335
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:21,779
kernel update from 2019

336
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:25,219
so it's possible have patched it but if

337
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,220
it's a low maybe they haven't

338
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,120
okay so I I have to training examples

339
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,250
that I want to talk about I'm sure

340
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,520
anyone who's on a red team probably

341
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,230
familiar with at least some of these

342
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,650
some of these chained examples okay so

343
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,740
for the first one so you've got a

344
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,270
publicly available developer web page

345
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,380
hopefully you don't but you might you

346
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,000
know maybe you got a dev out there

347
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,080
that's like you know what I just I need

348
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,760
to use this from home maybe I'm gonna

349
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,880
have this publicly available nobody will

350
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,569
know so you've got a cross-site

351
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,040
scripting on there well you know maybe

352
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,170
maybe they thought it was only available

353
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,839
to one person but someone got access to

354
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:09,420
it they were able to use the cross-site

355
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,590
scripting and let's say that they so

356
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,410
they're able to steal the credentials

357
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,880
they're able to modify the page with the

358
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,250
malicious script so let's say maybe they

359
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,480
drop some malware on there whatever so

360
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,670
the next time that dev goes on there

361
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,930
maybe they have access to your network I

362
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,120
mean there's a million different ways

363
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,010
that they could get in from there so I

364
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,370
think it's important to bring up a lot

365
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:33,300
like I said one of these examples here

366
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:36,150
and this one I really like so you've got

367
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:40,770
a login logout CSRF I mean hopefully you

368
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:42,720
don't but someone did so the CSRF you're

369
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,730
going to take over the user account so

370
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,800
you make the user log out of the

371
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,440
legitimate system get them to log into

372
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,349
the attacker system so what starts with

373
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,610
one user what starts with a you know

374
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,230
across site scripting on one user

375
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,990
account actually becomes cross-site

376
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,240
scripting across the entire network and

377
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,100
that's a pretty big deal that's not a

378
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,270
good thing because then they could just

379
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,160
steal the credentials of anyone that

380
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,050
they wanted and you know in a business

381
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,959
email compromised situation they may be

382
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,209
targeting the CEO they may not actually

383
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,740
you know be interested in anybody else's

384
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,840
accounts they may just want the CEOs

385
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,840
account to conduct wire transfers

386
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:25,839
okay so additional complexity so when

387
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:29,800
we're talking about you know mediums and

388
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,899
lows being exploitable it's not the only

389
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,029
problem we're also seeing a lot more

390
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:37,750
vulnerabilities classified as critical

391
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:39,670
as and highs so not only do we have to

392
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,380
also worry about mediums and lows but a

393
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,079
lot more vulnerabilities are being

394
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,970
classified higher recorded future found

395
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,819
that vulnerabilities and this is just

396
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,970
over one week 62% were classified as

397
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,970
high 36% were classified as critical now

398
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,500
depending on how complex your network is

399
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,820
that's a big problem you know how many

400
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,529
that means you know if you've got

401
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,269
reporting requirements for 30 days to

402
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:03,160
fix things and you've got a hundred new

403
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:06,490
criticals in a month on your system

404
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,350
that's pretty hard to keep up with so it

405
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,029
just it adds that additional complexity

406
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,620
when we're talking about vulnerability

407
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:13,570
or remediation and trying to get those

408
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,220
mediums and lows fixed because if you

409
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,110
have more criticals and highs constantly

410
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:22,149
piling up you may not have time to get

411
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:26,680
to those lows and medians okay so this

412
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:31,480
is probably my favorite topic so January

413
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:33,310
2017 2017 spectrum spectrum meltdown was

414
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,970
released you know the first patches came

415
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:41,140
out from Windows but it wasn't just

416
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:43,089
patches it was also drivers registry

417
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,670
keys I've been in several environments

418
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:48,190
where I've seen people say oh yeah we

419
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,810
patched vector meltdown and then I see

420
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,310
three or four vulnerabilities associated

421
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,199
with them because the registry keys

422
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,910
weren't added or the registry keys were

423
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,959
added and they had the wrong setting so

424
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,790
they put a zero where they were supposed

425
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:02,469
to put a three so you didn't actually

426
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,699
remediated so anyway so I think specter

427
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,019
meltdown is really important

428
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,120
mostly because this one is still

429
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,010
constantly evolving but people don't

430
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,260
think about it you know so I was in an

431
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,390
environment let's see about a year year

432
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,800
and a half ago and so they said we were

433
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,120
mediated it's not a problem

434
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,439
I said well you didn't fix these

435
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,240
registry keys and they're like yes we

436
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,690
did I was like no and I can show you

437
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,579
didn't but all that takes time to show

438
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,660
people that well no actually you have to

439
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,880
do the setting you have to do this thing

440
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,290
and this is constantly evolving so

441
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,640
there's new patches released all the

442
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,279
time there's new drivers released all

443
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,459
the time

444
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,009
that's just for this one thing of course

445
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:41,209
it affects the processor Intel

446
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:42,589
processors and the important thing is

447
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,359
that any of the vulnerabilities

448
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,660
associated with this could be classified

449
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,059
as a critical high medium or low so as I

450
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,809
showed in one of the previous slides

451
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:52,639
vulnerabilities associated with this

452
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:59,029
even though they're exploitable might be

453
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:04,069
shown as a low okay so adding threat

454
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:07,130
intelligence I think this is a really

455
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:09,579
important piece to add maturity to your

456
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,260
vulnerability management practice

457
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:13,280
because remediation becomes really tough

458
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,179
you know when you're trying to figure

459
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,829
out how should I prioritize things you

460
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:20,809
know adding threat Intel knowing who's

461
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,639
actually interested in your systems I

462
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:24,740
think can really help in that

463
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,909
remediation process because if you just

464
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,220
don't even know who's targeting

465
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:31,039
you know if I'm a financial institution

466
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,299
versus a local government different

467
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,220
people are going to be targeting me for

468
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,860
different information so really knowing

469
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,409
that information knowing who's actually

470
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,000
after you what tools they have what

471
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:43,220
malware they might be using different

472
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,570
variants that's all going to help to

473
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,100
mature the vulnerability management

474
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,309
program and help you focus on the really

475
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,668
important things

476
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:54,830
oh and provides action-oriented advice I

477
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:56,120
think that's a nice term for management

478
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,340
when you're trying to get across why

479
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,020
it's important to add threat Intel into

480
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:04,459
your into your practices using words

481
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:07,129
like this so like oh that sounds good so

482
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,630
I bring up leadership because this is

483
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,880
sometimes a hard sell to take to our

484
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,440
management and say you know I really

485
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,880
want to focus on low vulnerabilities

486
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,470
like why why would you want to do that I

487
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,970
have a really good couple of years ago

488
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:24,559
so I went to my CIO and I said listen

489
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,270
we've got the criticals and highs under

490
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,668
control we really need to start focusing

491
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,990
our resources on mediums and lows and he

492
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,909
was like I don't care about mediums and

493
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,190
lows I need a report on critical sin

494
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:36,710
highs that's what I'm worried about okay

495
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,940
well a couple weeks later he said I want

496
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,039
to see the top 10 exploitable

497
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,899
vulnerabilities in our environment no

498
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,908
problem they were all mediums and lows

499
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:48,709
and he was like well we need to fix the

500
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:49,999
we do you're right I mean I told you

501
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,070
that a couple weeks ago but yes we did

502
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:54,980
absolutely yep let's do that

503
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,539
so I think taking this information and

504
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,429
bundling it in a way that our leadership

505
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:59,990
can understand can actually help us to

506
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:04,269
mature the vulnerability management

507
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:06,499
program so top 10 vulnerable hosts I

508
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,629
found that to be really effective too

509
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:10,519
especially if they can see like the same

510
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:12,259
ten workstations over and over again

511
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,320
they're like why are these people plug

512
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:17,240
in their laptops in I don't know we

513
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,090
should cut them off the network so it

514
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,519
kind of helps give you a case for you

515
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,049
know hey these these ten laptops are

516
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,549
constantly problem let's get them off

517
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:28,158
the network or let's reimagine it's just

518
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:31,009
completely reimagine top five

519
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,929
vulnerabilities so top fives tops hence

520
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:35,320
I think those are super actionable

521
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:37,399
because they're little chunks of things

522
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,009
instead of saying you know hey I've got

523
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:41,658
400 workstations that we can't reach and

524
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:44,029
I don't you know I can't patch them I

525
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:45,139
can't do this that starting with 10 you

526
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:47,869
know you can start to really whittle

527
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:50,149
those vulnerabilities down top 5

528
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:52,070
vulnerabilities with most infected hosts

529
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,689
I mean it just helps to give context to

530
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,428
the data that you're giving to

531
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,929
leadership and helping them understand

532
00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:00,200
what the problem is and why it's a

533
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:02,059
problem I always say 5 page maximum on

534
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,649
PDFs it really should be like 3 pages I

535
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:06,440
don't think anybody even really wants to

536
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:09,139
read five pages and then showing

537
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,570
vulnerability trends so actually showing

538
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:13,580
when you're being really effective so if

539
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,080
you can show hey we had these top 10

540
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,059
exploitable vulnerabilities in our

541
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,129
environment you know two weeks ago and

542
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,600
now those are gone to replace with new

543
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:22,428
vulnerabilities well it's a good thing

544
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,519
it means we remediated the old ones so

545
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:27,440
showing those vulnerability trends can

546
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,149
really help leadership understand kind

547
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,990
of what your goals are and that you're

548
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:31,989
actually achieving them

549
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:41,309
okay so final takeaways adding threat

550
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,809
intelligence and hopefully I've given

551
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,428
you a couple ways that you can fight to

552
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,420
add that it's your vulnerability

553
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,179
management program if you're not doing

554
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,470
it already

555
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:52,050
prioritizing exploitable vulnerabilities

556
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,820
no matter what the score is because if

557
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,040
you've gotten a good handle on criticals

558
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,360
and you're getting there with highs you

559
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,649
can start to make a case to start

560
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,189
working on those mediums and then

561
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:05,220
hopefully on those low vulnerabilities

562
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,660
automate patching this is a hard thing

563
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,050
for leadership to understand sometimes

564
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,010
especially if they've had a bad patch

565
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,960
you know you've had a bad Microsoft

566
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,400
patch or something go out and leadership

567
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,170
is like really scared of automated

568
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,059
patching but if you can show a

569
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,940
consistent practice where you can say

570
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,980
listen we automate these 10 servers to

571
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,870
get patched first monitor them for a

572
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,210
week if they're good patch everything

573
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,760
else or maybe not sequel or some stuff

574
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,300
like your data bases but getting a

575
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,879
chance to kind of again push that patch

576
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,440
management program forward so you can

577
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,860
just start knocking out vulnerabilities

578
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,559
a lot faster consider chaining attacks

579
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,969
and remediation efforts I think this is

580
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,910
really important for the defenders side

581
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,450
to just be aware that this can be done

582
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,559
because you can start to look at these

583
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,690
and you're looking at the way that pen

584
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,100
testers do the work and start to see how

585
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,450
are they getting in where are they

586
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,159
getting in which vulnerabilities are

587
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,510
they using to get in and kind of

588
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,960
starting there and that might help to

589
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,429
prioritize your efforts training the

590
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,970
defenders and the hacker methodologies

591
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:12,390
again super important and oh my gosh get

592
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,740
rid of vol software it's so hard I know

593
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,890
it's difficult because I've seen it in

594
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,260
so many places especially I've Adobe 11

595
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:21,980
going from Adobe 11 to Dobby DC seemed

596
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:25,640
to be a really really hard thing to do

597
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,620
but it's so crucial because they're so

598
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,760
exploitable usually and they're the

599
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,760
easiest ones to target

600
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:37,389
okay I think I have some time for

601
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,389
questions and comments

602
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:45,549
here we've addressed a lot of high and

603
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:48,468
critical vulnerabilities we found some

604
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:51,349
media importance and we fix them but

605
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:53,089
here are more and I can see especially

606
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:55,729
since we've only been focusing on my

607
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:57,739
critical or abilities that it will seem

608
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:59,719
to someone in the senior leadership

609
00:22:57,739 --> 00:23:01,129
position that we're putting all this

610
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:03,559
work in but they just keep coming

611
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:10,549
you have any thoughts on how to show the

612
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:13,879
value that ever yes so yes so the the

613
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:17,059
question was if you can see how can you

614
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:19,369
kind of show to leadership that you are

615
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,469
mitigating as many vulnerabilities kind

616
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:22,819
of instead of just showing like hey

617
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:25,999
there's new vulnerabilities all the time

618
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:28,789
so I think it's kind of a two-part thing

619
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:30,649
if you can show the trend of

620
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:32,539
vulnerabilities trending downward the

621
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:35,059
ones that you've patched and also the

622
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:37,839
patch is applied so hopefully you're

623
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:40,849
patching software you have a way to show

624
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,829
what we what we used to do is we would

625
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:44,479
take that chart showing vulnerabilities

626
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:46,819
going down and then also the number of

627
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:50,209
patches applied per system per month so

628
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:51,499
that would be you know 50,000 patches

629
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:53,629
applied a hundred thousand patches

630
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:55,369
applied and that really for executive

631
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:56,958
management was like oh my gosh you're

632
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:58,759
applying this many a month was like yeah

633
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:00,169
that's how many there are even if you

634
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:01,489
only have four thousand endpoints that's

635
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:03,889
how many patches were actually applying

636
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:05,989
per month so giving totals for those I

637
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:06,258
think helps if it answer your question

638
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:09,159
okay

639
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:09,159
any other questions

640
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:18,550
exploitable vulnerability so exploitable

641
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,260
means that there is an active exploit

642
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,600
out there in the wild someone might not

643
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,070
actually be using it yet but it is a

644
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,980
known exploit that someone could

645
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:36,520
actually go out and get that go in using

646
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:44,380
that vulnerability oh I see so do you

647
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:47,920
mean if their ranks the same so I would

648
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,450
say okay so the question was if you have

649
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,670
two exploitable vulnerabilities which

650
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,220
one is the the most vulnerable and it

651
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,110
depends on your environment because if I

652
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,040
have two systems with two exploitable

653
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:02,949
vulnerabilities and this server is you

654
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,659
know maybe it's backup server or

655
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,190
something you know maybe I'm not as

656
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,110
worried about it I'm not going to be as

657
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,640
worried about it as this critical server

658
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,020
you know that's hosting all my business

659
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,020
function of my business applications

660
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:28,900
right so so I will use the government

661
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,600
terminology that I'm familiar with so

662
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,310
five high valued assets so if I have a

663
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,689
high valued asset that is absolutely

664
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:38,020
going to be the thing that I focus on

665
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:40,120
the most so let's say so like if your

666
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,240
sequel database goes down that could be

667
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,040
really bad especially if it's hosting a

668
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,290
application or a you know public facing

669
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,780
or a user application so I would say

670
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:52,480
again it depends on what your

671
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:55,090
environment classifies as a high valued

672
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,300
asset you know if we were to lose this

673
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,379
data is our company going under okay

674
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,020
well then I'm going to worry about that

675
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,240
one first so again it's not just is it

676
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,580
exploitable but it's also how is it

677
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,360
exploitable is it being exploited in the

678
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:12,730
wild what server is it on so it's a lot

679
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,360
of different factors in there any other

680
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,590
questions yes so how do you recommend

681
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,959
for mitigating risk associated with

682
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,668
let us exalt we're looking at life stuff

683
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,830
that you have to keep around for your

684
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:27,710
admission requirements right so the the

685
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:31,340
question was how do you handle keeping

686
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:34,610
end of life software around when you

687
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,799
have to so network segmentation is a

688
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,379
great option if you can segment it away

689
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,120
from just everything else limiting the

690
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:44,120
amount of users that have access to it

691
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,850
and then limiting admin rights to that

692
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,768
machine that application so trying to

693
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,998
keep it as separate as possible from any

694
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:50,509
of the other systems is probably the way

695
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:54,740
I'd go

696
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:56,210
okay sure any other questions nope okay

697
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,890
I'm good thank you guys very much I

698
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,939
appreciate it

699
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,939
[Applause]

700
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,919
you
