1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:17,400
the b-sides Nova 20/20 stream will begin

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:26,160
momentarily the b-sides Nova 20/20

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:30,470
stream will begin momentarily the

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,470
b-sides Nova 20/20 stresses

5
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:38,620
Audio check can y'all hear me in the

6
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:57,579
back

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:59,809
alright alright

8
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:02,030
welcome to voight-komp for email

9
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,729
addresses quantifying email address

10
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,420
reputation to identify spearfishing and

11
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:09,320
fraud

12
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,420
I'm Josh kam Jew before we begin real

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,419
quick we're gonna do a live demo at the

14
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,570
end of this where we look up email

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,030
addresses submitted by you guys and

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,610
we're gonna dig into the the reputation

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,880
of those addresses and discuss that so I

18
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,610
have my Twitter handle up here if you

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,100
want just hit me with the DM with an

20
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,110
email address don't send me anything

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,548
sketchy or like that you don't want up

22
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,640
on the big screen because it's going to

23
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:41,270
go up on a big screen and we'll do that

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,999
at the end so while we do that we'll get

25
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,119
some submissions in who has heard of

26
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:53,270
email rep

27
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:57,469
okay who has used email rep okay who has

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,829
coronavirus okay get this guy out of

29
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:03,609
here

30
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:03,609
get this guy out all right cool

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,739
does anybody not know has anybody not

32
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:19,730
seen Blade Runner or does not know what

33
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:22,549
a void comp test is okay okay so a void

34
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:26,018
comp test is a test used to determine

35
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:29,599
whether an individual is a human or a

36
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:32,239
replicant or effectively a robot and so

37
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,940
we have taken that analogy and we've

38
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,549
applied it to email addresses so email

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,640
rep is a service that we built it's a

40
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:43,579
free API to determine whether an email

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,500
address is fake or legit so that's the

42
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:48,560
analogy and that's what we're going with

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,340
today so some quick background so I'm

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,799
the founder and CEO of sublime security

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,650
in the past I've done mostly a bunch of

46
00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:02,000
government work bunch of pen testing

47
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,040
spent some time at NIST went to UMD for

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,170
computer science did martial arts

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:11,810
growing up my whole life and played a

50
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:14,119
lot of halo growing up too so quick

51
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,250
outline we're gonna discuss the

52
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,919
background and motivation for building

53
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,169
this service why is important to us

54
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,209
that'll be quick we'll discuss what

55
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,590
email reputation is and why it's

56
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,019
important why you might care about it

57
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,459
and then we'll do a technical deep dive

58
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,730
so this is where we'll spend most of our

59
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,069
time and our goal here is to basically

60
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,810
give you the tools to rebuild this

61
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:38,388
service from the ground up if you want

62
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,970
to so discuss how we built it all the

63
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:44,099
inputs and everything like that

64
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,109
we'll discuss some of our future work

65
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,638
and we'll do a live demo like I said

66
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:52,170
hopefully we get some submissions so

67
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,219
let's talk about our motivation for this

68
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:58,950
so at sublime we're building an open

69
00:03:55,219 --> 00:04:00,689
adoptable email security platform so we

70
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,268
have a query language that lets you

71
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:05,040
define attacker behavior whenever a

72
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,530
message comes into your environment we

73
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,230
are tokenizing it we're creating a data

74
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,629
model and we're enriching it we're using

75
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,060
enrichments like domain enrichments

76
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:17,969
blacklist reputation IP address

77
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,978
reputation file reputation malware

78
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,590
scanning services and we asked ourselves

79
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,960
what about email addresses why isn't

80
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:29,940
anybody doing anything for email

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,280
addresses pnto once said when someone's

82
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,770
accused of a crime you look at the

83
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,559
person who committed the crime their

84
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,370
prior history who they are not just the

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,389
crime itself

86
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,250
so why in email security do we only are

87
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,169
we only looking at the message we're not

88
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,210
looking at the history of the sender and

89
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:51,740
so that's that's the motivation here is

90
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:57,359
why aren't we looking at the sender more

91
00:04:51,740 --> 00:05:01,229
so what is email rep email represent is

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,650
a service free API to query email

93
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:06,409
reputation and report bad behavior so we

94
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,669
have a sample output here on the right

95
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:12,780
it's pretty pretty simple pretty

96
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:15,630
straightforward and we will go through

97
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,570
like all these different things here in

98
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,719
the output and and dig into exactly how

99
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,170
we determine these things and why

100
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,520
they're important

101
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,970
so at this point you're probably asking

102
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,370
yourselves what is reputation so we'll

103
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,220
define reputation it's the overall

104
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,370
quality or character as seen or judged

105
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:43,110
by people in general the overall quality

106
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:46,650
or character okay so what is email

107
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,580
reputation it's the overall quality or

108
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:53,880
character of an email address as seen or

109
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:59,729
judged by internet history and activity

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:02,430
so we'll dig into that we have four

111
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:06,680
different reputation levels here we have

112
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:10,170
no reputation ranging from none to high

113
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,240
if you have no reputation generally

114
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,910
means you're risky we can't associate

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,340
you with a real person it doesn't mean

116
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,690
that you're bad just want to be clear

117
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,729
about that it means that we cannot

118
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,000
definitively say anything about you

119
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,680
being good and then we have you know low

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,780
medium and when you get too high that

121
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,110
means that you we've seen a lot of good

122
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,270
behavior a lot of good history and no

123
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,460
bad history or at least no bad recent

124
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,450
history and we'll talk about the

125
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,919
distinction there and why that's

126
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:42,529
important too

127
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:45,769
so why now why why does this matter now

128
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,479
so I don't have to tell you guys that

129
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:50,839
fishing is a problem it's a big

130
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:54,169
problem it's on the rise fishing defense

131
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:57,139
is hard we are building an email

132
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:59,109
security platform and attackers are

133
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:03,229
getting more sophisticated they're

134
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,509
passing SPF D Kim D mark and legit

135
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:08,599
companies are failing these things and

136
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:12,649
so we it's difficult to rely on these

137
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:15,069
technologies themselves to to protect us

138
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:17,209
so we're looking for new ways to

139
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,479
algorithmically determine whether a

140
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:21,949
message is phishing or not and for free

141
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,089
email providers there is no domain

142
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:28,339
reputation to go off of so that's just

143
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:29,889
another lack of you know input that you

144
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:35,539
have when when making a determination

145
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:38,119
for whether something's a fish or not so

146
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:40,039
we'll discuss there's two primary use

147
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:41,809
cases and in the phishing defense space

148
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,699
that we're going to talk about that this

149
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:45,439
talk is heavily focused on the phishing

150
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:50,659
defense application of email reputation

151
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:52,519
and the first use case is when new email

152
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:55,789
addresses are created to conduct a

153
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:58,009
campaign this is the use case that email

154
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:00,378
rep is really good at there are a

155
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:02,749
variety of ways that a variety of

156
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,779
reasons why this may happen if you're an

157
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:08,509
attacker you may be creating a target

158
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:10,579
specific email address you may be you

159
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,499
know impersonating an executive there

160
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:14,300
you may be just creating a new email

161
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:17,749
address so that there's no association

162
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,029
between your prior campaigns email rep

163
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:22,729
is really good at this because we have

164
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:24,979
all this data about history and when you

165
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:27,829
create a new email in a new email

166
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:30,409
address there is no history so we're

167
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:33,169
really good at the API is really good at

168
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:35,080
knowing when things are risky with new

169
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,708
email addresses

170
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:45,000
so let's do let's do a little

171
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:49,899
interactive exercise here we have three

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,010
email addresses up on the screen and I'm

173
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:54,970
going to go through each one of these

174
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:58,870
and let me know which one of these you

175
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,570
think is my real email address so who

176
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,360
thinks the first the top one

177
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:08,140
Josh kam jus ninety at gmail.com is my

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,110
real email all right

179
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,779
maybe like a quarter of the room who

180
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:18,790
thinks the middle one is my real email

181
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:22,269
address Josh can do at gmail.com alright

182
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:26,709
and that's about half the room and the

183
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:30,000
last one Joshua can do at gmail.com okay

184
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,000
that's like about a quarter all right

185
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:40,540
there you go nice all right okay show

186
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:43,930
hands again first one all right sorry to

187
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:47,410
say that you are wrong this is not my

188
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:50,770
real email address this email address is

189
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,390
risky it's suspicious we have not

190
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,899
observed this email address on the

191
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,020
Internet

192
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:58,390
it is from a free provider and it has no

193
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,310
profiles on major services like LinkedIn

194
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,310
Facebook in iCloud

195
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:12,350
we've never seen it before who thought

196
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:17,180
the second one alright you are also

197
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:22,700
wrong this email address is also risky

198
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:29,500
same reason and who thought the third

199
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,500
one alright you are also wrong

200
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,959
none of these are my real email this

201
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,540
one's not even deliverable all right

202
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:42,080
and so like the point of this right is

203
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,670
it's really hard and like just by

204
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,290
looking at an email address this is a

205
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:52,280
free provider right so what was that

206
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:54,199
that means you want yeah yes so like

207
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,600
free email provider we don't have much

208
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,540
to go off of you know by just by looking

209
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,970
at it and so that's yeah that's the

210
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,240
point of this exercise this is my real

211
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:09,470
email address drastically different

212
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,300
response hi reputation it's been seen in

213
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,420
17 reputable sources

214
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,240
it has profiles on sites like Twitter

215
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:20,930
Flickr and Spotify it's been seen in

216
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,900
data breaches from 2012 but not since

217
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,770
May of 2019 and we've observed no

218
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,770
malicious activity

219
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:39,560
all right use case number two so this

220
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,500
use case is a lot more difficult this is

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,199
when an email address has been taken

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,820
over so it's a legitimate email address

223
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,580
it's been taken over by an attacker and

224
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,350
it's being used for malicious purposes

225
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,250
the reason this is more difficult is

226
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:58,490
because it's a high reputation email and

227
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,250
it is being used maliciously temporally

228
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,010
in a specific point in time that user

229
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,810
may get their you know retrieved their

230
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,090
credentials or like recover the account

231
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,979
or whatever so it's it's a lot more

232
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:13,490
difficult to know temporally when

233
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,380
something is bad we'll talk about how

234
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,040
we're addressing this through the

235
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:22,490
community reporting and like all these

236
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,449
other different ways and so we'll get to

237
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,560
that all right technical deep dive so

238
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:35,300
this is this is the meet at the top

239
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:37,849
okay inputs positive inputs social media

240
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,160
profiles we talked about in my with my

241
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,740
email we had twitter linkedin all those

242
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,589
other ones business-related profiles

243
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,520
like linkedin domain age so if it's not

244
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:52,450
a free email provider and it's a custom

245
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,610
you know domain how old is it

246
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:58,730
attackers spin up domains before for

247
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:02,750
conducting new campaigns is it aged data

248
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:05,030
breaches so we use data historical data

249
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:09,440
breaches as a positive source of

250
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:11,120
reputation why because that most likely

251
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,030
means that you're a legitimate person

252
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,120
most people in this room have been in a

253
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,250
data breach at some point in time and as

254
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,580
long as that data breach is not recent

255
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:25,310
then we use that as a positive source of

256
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,710
reputation same thing with credential

257
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,989
weeks these this is history right so

258
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,710
like this is just kind of proving that

259
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,710
you're a real person

260
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,949
domain reputation there are lots of like

261
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:39,149
domain reputation providers lots of

262
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,370
inputs that go into this we'll break

263
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,680
that down in associations with high

264
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,020
reputation so a lot of times even if

265
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,699
that account specifically is not on

266
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,199
various services we might be able to

267
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,970
draw relationships between other

268
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,070
accounts based off of various

269
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,420
information and so we'll discuss how we

270
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,279
do that negative inputs phishing and

271
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:03,959
fraud has this email address sent any

272
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:06,300
phishing emails spam logon login form

273
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,170
spam like that's pretty common for for

274
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:13,829
spammers has anyone in the community

275
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:16,560
reported that email address phishing

276
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,529
kits it has it have we seen it as part

277
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,599
of a fishing kit at any point in time

278
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:24,959
either as the threat actor or or

279
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,709
compromised in any way domain age so

280
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,719
recency so the opposite of the positive

281
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:33,300
input if it's like in the last 30 days

282
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,940
or 60 days that might be a negative

283
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,829
input data breaches recent like was

284
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,720
there a data breach yesterday was it you

285
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:41,000
know just compromised do we think same

286
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,320
thing with credential leaks

287
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,520
deliverability if it's not deliverable

288
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,980
and whether it's spoof able or not and

289
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:55,740
let we'll break down now each one of

290
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:58,290
these categories so data breaches there

291
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,880
is no sort sort äj-- of data breach

292
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:06,000
providers we use a few of these and we

293
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,829
also have our own sources for this we

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,570
use have I been pwned heavily we love

295
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:11,569
Troy hunt and have I been pwned

296
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,360
if you guys are like interested in any

297
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,460
of this info just I'll that's the slides

298
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:24,250
will be posted or just hit me up and we

299
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:26,940
can send all this to you who is so we

300
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,110
use who is obviously for domain age

301
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,740
there are some lessons here if you want

302
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:37,150
to roll this yourself there you will get

303
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:41,430
rate limited we use a who is XML API we

304
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:46,420
use hue we use who is XML API for this

305
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:48,760
there I if anybody has any better

306
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:55,150
alternatives let me know we're

307
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:58,980
definitely open to alternatives there we

308
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,760
use DNS heavily so is it a valid domain

309
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,310
you'd be surprised

310
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,100
like sometimes we don't even have a

311
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,469
valid domain sometimes there's no MX

312
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,120
record you'd also be surprised that

313
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,340
people are sending spam phishing

314
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,430
messages without MX records like that's

315
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:18,520
immediately sign of suspicion is there

316
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,810
SPF records D mark records do we think

317
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,790
that this is spoof able in any way and

318
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:28,089
we're looking at text records for a lot

319
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,670
of interesting things do we see any esos

320
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,980
like any high reputation type things

321
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,860
that like services that might cost money

322
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,890
in DNS records in their text records

323
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,660
like MailChimp or you know like sang

324
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,160
grid or all these like these things that

325
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:48,839
cost money that attackers are less

326
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:52,870
likely to do SMTP so we use SMTP for

327
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:55,420
deliverability a gmail account that is

328
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,940
not deliverable is suspicious and the

329
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,329
reason is that gmail will actually tell

330
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:04,840
you whether in an email address exists

331
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,550
on their site or not in the next slide

332
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,849
we'll discuss exactly how you can do

333
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,530
that and how you can roll that yourself

334
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,359
we currently use a provider for this we

335
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,960
use kickbox

336
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:18,250
and the reason is that there's just a

337
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,290
lot of challenges in rolling your own

338
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,959
eventually it will put more time and

339
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,190
effort into like fully supporting our

340
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,680
own here to reduce our costs

341
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:31,150
so if you wanted to roll your own this

342
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,230
is how you would do it this is how you

343
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:37,330
would determine deliverability for a

344
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:40,420
gmail address or this is the same

345
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:44,169
process for all all addresses really so

346
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,510
first thing is we need the MX record so

347
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,300
we're gonna pull the MX record for

348
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:53,650
sublime security comm we can see that

349
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,720
the that the MX record is Google so

350
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,780
we're gonna take that first MX record

351
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,660
and we are going to connect to it on

352
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,870
port 25 SMTP and we are going to do a

353
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:09,220
handshake we're gonna say hello from phu

354
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:12,909
kham mail from foo at bar comm it really

355
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,020
doesn't matter and recipient 2 is the

356
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,620
address that you want to determine

357
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:21,570
deliverability from the key thing here

358
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,250
is that Google will give us a 250 okay

359
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:29,280
telling us that this is a valid email

360
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:34,720
address so what does this look like when

361
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,280
it is invalid we get a 550 the email

362
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,860
account that you tried to reach does not

363
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,160
exist so you can do this for most

364
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,899
providers the only challenges are that

365
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,040
over there they're a bunch of challenges

366
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,750
here so gray listing IP blacklist sting

367
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,840
rate limiting there's some challenges

368
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:57,570
with SSL there's some undetermined

369
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,679
behavior by some gateways so Microsoft

370
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,820
will literally just return a random

371
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,040
results just like 1% of the time so you

372
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,290
kind of have to know ahead of time or do

373
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,210
your research or run some tests to know

374
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:14,580
what the behavior of these gateways are

375
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,580
and how to do that reliably

376
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:22,910
domain reputation so a lot of domain

377
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,879
reputation services for this or you

378
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,340
could try and build your own we use web

379
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,580
roots domain tools is good but they're

380
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:35,000
pretty expensive we use it we use a

381
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,639
couple of these the main inputs are in

382
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,610
to domain reputation I got a very high

383
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,870
level like age malicious activity is

384
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,199
anything looks suspicious

385
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:51,169
traffic ranking things like that lots of

386
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:53,900
services you can use for that front-end

387
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,160
stack so if it's a custom domain is

388
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,010
there anything that we can learn from

389
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,990
what's running on their website

390
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:03,680
are there any ad trackers running like

391
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:06,020
Google ads or Facebook like GTM Google

392
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,910
Analytics have they optimized this site

393
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,400
for SEO like those are things that a

394
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,200
real person or real company might do

395
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,210
that an attacker probably isn't gonna

396
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,040
put in the effort to do so we're just

397
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,670
trying to learn as much as we can really

398
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,899
about this domain and this email address

399
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,060
there are some services that you can use

400
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,590
for this WAP eliezer or built with

401
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,870
they'll literally tell you like what's

402
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,830
running on their site and you can use

403
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,830
that as inputs

404
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:38,280
site profiles so this is a big one

405
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,290
we do this in three ways we have a bunch

406
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,310
of automated Osen techniques that we've

407
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:46,620
built we have some data partnerships and

408
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:49,800
we have some third-party enrichments for

409
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,080
this as well so we're gonna focus on

410
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,909
automated Osen techniques and we're

411
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,770
literally just gonna tell you about a

412
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:59,120
bunch of the ones that we discovered and

413
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,120
how you could do this yourself

414
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:08,250
so who remembers this information

415
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,650
disclosure back in the day where you

416
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,080
could just like type in a username or

417
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:17,130
email and it would tell you that you

418
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,379
have a incorrect username and so you

419
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,740
could use that to enumerate accounts who

420
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,880
remembers that okay yeah pretty much

421
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,880
everybody so this is this is largely

422
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,440
fixed here on these login pages but I'm

423
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,980
here to tell you that information

424
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,780
disclosure is still alive and well

425
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:40,790
this same type of information disclosure

426
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:43,290
it's just not where you might expect so

427
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:47,490
we'll do it we'll do a live demo here on

428
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:50,040
how you can determine whether an email

429
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:55,500
address or profile exists on a service

430
00:21:50,040 --> 00:22:01,129
and how you can automate that so we're

431
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,130
gonna pull up last.fm here

432
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:21,169
nice all right so all right so instead

433
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,299
of going to the login page we are going

434
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:25,299
to go to the join page

435
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:38,040
all right and we are going to actually

436
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,040
can skip that

437
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:48,090
boom that email address is already

438
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:50,639
registered to another account so how do

439
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:57,570
we automate this we're going to pop open

440
00:22:50,639 --> 00:23:02,269
dev tools to the network tab I'm gonna

441
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:09,859
reload the page we're gonna type in

442
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:09,859
email address again we're gonna

443
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,320
the

444
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:37,159
let's try this again clear calm let's

445
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,160
try this again

446
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:51,330
oh okay xhr boom validate so this is

447
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:57,909
just an API call and we can see that the

448
00:23:51,330 --> 00:24:00,689
response is that email address is

449
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,890
already registered to another account so

450
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,790
so that's how we that's how we do this

451
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,790
for last.fm

452
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,969
[Music]

453
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:22,469
there are so many others practically

454
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:25,590
like I would say 90% of the sites that

455
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,420
you visit our vulnerable to this the

456
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,939
reason this is a conscious choice being

457
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,370
made by these services to improve the

458
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,230
user experience right so you got a new

459
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,840
user you want to you want to lower

460
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,100
friction as much as possible so you want

461
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,590
to tell them that when they're signing

462
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,580
up that you can't use this so we don't

463
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:48,050
really expect this to really go away so

464
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:51,659
yeah there's like there's a lot of these

465
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,919
there is a limitation that in in a lot

466
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,650
of cases you don't actually get the

467
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,240
actual profile so you know that a

468
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,010
profile you know that the email address

469
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,050
exists but you don't know the profile

470
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,790
associated we do have some techniques

471
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,220
for that we'll go into you know how we

472
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,340
determine that sometimes just something

473
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,670
that you should be aware of all right

474
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:15,290
Gravatar who has a Gravatar or it knows

475
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:18,740
what Gravatar is okay not everybody so

476
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:21,659
Gravatar is a globally recognized avatar

477
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:25,380
you don't know it you might not know it

478
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:29,820
but you probably have a Gravatar this is

479
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,860
a service that's used to associate an

480
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,310
email address with a profile photo and

481
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,830
some other user related information so

482
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:40,379
that when you sign up for an account on

483
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:43,320
a new service they can take that email

484
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,860
address query it and get like your photo

485
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,210
and a bunch of other info and populate

486
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,219
that in your account to make the

487
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,770
experience better so you probably don't

488
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,500
know it but you you you probably have

489
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,690
one you might not know it so this is how

490
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,800
you can automate the process of going

491
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:04,710
from an email address to Gravatar so we

492
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:08,050
see that we got a 200 here and we got a

493
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,420
link to the profile

494
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:13,240
why did we care about this this is a

495
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,970
sign of reputation this means that this

496
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:21,220
is a sign of history right real people

497
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:22,900
will have gravitas attackers don't so

498
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:27,310
it's just another input that we're using

499
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:32,020
to determine reputation history age

500
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:36,580
presence on the internet who knows about

501
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:38,770
this LinkedIn technique I'm about to

502
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,409
blow you guys mind right here so this is

503
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:45,310
I use this all the time you can go from

504
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:49,390
email address to LinkedIn account super

505
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:52,830
Andy sign a reputation email address

506
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,830
associated with the LinkedIn account

507
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:06,419
web crawling so this is a non-trivial

508
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:10,229
thing web crawling is a pain in the ass

509
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:13,270
but it's it's a necessary component of a

510
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:16,299
reputation system so there are three

511
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,740
components to this ingest as much data

512
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:23,918
as humanly possible

513
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:25,289
and tag that data create you know ingest

514
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,840
that in a smart way

515
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:33,010
draw relationships between disparate

516
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,030
data sources and profit off data so we

517
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:37,330
are going to go through an exercise

518
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:40,418
together on how we would do this to

519
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,418
build out some graph relationships so

520
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:45,549
we're gonna start off with LinkedIn

521
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:48,429
let's say that we have a LinkedIn

522
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:51,429
crawler there are lots of like open

523
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:53,770
source ones on github and whatnot and we

524
00:27:51,429 --> 00:28:00,280
are crawling LinkedIn and we come across

525
00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:04,330
this handsome guy's profile so we are

526
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:07,240
going to extract entities from this

527
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,370
profile and start building our graph so

528
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,520
we'll make this we'll do this together

529
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,889
so I'll start us off the first entity

530
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:18,460
that we're gonna extract is full name

531
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:21,270
Ian teal all right what's the next one

532
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,270
somebody

533
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:32,620
say get company sublime security

534
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:36,880
location Greater New York City school

535
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:39,729
one more connections very good

536
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,930
all right so where we're starting to

537
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:45,820
pull all these pieces of information

538
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:47,440
together I'll add one more image maybe

539
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,710
he's using the same image right so we'll

540
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,920
take we'll take a hash of that image and

541
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,690
we'll throw this into a graph so we have

542
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,200
a central node we have a node in the

543
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,790
center this is the LinkedIn profile

544
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,710
entity we're gonna give it an ID and

545
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:06,159
we're gonna associate all these entities

546
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,960
that we were extracting to that ID to

547
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,730
that profile

548
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:16,930
so these we're just drawing edges right

549
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:21,160
in this graph Twitter let's do the same

550
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:25,800
thing I'll start us off username at E&T

551
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,800
oh let's get another one

552
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,480
big picture okay we'll take a hash of

553
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,899
the picture very good he went the

554
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,420
shmoocon

555
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:41,040
all right is a display name the in teal

556
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,940
will be a true birthday location very

557
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,370
good all right

558
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,370
you guys get the point so extracting

559
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:50,330
entities throw it in a graph same deal

560
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:54,479
we'll do it one more time with Gravatar

561
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:58,530
what do we got profile photo we'll take

562
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,429
a hash of that we got full name same

563
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:07,020
name we'll throw that in a Gravatar

564
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:10,260
graph okay so we talked about images and

565
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,629
we talked about hashes the hash that

566
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,500
we're used to seeing as security people

567
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:18,330
is a is a cryptographic hash function

568
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,220
the definition of that is a small change

569
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,178
to a message should change the hash

570
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,830
value so extensively that the new hash

571
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:29,370
appears uncorrelated with the old hash

572
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:31,649
value so small change in the input

573
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:34,020
source results in a large change in the

574
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,550
output hash so when we're talking about

575
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,650
building graph relationships that's

576
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:41,610
actually the opposite behavior that we

577
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:44,490
want we have when you're on different

578
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,050
services they are normalizing that photo

579
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,610
maybe they're resizing them maybe

580
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:50,040
they're adding a tint or maybe they're

581
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:52,610
creating a circle or whatever and so

582
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,280
that is going to change this photo

583
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:58,559
slightly such that the the md5 or the

584
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,428
cryptographic hash is going to be unlike

585
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,690
you're not gonna be able to correlate

586
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:07,559
those so what we actually want to do is

587
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:09,690
use a perceptual hash function so this

588
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,920
is effectively the opposite behavior of

589
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:16,200
a cryptographic function we want small

590
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:20,640
changes to the input source to result in

591
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:24,210
small if not immeasurable changes to the

592
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,130
output hash so that'll that when we're

593
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,260
talking about just resizing and whatnot

594
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,110
those shouldn't really change the hash

595
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,360
value the perceptual hash value so

596
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,490
that's actually the the the type of hash

597
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,649
that we want to use here

598
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:41,110
so let's let's do this like let's let's

599
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:44,770
start drawing let's see what we can do

600
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:48,219
from here so we'll start off with an

601
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:51,460
email address right we have our Gravatar

602
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:55,030
technique and we're going from email

603
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:58,060
address to profile photo that's part of

604
00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:03,940
this Gravatar output right we'll take

605
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:10,330
that photo we'll do an md5 and we'll do

606
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:14,770
in a perceptual hash that's that's the

607
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:18,879
bottom average hash technique we're

608
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:25,180
gonna do the same thing with Twitter and

609
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:29,260
LinkedIn what do we see here in the top

610
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:32,290
three we have the three md5 s which are

611
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:35,950
completely different and the bottom

612
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:42,820
three look almost identical if not

613
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:45,970
identical so what we can actually do

614
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:49,500
here is subtract these perceptual hashes

615
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:53,350
from one another to get a distance so

616
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,820
Ian's Gravatar to Twitter distance we

617
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,919
saw that the MD files are completely

618
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:00,310
different there's actually a zero

619
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:03,940
difference from perceptual hash so these

620
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,770
are effectively the same image and for

621
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,390
Twitter and LinkedIn we only have a

622
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,450
difference of three so that's pretty

623
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,040
small

624
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,200
all right so you can see how this might

625
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,970
start to come come together so let's

626
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,330
fill in our graph so we're gonna throw

627
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:22,020
in the perceptual hash to this linked in

628
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:24,929
graph we're gonna throw in perceptual to

629
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:29,850
Twitter and we're gonna throw in

630
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:33,030
perceptual to Gravatar all right what do

631
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:37,290
we do now we got all this data you've

632
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:42,210
got all these lines let's start drawing

633
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:45,950
some relationships so if we in in our in

634
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:48,390
our graph if we can set a distance an

635
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,880
acceptable distance threshold for

636
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,490
perceptual hashes then we can start

637
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,520
drawing relationships even amongst not

638
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:59,490
identical perceptual hashes so we we

639
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:03,120
have we can easily do like identical

640
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:05,340
ones and we can we can use a distance

641
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,279
threshold to do like really similar ones

642
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,929
so we're starting to draw relationships

643
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,830
here between different profiles now

644
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:16,470
different services we can take that

645
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:19,139
further maybe some confirmation for us

646
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,790
that okay this is the same username that

647
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,290
makes me think I'm like we're on the

648
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:28,830
right track here this is the same

649
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:32,550
display name right and let's let's take

650
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:39,719
a look at what we have just done we went

651
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:42,950
from an email address to a nine year old

652
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,348
history on the Internet

653
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:48,290
this email address is associated with

654
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:51,849
the Twitter account since 2011 that is a

655
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,849
high source of reputation

656
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:04,319
all right let's talk about negative

657
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:06,990
inputs reporting this is this is huge so

658
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,220
we rely on the community for this we

659
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,580
have we have an incredible community

660
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:15,149
people who are in socks or people who

661
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:17,250
are in you know MSSP shops or whatever

662
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,560
it is and when they see malicious

663
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,170
messages come through phishing emails

664
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,490
their reporting and it's benefiting

665
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:26,760
everyone else in the community so we

666
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:29,160
have a simple API that you can use to

667
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:34,710
report and you can tag based off of the

668
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:38,100
behavior here that you see so a lot of

669
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:40,110
reporting happens on Twitter shout out

670
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,120
to a couple of these guys actor s Beau's

671
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,850
a and dub start these guys are killer

672
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,910
and hunting down phishing kits and doing

673
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:51,270
doing their thing and just reporting

674
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:53,250
like spam and phishing all the time J

675
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:55,350
cyber second neon prime time these guys

676
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:59,100
are killer at identifying phishing kits

677
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:01,950
and threat actors and organizations and

678
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,810
MSS PS like couldn't couldn't be doing

679
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,319
this without their help without the

680
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,320
community

681
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:13,210
some more negative inputs so anytime we

682
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,880
have a verified phishing attack within

683
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:20,860
our platform that gets reported back

684
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:23,830
into into email Rep dark web credential

685
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,110
leaks and compromises so if we are

686
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,160
working with a partner you know who's

687
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:30,820
really good at that or if we're doing

688
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,399
our own if we see some kind of data leak

689
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,190
or credential leak that may be a

690
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,420
negative input and recent data breaches

691
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:43,000
so if it just happened then that and

692
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,600
then that is probably going to be a sign

693
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,600
of suspicion

694
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,640
all right let's talk about blacklisting

695
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:54,319
a little bit so this is this is really

696
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,859
it's a really important concept so we

697
00:36:54,319 --> 00:37:00,959
the thing I want to emphasize is that

698
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:02,819
temporal badness is key when it comes to

699
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:06,538
email addresses especially those

700
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:07,589
associated with with people with high

701
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,439
reputation

702
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:12,180
you cannot just blacklist an email

703
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:16,439
address right because that is associated

704
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:19,979
with a person so you have to be very

705
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:22,709
careful as to how long you say something

706
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:25,709
is suspicious for and expire that based

707
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:28,680
off of the activity so if you continue

708
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:30,660
to see more and more malicious activity

709
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,649
maybe you have like an exponential decay

710
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,640
for like blacklisting or whatever it is

711
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,880
lots of things that you can do their

712
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,479
tags are critical input into this so a

713
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,869
threat actor tag we actually probably

714
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:49,828
will never expire that because that is

715
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:52,289
someone telling us that a that this is

716
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:53,880
this is the threat actors email address

717
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:56,640
there's there it will never be used for

718
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,410
good whereas account takeover okay this

719
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,328
is associated with a person we're gonna

720
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,839
expire this right unless we see more

721
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:02,839
activity

722
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,420
all right so what do we do with all this

723
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,770
information we're gonna synthesize all

724
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,720
these different positive and negative

725
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,450
inputs and we're gonna assign weights

726
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,600
based off of how difficult it would be

727
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:21,180
for an attacker to fake that data so we

728
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,730
talked about that Twitter account with

729
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:28,649
nine years of history that would be

730
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:32,060
difficult to fake data breach five years

731
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:36,510
ago probably even harder to fake like

732
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:39,170
yeah so it's we're we're looking for we

733
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:43,980
call this like proof of reputation right

734
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:46,710
and if you can like just spin up an

735
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,450
account that's gonna be it's gonna be a

736
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:52,530
lower weight into the reputation score

737
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:55,529
all right

738
00:38:52,530 --> 00:39:00,000
let's list let's dig into some some like

739
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:02,190
interesting data insights here so

740
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,840
request this is these are email rep

741
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:08,400
requests by profile for the last 90 days

742
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,800
so we can we can start to draw some

743
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,680
trends and like what actually might

744
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:19,590
constitute suspicious suspicious profile

745
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:22,890
behavior so we can see that like this

746
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:26,430
second one down forty nine percent of

747
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:29,640
email addresses that only have a

748
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:31,109
Pinterest account come from tor like

749
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,319
what is up with that like that's super

750
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,320
weird

751
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:39,869
we got we call this the the trio here so

752
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:42,900
Pinterest Twitter and Spotify 51% coming

753
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:44,999
from tour like super weird so we can

754
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,449
start looking at like activity like this

755
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:49,890
and and use that as inputs into what

756
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:55,140
might actually be like a suspicious

757
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:57,598
address free emo reputation or free

758
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,989
email provider distribution so this is

759
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,209
just like kind of interesting that 62%

760
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:08,689
of free providers that are queried have

761
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:08,689
high reputation 22% have no reputation

762
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:17,589
this is the obligatory Russia slide

763
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,589
[Music]

764
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:24,178
there's I don't know it's just kind of

765
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,909
interesting that Russians are using so

766
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:30,419
much FreeBSD and open BSD to use this

767
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:31,140
API where it's like no one else is it's

768
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:37,679
 is up with that

769
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:44,669
I don't know abuse we get a lot of we

770
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:47,909
get a lot of a lot of abuse sometimes a

771
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:51,058
wise man once said that sometimes free

772
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:54,110
just ain't free enough that was me I

773
00:40:51,059 --> 00:41:00,570
said that I said that

774
00:40:54,110 --> 00:41:03,690
this is what abuse looks like on January

775
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:08,720
12th that's probably our biggest our

776
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:13,080
biggest interval of abuse active IPs

777
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:15,120
that's the key thing here so we have we

778
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,880
have rate limiting by IP and this guy

779
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,279
was literally rotating IP is every 2

780
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,660
requests

781
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:27,630
he had like almost a hundred thousand

782
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:29,399
IPS requests by country so during this

783
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,920
interval like they're pretty much all

784
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,050
exclusively coming from South Korea we

785
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,350
were basically getting no requests from

786
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:39,060
South Korea at the time so we could

787
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:42,600
literally just block South Korea if we

788
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:48,180
wanted to and we'd be fine not saying we

789
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:50,370
did that or anything countermeasures so

790
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:54,509
the big thing that we do to to counter

791
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:56,850
this is we profile the abuse so we have

792
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:59,250
different some ways of of profiling that

793
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:02,700
I'm not going to discuss on here because

794
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,950
I don't want to rebuild those and when

795
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,799
we determine that there is abusive

796
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:11,970
behavior instead of sometimes we will

797
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,250
like 4:03 them like like drop the

798
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:17,040
request but most of the time we'll just

799
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:19,080
serve them fake data will tell them

800
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,840
we'll serve a random result will tell

801
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,600
you that there's 20 profiles associated

802
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,630
with with this email or there's none and

803
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,980
so the impetus there is like you don't

804
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,960
know what the you're getting so if

805
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:35,310
you're gonna use the service good luck

806
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,400
good luck knowing what's real we had to

807
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:41,430
reduce the on authenticate limit just to

808
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,270
because we were the costs were really

809
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:48,330
high for us gray noise has been a super

810
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:51,660
super helpful resource for us so a lot

811
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:55,140
of these IPS that were being used were

812
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:57,899
compromised boxes and it was effectively

813
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:01,400
a botnet and gray noise was really good

814
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,400
at knowing like when those things were

815
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:08,860
malicious basically an anomaly detection

816
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:10,500
so prepare yourselves for anomaly

817
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:13,120
detection

818
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,650
don't ask me what this does if you want

819
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,620
to know just go ask and he's sitting up

820
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,660
here and he'll you can explain it to you

821
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:22,089
but effectively you can we'll give you

822
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,100
the slide if you want it we're just

823
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:31,240
looking for anomalous activity within

824
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:35,200
the last hour basically some interesting

825
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:38,439
key requests stats so we get about five

826
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,700
to ten requests per day we have about a

827
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:46,720
50% rejection rate there's a lot of

828
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:49,839
sketchy profiles that our email address

829
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,000
is that we get requests for it we only

830
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,250
have about a five percent contested rate

831
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,160
that's that's effectively those are

832
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,330
people coming back to us saying that hey

833
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,029
like I think you made a mistake or

834
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:03,460
whatever I'm a real person and will

835
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:05,860
typically probably give that person a

836
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,180
key but that tells us that we're

837
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:10,060
probably doing a good job there's only

838
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,770
five percent sixty-seven percent of

839
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,840
these are from free email providers and

840
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,610
like we're seeing work we've automated

841
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,920
this whole process so we know like when

842
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:20,890
something is high rep and coming in for

843
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,560
a request so we have a principal at

844
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:25,000
sublime where we only use humans at the

845
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,710
part of the process where they can add

846
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,320
the most value we try and automate

847
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,630
everything else so for the kirakira

848
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,930
quests approval process this whole thing

849
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:38,410
is automated has anyone is anyone know

850
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:41,290
what zapier is or use zapier alright

851
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:43,750
zabi ER is the and everyone should

852
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:46,060
be using it if you're not to automate

853
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,880
like anything if you're having to like

854
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:50,770
spin up services or like build like

855
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,660
small you know small automation things

856
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:54,550
you can probably do it in zapier and

857
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:57,460
it'll probably save you a lot of time so

858
00:44:54,550 --> 00:45:00,460
we use app your heavily for that so we

859
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:03,820
have a CAPTCHA on email rep on the key

860
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:05,350
request page we have a post that will

861
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,320
hit zapier with the email that's

862
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:11,560
requesting the first sap will hit email

863
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:14,309
rep back for the reputation it will

864
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,920
check our slack channel for

865
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:18,390
for duplicates to see if anyone if that

866
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,199
email address has requested the key

867
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:24,989
before then it will post the email rep

868
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:27,150
to the slack channel so we have will

869
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:29,640
have all the results of email rep there

870
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,249
and then we have a second zap that's

871
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:36,660
listening in on that slack channel for

872
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:39,779
emoji reactions to that post a thumbs up

873
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:42,029
means that they're good and that they've

874
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:44,729
been approved and that kicks off another

875
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:49,140
workflow that will generate a key and

876
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:51,029
send an approval email a and X will send

877
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,308
them a rejection email so it literally

878
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:57,150
takes like a few seconds for us to do

879
00:45:53,309 --> 00:46:00,569
all this this is what it looks like so

880
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:01,140
we get a request so this is posting to

881
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:04,788
our Channel

882
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:11,819
there's no reputation for this email and

883
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:13,499
we are gonna block that this is what a

884
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:17,459
successful one looks like so there's

885
00:46:13,499 --> 00:46:20,968
high reputation it's been seen since a

886
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:26,098
couple years ago no problem easy check

887
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:29,489
mark alright how can you use email rep

888
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:32,640
if if you want it to so we have a simple

889
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:36,089
API that you saw before we have a Python

890
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,910
wrapper we have a Python wrapper and CLI

891
00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:41,189
we have a PowerShell module shout-out to

892
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:43,529
Kyle parish for that we have an R

893
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:46,140
wrapper shout-out to Bob Brutus for that

894
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:48,329
if you're using the hive like cortex

895
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,009
analyzers for any of your automation and

896
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:52,859
you're in like automation pipelines and

897
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:55,589
the sock we have an email rep analyzer

898
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:57,869
thanks to nino Seki and we also have a

899
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:59,819
there's a browser extension for doing o

900
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:02,219
s-- and stuff that email rep is a part

901
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:04,890
of if you're using auth0 for your

902
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:08,489
signups there's a write-up on how to do

903
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:11,819
that by matias at all zero if you're

904
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:14,099
using office 365 you can there's an

905
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:21,150
automation pipeline here and there's a

906
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:23,670
dotnet package that you can use so what

907
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:25,619
are people using email rep for so like

908
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,029
the biggest thing is phishing defense

909
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:28,709
like that's what we use it for

910
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:31,979
that's what email rep is like designed

911
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:34,160
to be better for a lot of socks they're

912
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:38,999
using us for incident response and like

913
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:42,509
Seymour soar alert Enrichment fraud is a

914
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:44,578
big one so upon account creation like is

915
00:47:42,509 --> 00:47:48,150
does this look legit or does it look

916
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:52,529
spammy as a blacklisted or whatever red

917
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:53,969
team so like when you're enumerated or

918
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:57,660
you're trying to conduct some you know

919
00:47:53,969 --> 00:48:00,269
campaigns trying to discover target

920
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,920
email addresses and the profiles

921
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:04,948
associated with them so you can conduct

922
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,589
hey you know which email address to to

923
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:11,309
target and B maybe that'll give you some

924
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:12,479
ideas on phishing templates like if you

925
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:14,339
know they have a Twitter account maybe

926
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:18,178
some of them it's Witter password reset

927
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:20,939
fish or something and we use it for lead

928
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:24,660
or basically validation for this funnel

929
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:28,200
for KPI key requests

930
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:30,700
we got a lot of stuff planned so

931
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:35,169
improving the account takeover use case

932
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:36,339
is is is the primary one so that's going

933
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,220
to be a lot of like community

934
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,620
engagements that's going to be trying to

935
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,120
get more data sources on credential

936
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,609
leaks and spam spam and phishing

937
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,160
campaigns there are a lot of insights

938
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:50,230
that we can start to draw here and

939
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,379
there's some some opportunities to apply

940
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:55,840
some machine learning stuff there will

941
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,970
be releasing other free api's so we're

942
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,220
like very you know open and community

943
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:04,200
driven so the next one that we're

944
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:07,109
building is a logo recognition API so

945
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:11,319
that's a basically a model for

946
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:14,830
determining what company logo is

947
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:17,080
potentially being impersonated we're an

948
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:20,020
early access for that if you want to try

949
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:22,630
that out let me know and reduce costs so

950
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:25,180
like this thing we never really built

951
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:27,160
this with the intent to like like make

952
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:30,220
it so open it was built built for our

953
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:33,430
own purposes internally so now that like

954
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:35,980
a lot of people are using it we have a

955
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:38,470
need to reduce the cost significantly so

956
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:40,480
it's pretty expensive for us right now

957
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:45,640
we have a lot of like plans for how to

958
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:50,320
reuse those costs hit me up if you have

959
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:52,089
breached data or a login API that we

960
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:56,350
could use instead of having to bang

961
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:59,380
against your like signup page we'd love

962
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:01,720
to just use an API if that's possible if

963
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,120
you got profile data or phishing

964
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:07,120
campaigns like what's that let's let's

965
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:13,259
let's hook up all right

966
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:13,259
live demo let's see what we got here

967
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:25,960
any well let's let's do it let's just do

968
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,960
this first

969
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,459
[Music]

970
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,670
all right first one I'll probably just

971
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:20,109
do like one or two so that we can do

972
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:21,310
questions all right who didn't who

973
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:23,380
submitted this one if you feel

974
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:26,109
comfortable all right

975
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,920
is this a legit email address what's

976
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:28,920
this what's the deal with this

977
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:37,240
secondary's okay so we can see here that

978
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:39,939
this email address has high reputation

979
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:43,899
it's associated with a person we've seen

980
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:49,869
it in data breaches since 2012 is that

981
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:52,960
right cool all right so we're coming up

982
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:58,060
on our time here so I guess we can just

983
00:51:52,960 --> 00:52:00,430
dig into output a little bit so yeah

984
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:04,380
we've seen credentials leaked but

985
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:09,790
nothing really recently February 20 19

986
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:11,530
de main exists obviously we're able to

987
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:16,380
associate it with us with a Pinterest

988
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,380
profile it's coming from a free provider

989
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,160
so yeah all right cool so let's do let's

990
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:30,950
do questions because we only have a

991
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:32,569
couple minutes yeah yeah please how do

992
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:35,089
we determine the weights is a question

993
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,880
yeah it's a good question so we will go

994
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:40,700
and create accounts on these services

995
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,490
and based off of the level of scrutiny

996
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:47,060
given to us while creating an account so

997
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:49,430
is there a do you do you require a phone

998
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:51,680
number like a legitimate phone number is

999
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,779
there a do they accept VoIP phone

1000
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,629
numbers or does it have to be a legit

1001
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:59,090
number is there

1002
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,560
you know like are there what scrutiny

1003
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:04,940
basically do they allow signups from

1004
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:07,730
VPNs so age is a big one like Twitter

1005
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,800
age or you know how long it's been so

1006
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:12,970
the thing that basically the difficulty

1007
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,970
of faking the data

1008
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:38,900
yeah yeah so it's it's not that rigorous

1009
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:41,580
so we we have a large quantity of

1010
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:44,190
malicious email addresses like things

1011
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,840
that we have been we have seen doing the

1012
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,460
conducting malicious activity and we

1013
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,400
have a large data set of things that

1014
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:53,190
have not and we look at the criteria in

1015
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,590
both like what profiles do they do those

1016
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,270
have what is the what are the ages and

1017
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:01,470
we try and assign weights off of those

1018
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:03,870
exits yeah to quick easy one how do you

1019
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:07,410
this is expensive do how are you gonna

1020
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:09,480
monetize this on you continue and to and

1021
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:13,200
you consider either creating an email

1022
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:17,640
client or plugin for like Outlook this

1023
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:19,439
is an example so people can buy this is

1024
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,240
the more secure browser so they can

1025
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,400
actually do the replication check on the

1026
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,310
emails on the blog yeah so good

1027
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,690
questions so the first question was

1028
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:30,420
because this is expensive how are we

1029
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:32,490
going to monetize it so we don't really

1030
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,830
have like we never built this we still

1031
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,779
don't have intent to monetize this we're

1032
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:38,730
trying to just basically get this down

1033
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:41,220
like anyone that wants really high

1034
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:44,160
volume we just give it to them at cost

1035
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,899
so sublime the phishing defense platform

1036
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,149
is our main thing so like that's the

1037
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,680
that's a big thing that we're building

1038
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:52,200
so that's how we plan to like sustain

1039
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:56,910
ourselves and everything like that and

1040
00:54:52,200 --> 00:55:01,279
the the second question was why don't we

1041
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:05,640
build and eat in a mail app basically

1042
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:10,020
yeah okay so we have considered building

1043
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:13,020
a like a Chrome extension or like an

1044
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:15,210
outlook plugin so that when and a

1045
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,680
message comes in it shows you like a

1046
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,570
little green checkmark that is high

1047
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,000
reputation or something like that we

1048
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,410
just haven't had the cycles to do that

1049
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,720
yeah

1050
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:28,580
definitely interested yeah place you

1051
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,580
determine if in the email address

1052
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:37,440
so it's a good question we have we have

1053
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:39,509
a we've been collecting lists of free

1054
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,120
email providers like from all over the

1055
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:44,130
internet basically and we're just like

1056
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,960
combining those aggregating those

1057
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,300
keeping an eye out for new ones as they

1058
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,010
pop up there are some interesting things

1059
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:54,300
like interesting techniques that can be

1060
00:55:50,010 --> 00:56:00,860
done as well too yeah yeah we should

1061
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:00,860
talk more about that yeah yeah yeah good

1062
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:19,610
yeah so the question was have we

1063
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:23,540
considered doing reputation checks

1064
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:25,040
against eBay and I think eBay is

1065
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,380
vulnerable to this information

1066
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,940
disclosure and we just haven't built

1067
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:31,580
that yet but that would be a great one

1068
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:34,450
because you if you can determine the

1069
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:37,549
profile associated then there may be

1070
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:39,109
account history there may be purchases

1071
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,840
and those are very high sources of

1072
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:45,230
reputation so that's a good one

1073
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:48,250
do we have time still four minutes okay

1074
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:48,250
any other questions

1075
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:57,810
sweet what's that what is our limit yeah

1076
00:56:54,990 --> 00:57:01,520
