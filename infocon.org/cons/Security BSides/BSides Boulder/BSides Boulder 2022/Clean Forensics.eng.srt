00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,800
rights

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,759
our next speaker is Quran duvetti Quran

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,320
is a manager or technical lead and the

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,900
security team at Google and his talk is

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,240
titled clean forensics analyzing Network

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,340
traffic of vacuum Bots

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,430
please give me a warm welcome

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,699
[Applause]

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,960
thank you love the energy here it's

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,360
still like 3 30 p.m and I was like I'm

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,460
the last talk so I need to make it

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,739
interesting

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,140
um thanks everybody especially uh the

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,020
organizers uh Matt uh Punk quarter

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,360
everybody thanks for having me here and

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,000
lovely audience all right so I'm gonna

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,539
talk uh today about vacuum Bots before I

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,980
actually you know dive into the

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,559
technical content show of hands how many

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,899
of you have a vacuum board or want to

21
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,260
purchase one or if curious about them oh

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,480
quite a few hands all right how many of

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,500
you think they are secure

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,479
no hands

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,020
all right I like the crowd

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,299
so a little bit introvert me uh I'm

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,640
Karan you can call me k

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,580
um I'm a security manager at Google

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,159
uh I'm an infosec alumni from Carnegie

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,520
Mellon I spent two wonderful years there

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,000
um for fun I write blogs at all

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
thingspawn.com I mostly write about

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,619
security engineering interviews try to

34
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,400
help people land jobs

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,079
I also spend time reviewing Journal

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,780
papers so some of the research stuff and

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,159
it's very exciting to see what's

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,360
happening in the field

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,240
and for fun I love to travel I'm here I

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,220
just flew in last night and I loved

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,500
going to the beach so

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,360
with that

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,740
let's look at some of the things we'll

44
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,479
discuss today right so we want to get

45
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,479
started with why vacuum Bots like why

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,159
are we even talking about that right we

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,840
talk about iot a lot which is

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,939
understandable but why specifically

49
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,380
vacuum watch

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,239
with that understanding we'll go into

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,520
some of the functionality right how do

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,980
they work what features do they have

53
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,440
and you know some of the missing things

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,420
that are not so popular

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,520
then we'll dive into the interesting

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,580
parts right we'll talk about how every

57
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,620
one of you in this room can conduct

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,720
Network forensics on your own right it's

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,000
not rocket science it's very very

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
interesting

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,620
and then the most interesting part I

62
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,760
would say

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,099
um or maybe not uh mostly secured in

64
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,440
privacy issues that I discovered in some

65
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,519
of the Bots

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,280
and then for fun I'll also show you the

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,200
reported issues so I actually talked to

68
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,420
one of the vendors no names will be

69
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,220
taken in this room I know this is being

70
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,840
recorded and will remain on the internet

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,840
for a while so but I'll show you the

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,160
communication and I'll show you the

73
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,739
challenges of when you report issues

74
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,379
what really happens right and then I'll

75
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,180
give you time for Q a

76
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,060
if I see the audience engaged I'll end

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,620
early I promise

78
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,920
all right so with that and obviously uh

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,379
the typical disclaimer this is my own

80
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,000
research Google has nothing to do with

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,940
this right so you can blame me

82
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,319
all right

83
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,140
so let's talk about why research vacuum

84
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,580
bonds

85
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,260
and I think if I just leave this slide

86
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,780
and just let it be it speaks volumes but

87
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,400
I'll still speak

88
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,220
um so if you see this trend this data is

89
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,340
taken from grandviewresource.com

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,200
um some credits to them

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
they have shown that over a period of

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,360
time since 2016 at least on the slide we

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,700
see an uptick in the number of bots

94
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,360
being sold right year over year it is

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,019
projected to grow by 23 percent

96
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,580
every year

97
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,540
by 2027 the numbers is expected to be

98
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,980
60.9 million units these are Bots

99
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,019
running everywhere it's like an army of

100
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,200
parts

101
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,239
some of the major players uh let's look

102
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,159
at the market right let's see who was

103
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,019
actually capturing this market so I've

104
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,760
listed on some names on the left so

105
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,940
you'll see uh these manufacturers but

106
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,459
it's not really Consolidated right no

107
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,100
single manufacturer is dominating the

108
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,460
market but also not it's not also

109
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,620
fragmented right so it's kind of like

110
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,600
there are territories and then people

111
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,040
have actually got their territories

112
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,360
right and they marked their own

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
territories

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
um

115
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,500
it's kind of interesting and we'll see

116
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,620
why

117
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,479
so with that with that intro let's look

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,979
at some of the functionality right what

119
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,660
can you do when you go and buy one of

120
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,919
these

121
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,440
so the most common and obvious thing is

122
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,020
cleaning right but it's not just that

123
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,720
you can have Auto so you can just tell

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,600
about hey go clean and it's supposed to

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,699
figure out like the area it's supposed

126
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,220
to clean how fast and how much time and

127
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,900
all that on its own

128
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,240
you can tell it to clean its edges so it

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,520
can say in this room go around the edges

130
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,220
right just the edges you can also say

131
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,139
hey there's a spot that's dirty clean

132
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,120
that spot or you can just say hey I'm

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,680
going to manually control you and you

134
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,479
can control the button through a path

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,340
you want

136
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,500
you can also set up schedules and this

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,600
is interesting right you can say hey

138
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,780
every Sunday do not bother me 7am start

139
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,060
cleaning right and yeah it will bother

140
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,740
you because it makes a lot of noise at

141
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,020
least some of them do

142
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,960
um some of the fancy Bots have a health

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,020
monitoring feature so you can in their

144
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,060
app you can actually see how much you

145
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,280
know life span you have left for the

146
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,960
brushes right how long you have to

147
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,280
replace them stuff like that

148
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,680
here's a here's an example right so I've

149
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,380
taken this in an undisclosed location

150
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,740
here's a bot that's trying to map an

151
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,900
area that I was trying to clean

152
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,979
you'll see the bot is the dot generally

153
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,440
and someone has a zzz probably sleeping

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,080
and it's actually mapped this area on

155
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,759
its own right so the blue lines the

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,919
solid blue lines that you see it has

157
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,960
gone around and figured it out

158
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,620
the white lines

159
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,940
right sort of gone through it has

160
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,919
followed that path right it's a

161
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,900
combination of from what it seems like

162
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,360
it's a combination of uh breadth first

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,039
and then depth first algorithm right

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
that's what I saw from the lines but

165
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,340
anyway

166
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,860
some of the Bots also give you

167
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,580
um

168
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,979
features for multi-floor mapping so

169
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,900
let's say you have a house that has

170
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,080
multiple stories you can take the bot at

171
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,479
any story and it will map each floor and

172
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,639
sometimes the auto detect Which floor

173
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,660
they're on pretty fascinating right

174
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,180
um only few of them at least in my

175
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,060
research gave you the ability to view a

176
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,080
live stream so technically the bot is

177
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,060
looking around

178
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,940
that makes sense

179
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,220
all right so with that understanding of

180
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,380
functionality let's look at when you

181
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,819
when you buy one of these parts right

182
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,160
off the shelf how do you set it up what

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,240
happens

184
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,160
so in this example I've given some of

185
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,099
the you know basic components

186
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,560
you have a phone right you install the

187
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,479
app generally every manufacturer has an

188
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,240
app you can just click and install

189
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,759
um there's a bot and you have a modem

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,940
connecting Ur home to the internet

191
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,280
so the the border that you see on the

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
left the black one is your home network

193
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,680
and anything outside is external

194
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,319
so step one you install the app you

195
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,240
create an account right you enter your

196
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,400
basic credentials your name email stuff

197
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,259
like that and you say hey create an

198
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,400
account for me

199
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,440
that's what happens

200
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,360
in The Next Step you turn on the bot

201
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,699
right

202
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,800
and the app generally tries to search

203
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,139
for that bot right for that manufacturer

204
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,880
it will say hey are you around is

205
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,220
anybody around that I know of and it's

206
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,900
kind of interesting how they have made

207
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,780
it work so it's not as simple as hey bot

208
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,759
connect to my home network directly

209
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,099
that's not what I saw what happened

210
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,199
the app will do a search

211
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,599
and the bot will start up a Wi-Fi

212
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,819
network of its own

213
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,979
and it's going to broadcast it out

214
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,319
so that's another Network apart from

215
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,699
your home network

216
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,620
and it's going to say hey connect to me

217
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,099
I'm here what happens there is your

218
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,580
phone or that app connects to this wi-fi

219
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,919
network and it exchanges your

220
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,440
credentials off the home network

221
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,419
so it's a way to securely exchange

222
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,679
credentials that's really what's

223
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,720
happening in these three arrows and

224
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,880
after that once it's can talk outside

225
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,820
from your home it can say look I know

226
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,560
this person this account

227
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,540
I'm in this house or this this person

228
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,180
owns the bot right let's associate

229
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,339
myself with this account right so that's

230
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,320
the call it makes finally

231
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,940
and now you have a functioning part in

232
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,860
your house house

233
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,360
make sense

234
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,940
I see no it's cool all right

235
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,640
so that's very basic of you know how the

236
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,920
Bots work how you can set it up but

237
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
let's talk about how you can set up your

238
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,100
own home network right and this is

239
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,600
something you guys can do or all of you

240
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,519
can do you go back

241
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,839
so let's say you want to look at the

242
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,060
traffic right you want to examine what

243
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,040
is the bot really sending out of your

244
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,600
house

245
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,820
do we know like do we know this yet

246
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,800
I didn't right

247
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,500
so I to to show the point I actually

248
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,660
took a picture in my apartment and this

249
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,940
is how it looked like don't be scared of

250
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,279
the wires I'll simplify them in the next

251
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,120
diagram but the point here is it is very

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,279
very inexpensive for anybody to run the

253
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
setup so case in point I was able to do

254
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,820
it in around 150 ish right and this

255
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,459
includes my modem right so can be

256
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,279
anything I had a basic switch in the

257
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,740
middle that you see there

258
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,360
um it just needs to have Port mirroring

259
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,680
which is actually a very common feature

260
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,620
these days and then I also have an

261
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,680
internal router and I'll talk about why

262
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,660
and then a bunch of cables you can buy

263
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,899
them all for 10 bucks not that expensive

264
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,000
and at the bottom I had you know a Mac

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,620
and a phone to test this out so the

266
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,420
phone had the app and the Mac was used

267
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,580
to look at the traffic

268
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,839
makes sense

269
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,160
all right

270
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
so here's the icon view of that diagram

271
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
right and this makes it a little bit

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,339
simpler I hope to understand what's

273
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,779
Happening Here

274
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,060
so we have the bot right

275
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,740
and we have the cable modem on the right

276
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,600
so let's start from the right go to the

277
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,640
left so it's easier to understand

278
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,980
so from the right the cable modem talks

279
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,540
outside your home network that's your

280
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,360
point for any communication inside the

281
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,800
home to outside

282
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,120
simple enough

283
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,180
the app or the your mobile phone is

284
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,220
connected to that Wi-Fi network it's not

285
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,899
connected to the cable right it's

286
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,180
through the Wi-Fi network of the cable

287
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,880
modem and it's talking out so you don't

288
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,120
see anything this site from the phone

289
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,880
right it's just talking now

290
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,120
the switch is connected to both the

291
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,579
internal router and the external modem

292
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,740
right it's kind of in the middle and

293
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,779
that's for a reason because it has a

294
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,800
mirror port

295
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,140
and what I've done is I've connected my

296
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,140
machine or the Mac to the mirror port

297
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,000
okay

298
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,200
the bot is connected to the Wi-Fi SSID

299
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,899
of the internal router which is then

300
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,459
connected to the switch

301
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,380
so now if you think about this setup for

302
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,640
a second I know that's a lot of words

303
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,800
but if you think about communication of

304
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,980
the bot right let's say the bot says oh

305
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,079
associate account or I'm here

306
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,060
that packet is going to go through the

307
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,860
router to the switch to the modem out

308
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,260
but it will also go through the mirror

309
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,339
port

310
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,380
when the response come back it will go

311
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,260
straight back but it will also go down

312
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,480
because it's mirroring all the traffic

313
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,519
and that's how you can set up and listen

314
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,320
to all the things that are happening

315
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,480
through the bottle right that's the

316
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,040
reason of using the internal router and

317
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,060
the switch

318
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,779
simple enough right any questions here

319
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,360
no all right cool

320
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,160
now let's get into a little bit more fun

321
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,680
part right what did we see or what did I

322
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,959
see for some of the examples that I ran

323
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,279
this through

324
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,620
so let me explain like what I tested

325
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,920
first so with this setup right I tested

326
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,540
several functionalities we just talked

327
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,079
about so what happens when you establish

328
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,519
you know when you set up the connection

329
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,279
when you set up the bot that's case one

330
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,620
what happens when you say oh start

331
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,060
cleaning

332
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,240
what happens when you say move the bond

333
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
what happens when you say start

334
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,200
capturing video

335
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,720
I don't know but that's the setup will

336
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,940
enable us to check that data and then I

337
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,579
conducted analysis of okay I see you

338
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,260
know I see this traffic going on what's

339
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,940
the protocol can I look at it can I

340
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,360
examine it and why and why and why right

341
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,360
so here's an example I have not named

342
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,940
particular bots of vendors just to make

343
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,680
this talk a little bit more generic

344
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
right

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,700
um but I've seen a lot of patterns and

346
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,320
I'm going to stress on the patterns here

347
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,260
okay so the most common thing I saw is a

348
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,600
lot of bots are configured to talk to a

349
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,040
cloud service

350
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,660
that makes sense right they need to talk

351
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,880
externally why not a cloud service and

352
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,980
the first thing to do is hey I want to

353
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,260
talk to this domain I need to know the

354
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,180
IP the only way to for them to know that

355
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,860
is DNS

356
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,320
so we clearly see a DNS response coming

357
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,480
back and I know the Wireshark screenshot

358
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,459
is really really big and I tried to

359
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,860
blank things out you know but

360
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,620
essentially this exchange is saying hey

361
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,620
the first packet out is DNS tell me you

362
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,420
know a particular domain that I belong

363
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,639
to so

364
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,360
cloudservice.manufacture.com right it

365
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,459
can be hosted anywhere and I want to

366
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,760
talk to that IP right

367
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,920
the next thing I saw was once you get

368
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,740
that IP the bot established a TCP

369
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,700
connection

370
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,980
so now things are getting real right

371
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,620
so I didn't put Wireshark captures on

372
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,260
purpose here because there was a lot of

373
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,279
data

374
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,260
and I try to abstract out some of the

375
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,300
stuff that was interesting

376
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,639
and I know people are shaking heads does

377
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,740
anybody recognize what protocol that

378
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,720
looks like

379
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,380
on the right

380
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,459
looks familiar

381
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,899
I'm hearing mumbling but

382
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,899
a little bit louder so I can hear

383
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,760
and it's fine to be wrong it's totally

384
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
okay

385
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,120
yes close enough and what protocols use

386
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,800
XML

387
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,620
something over the network

388
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,560
or something like an example

389
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,599
whoever is behind thank you eggs

390
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,800
yeah correct xmpv exactly right so

391
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,079
they are actually using xmpp in this

392
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,339
case

393
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,660
is xmpp secure

394
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,420
it's plain text so no right but we'll

395
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,279
get to that right but it's very clear

396
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,959
when I when I say on the app turn right

397
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,720
what really happens is you see that IDE

398
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,440
and you see a particular atom feed it's

399
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,440
like a published subscribe model right

400
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,480
so it's like chat Bots

401
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,220
a lot of these Bots are chat Bots

402
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,760
they're just talking as a chat app

403
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,800
right and you say Hey you see the action

404
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,199
spin right I don't know what TD is maybe

405
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,720
it's a category of command no that's

406
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,160
that's how they have implemented it but

407
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,560
it says move right and then I get back a

408
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,920
response that says result and a type but

409
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,540
it doesn't say anything it's probably

410
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,980
saying success

411
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,779
right so this is what I saw on the

412
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,139
network when I hit one tab on the app

413
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,120
and it's very fascinating you can map

414
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,560
every feature and you see what's

415
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,420
happening on the network

416
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,360
all right similarly I said start

417
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,820
cleaning or stop cleaning same stuff

418
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,420
just for a little bit more information

419
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,699
so if you look at it it says clean and

420
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,320
there's also extra information like

421
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,699
speed

422
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,680
there's also a clean report coming back

423
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,740
right so all of this implementation

424
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,720
can be reversed engineered just by

425
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,519
looking at the traffic

426
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,860
simple enough right

427
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,980
there's also keep alive so after you're

428
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,420
done cleaning and you're happily you

429
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,339
know moving on to your work the bot is

430
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,079
still talking out maybe

431
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,240
it the Cloud Server might say hey bot

432
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,519
are you alive and it should say yeah and

433
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,500
this happens in your house without you

434
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,579
knowing

435
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,480
it's not malicious but it happens right

436
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,540
yeah

437
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:52,980
good question right how often is the key

438
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,139
for life is a question it it depends on

439
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,940
the implementation the bot or the

440
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,740
particular vendor and as I said I'm

441
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,139
trying to abstract it out it can be

442
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,060
anywhere from a few minutes to an hour

443
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,359
it depends generally when I saw Bots

444
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,760
cleaning it was more often just to see

445
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,020
like you know things are on track it's

446
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,179
not stuck it can communicate but like

447
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,579
when it stopped and like charging maybe

448
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,579
less right but this was clearly seen on

449
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,199
the network so

450
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,660
and there's a clear giveaway because

451
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,359
there says exempt right so you can see

452
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,260
the protocols all pretty clearly here

453
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,240
authentication we talked about security

454
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,500
right

455
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,080
this this when I saw this

456
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,580
um I stopped looking at the traffic for

457
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,799
at least 10 minutes

458
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,360
there was clearly a plain text password

459
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,000
being used in XMP before Authentication

460
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,539
didn't expect that but you know it's

461
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,400
it's it's also sometimes not surprising

462
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,740
because the functionality you know maybe

463
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,419
people just want to implement it and get

464
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,980
it off the ground and you know get in

465
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,840
the market I don't know how the

466
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,700
development life cycle was

467
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,340
but anyway we saw it there I removed it

468
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,260
from from this slide because you know

469
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,480
the essence is pretty clear here

470
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,700
and then uh it comes back from the

471
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,679
server as an acknowledgment

472
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,299
the protocol actually used here which

473
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,059
was the interesting part was sasm and

474
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,740
everybody here can look it up and read

475
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,020
about it it offers different types of

476
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,240
authentication so you can do a password

477
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,919
you can do sorry you can do a plain text

478
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,140
password you can also have a better

479
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,539
version of the same thing but in this

480
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,059
case it was just plain password

481
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,520
so

482
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,799
in another set of bots so there were

483
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,900
some of them involved but in another set

484
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,380
of bots there was a better version of of

485
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,020
this authentication something excuse me

486
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,660
something called as secure mqtt

487
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,299
mqtt like for those who don't know is

488
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,880
also a machine to machine protocol just

489
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,440
like you know it has a published

490
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,900
subscribe model so the same stuff on the

491
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,640
ground

492
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,960
but there's a secure version of the same

493
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,400
protocol

494
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,960
I saw the port being used as 8883

495
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,580
hmm okay

496
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,260
their status and this was really

497
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,419
unexpected and I'll I'll talk about this

498
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,940
why so you have you have sometimes all

499
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,380
of us look at phones right so we're

500
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,880
looking at our phones like this

501
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,740
literally like this

502
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,900
and you can open an app and you'll be

503
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,700
like okay let me open that we don't

504
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,960
think about it

505
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,900
but when I opened this particular app I

506
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,820
actually saw traffic

507
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,820
and I was like wait I didn't do anything

508
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,860
what's happening

509
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,059
turns out the bot is trying to get the

510
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,320
time

511
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
it's trying to get the time

512
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,400
which is correct for itself

513
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,580
and the weight was doing that was by

514
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,179
getting the time from the phone

515
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,160
and the way it was clear to me is I had

516
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,020
to reverse engineer it a little bit but

517
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,299
if you see the bolded line time T equals

518
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,340
something right some big number that's

519
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,140
an Epoch time right so you can convert

520
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,940
it into the current time which I did

521
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,280
here right and you can see when I was

522
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,260
testing this

523
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,539
um and there's also a TZ it's a time

524
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,820
zone I was in California at the time so

525
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,460
TZ is minus seven UTC makes perfect

526
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,900
sense

527
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,299
but is this good

528
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,500
is there any issue with this

529
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,059
you think so

530
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,480
why

531
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,980
location

532
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,200
yeah it does reveal some of the

533
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,059
locations thank you exactly and we'll

534
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,440
talk about that in one of the issues

535
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,720
that I actually ended up reporting

536
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,039
correct

537
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,559
so we saw this unexpected right I didn't

538
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,240
do any action on my phone but I saw this

539
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,640
so with that a little bit of the shock

540
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,559
I'm seeing in this room right now let's

541
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,000
talk a little bit about the security and

542
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,980
privacy issues that I actually you know

543
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,780
collected and then I'll show you the

544
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,799
reporting part as well

545
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,080
so can these Bots be hijacked or

546
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,780
controlled that was my obvious question

547
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,539
when I did the research I'm seeing a lot

548
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,220
of traffic on the network I'm seeing a

549
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,020
plain text password

550
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,419
can somebody just come in and say it's

551
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,000
not your Bot anymore it's not it's mine

552
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,340
and it can be somebody walking into my

553
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,440
apartment

554
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,900
right so there are two parts to this one

555
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,659
is remote can somebody do it remote they

556
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,760
don't have to be a local attacker on my

557
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,500
home network right

558
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,659
this is hard in my experience when I

559
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,039
thought about it I looked at the traffic

560
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,679
it's a little bit hard for you to get

561
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,120
into the home network you'll have to

562
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,940
compromise it but an easier way

563
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,940
is just get control of the app

564
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,580
the app does not have any two Factor it

565
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,380
just has a username and password so you

566
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,539
can set your password as clean me and

567
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,640
really that's the only control you have

568
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,940
or security you have quote unquote uh to

569
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,919
get control of any device through

570
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,200
control through that app

571
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,120
that was fascinating to me I'm like huh

572
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,460
now I need to worry about the security

573
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,620
of apps on my phone

574
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,179
so you see how the thread model is

575
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,700
moving from the iot device to the phones

576
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,580
and that's why it becomes complicated

577
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,380
and we talked about the local one right

578
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,000
so you can replay the commands we saw

579
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,919
play index commands right as long as

580
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,600
there is no nonce value that's saying

581
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,340
okay this is a new command and it

582
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,559
expires after like 30 seconds you can

583
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,299
replay those commands back over the

584
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,320
network

585
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,760
and the bot will do what you say

586
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,400
what about floor plans it's also moving

587
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,900
around just like you it's just another

588
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,299
human because it can also look at live

589
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,460
video

590
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,400
what about the privacy of floor plans so

591
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,460
this is interesting right sometimes I've

592
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,260
seen and this varies so I'm not going to

593
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,419
generalize my statements here but it

594
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,760
really depends on where the floor plans

595
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,860
are stored so they can be stored on your

596
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,360
phone

597
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,000
maybe okay but they can also be stored

598
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,340
in the cloud associated with your

599
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,520
account

600
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,740
again on the network I did not

601
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,679
explicitly find traffic that looked like

602
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,960
a floor plan it's very hard it's very

603
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,980
challenging and I'm being very

604
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,600
transparent about this because I'm not

605
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,960
saying oh this method is like complete

606
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,299
in any way but it gives you a lot of

607
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:25,620
information

608
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,140
so I didn't find it if you do first

609
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,900
anything else please talk to me

610
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,260
or best to talk to the vendors

611
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,000
course location somebody correctly

612
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,820
pointed out uh the location issue so yes

613
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,679
it's not precise by the way because we

614
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,799
still have a time zone uh I would say an

615
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,500
area of the time zone but let's say I

616
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,600
taking this phone I have I have an app I

617
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,880
have Bots I travel to I don't know

618
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,640
Zurich Switzerland for example right and

619
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,600
I have a bot in California

620
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,559
the moment the time zone changes from

621
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,020
this and I open the app my bot is gonna

622
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,120
think it's somewhere else it's it's in

623
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,780
UTC UTC time zone of Zurich right and

624
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,400
it's going to mess up the schedule of

625
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,900
the bot

626
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,659
so instead of starting at 6am or 7 am on

627
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,659
a Sunday it will be off by seven hours

628
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,360
and I tested this accidentally

629
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,460
I didn't even know about it and it

630
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,960
suddenly started one day and I was just

631
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,000
testing my time zones I just changed the

632
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,780
time

633
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,179
and so sometimes you discover things by

634
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,100
accident as well but it can be proven if

635
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,539
you look at the traffic so it's all

636
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,400
visible at the end

637
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,500
uh this was interesting because you can

638
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,299
mess up schedules and that can have

639
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,039
different human effects

640
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:41,059
people might be pissed off

641
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,620
video recordings right

642
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,280
um

643
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,020
this was interesting I wasn't very

644
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,840
scared about it after I saw the data but

645
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,640
like for people who spend a lot of time

646
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,780
in what shark

647
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,179
if you see the left screenshot the

648
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,820
screenshot on the left you see almost

649
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,820
equal sized packets being exchanged over

650
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,080
UDP

651
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,280
you know sounds like something that's

652
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,140
not reliable like a video stream

653
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,539
or an audio stream right so this was a

654
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,159
clear giveaway okay I clicked start

655
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,140
video and I see this boom boom on and

656
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,760
it's just really quick because it has a

657
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,260
lot of data right

658
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,659
when I examined the packet

659
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,820
I said hey give me the details

660
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,120
I luckily did not see it being a sum

661
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,799
protocol that I recognized I couldn't

662
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,799
decode it per se but I did find some

663
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,900
metadata right and that's the part I've

664
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,080
highlighted for everybody here so if if

665
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,059
it's too small I'll read it right it

666
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,480
says message type start streaming

667
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,760
so you still get a sense of when the

668
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,820
user started looking at the video

669
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,400
it will also give you a session ID I

670
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,600
don't know what you can use it for that

671
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,340
for for what reason but that's still

672
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,200
data and give me more data I'm happy

673
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,360
right so there is some metadata being

674
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,340
leaked that is you're not completely

675
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,100
aware except you know the stream is just

676
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,418
fine at least from what I saw

677
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,039
all right so we saw we saw the

678
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,900
functionality we saw how to set it up

679
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,240
for yourself we saw some of the issues

680
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,840
now this is this is the most uh I don't

681
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
know fear slash interesting uh

682
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,100
conversation so I'm going to show you a

683
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,260
bunch of emails and that's an exchange

684
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,760
with a vendor

685
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,440
the vendor names or anything else that

686
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
gives away the name is blanked out so

687
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,700
don't worry but it's interesting

688
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,059
nonetheless

689
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,220
okay so that's me and the part that's

690
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,260
highlighted is the date and time so I

691
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,179
want everybody here to watch the date

692
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,120
and time okay don't worry about reading

693
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,980
it I just put it as a proof that I'm not

694
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,779
bluffing everybody here this actually

695
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,760
happened right I can show you on my

696
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,080
phone later

697
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,900
without blanking out anyway but

698
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,700
um essentially

699
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,740
If You observe the date and time it is

700
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,960
November 18 2019. so I've been doing

701
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,520
this research for about good two years

702
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,039
now and that was the first time I

703
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,919
reported so I said hey by the way hello

704
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,340
XYZ support here's what I found and I

705
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,960
had to write a long one because if you

706
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,100
write a small one they don't think

707
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,480
you're serious

708
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,700
so I completely write down my research

709
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,799
and said hey this is what I found so I

710
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,200
told them here's the background right I

711
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,120
told them issues one by one so I said

712
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,520
hey by the way I see insecure protocols

713
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,799
I see plain text passwords I see

714
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,659
potential man the Millet attack on the

715
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,820
local network right and that's all the

716
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,020
text here

717
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,880
I also see course location tracking

718
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,860
right and for this one I was very

719
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,659
specific because I showed them what I

720
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:31,919
captured because they won't believe me

721
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,840
otherwise right

722
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,760
anyway

723
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,980
um it was like explaining everything

724
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,779
that they knew but they already knew

725
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,299
hopefully but anyway

726
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,279
and then I finally you know was also

727
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,500
transparent about the privacy of floor

728
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,779
plans again I remember I didn't test

729
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,179
this completely or thoroughly and I

730
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,159
actually wrote that but I wanted them to

731
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,960
investigate and like look at it and say

732
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,059
is this okay are we doing good or can we

733
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,919
change something

734
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,900
who in this room can guess what happened

735
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,260
next

736
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,539
[Applause]

737
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,460
who remembers the timeline what date or

738
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,380
what month did I send this

739
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,220
it was four year four slides ago

740
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,740
November 2019. okay cool everybody's

741
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,600
everybody's awake awesome

742
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,940
I have to do these pop quizzes

743
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,039
all right uh

744
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,140
guesses for what happened next

745
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,919
random guesses

746
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,000
they ignored it

747
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,140
reported you to the police

748
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,779
somebody reported me to the fullest I

749
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,220
don't confidently say on with the

750
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,860
recording on that I'm clean so I'm I'm

751
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,539
still here I'm still here giving a talk

752
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,120
about the same thing so either the you

753
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,539
know I don't want to comment any further

754
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:52,100
any other guesses before I hit next

755
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,419
later to the day A year later today

756
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,680
awesome

757
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,440
[Music]

758
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,419
they ignored it so whoever said ignored

759
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:04,740
it was right

760
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,600
um I actually closed the ticket so they

761
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,559
went one step further

762
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,880
if you see the date

763
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,340
if you see the date it's not that far so

764
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,200
I I would have to give give it up to

765
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,860
them for for the promptness

766
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,240
but if you see this part

767
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,980
I didn't click any of those links by the

768
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,419
way

769
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,620
what do you think happens next

770
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,200
this time it's probably on me right well

771
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,100
maybe on them I don't know

772
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,100
public disclosure

773
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,559
good good thinking you're vacuum is

774
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,340
seriously stopped working

775
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,799
I would question my if so the audience

776
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,140
said uh one person said my vacuum's not

777
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,220
working

778
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,140
I would be very concerned at that point

779
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,600
and I would re-examine my methods again

780
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,700
if I miss something

781
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,620
because I definitely miss something but

782
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,179
really good call

783
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,100
all right so what happened was you know

784
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,559
I obviously followed up and I said hey

785
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,179
if you look at the time again it's a

786
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,320
little bit on that side because email

787
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,059
threads right

788
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,100
um if you see the time that kept keeps

789
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,580
me awake so 12 21. I said request to

790
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,520
reopen the ticket number X

791
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,500
because I've not received an official

792
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,500
reply to blah blah blah right and I also

793
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,820
somebody said responsible disclosure

794
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,740
extremely good call because that's I

795
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,320
reminded them of that there is

796
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,179
let's think about this for a second a

797
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:37,679
bit more seriously

798
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,899
we just talked about the market we just

799
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,340
talked about it's a multi-billion dollar

800
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,559
industry there are millions of units out

801
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,700
there

802
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,679
we should take this stuff seriously

803
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,600
I don't mean to talk anything negative

804
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,039
about this vendor or anything else it's

805
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,279
all for fun right but in general right I

806
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,260
would expect prompt response dialogue

807
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,419
all of that

808
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,200
what happened next

809
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,120
close again that's a good call

810
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,559
fix the issue and gave you some bug

811
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,720
Bounty money

812
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,279
at least at least the latter part I

813
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,419
don't know about the first part right

814
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,940
maybe the issue is fixed uh we'll see

815
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,919
we'll see in Fallen flights but I didn't

816
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,000
receive any conversation yet

817
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,299
so after a while after a while and I say

818
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,279
why because see the date I got an

819
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,539
acknowledgment a good one because I was

820
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,000
following up I again this is all for

821
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
humor right I don't mean to demean any

822
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,419
vendor here right just just so people

823
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,600
know but the timeline is pretty critical

824
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,380
right so at after close to a month right

825
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,899
you get a knack and I and I have some

826
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,940
explanation this is good this is

827
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,679
actually good I I wanted something like

828
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:47,940
this

829
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,980
but look at the part that's red

830
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,919
it says at the end it says yes we

831
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,200
implemented using xmpp which some of you

832
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,700
folks kind of recognized through the

833
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,640
slides says which is an older model

834
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,559
I don't know what's old and what's new

835
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,240
because I just bought the bot and I

836
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,559
wanted it to work the way it's supposed

837
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,140
to work all our new models now use more

838
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,659
secure technology to ensure user

839
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,820
information security

840
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,159
what do you mean by what do you mean by

841
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,820
use more secure technology to ensure I I

842
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,360
don't know I I had no idea right but

843
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,860
that got me worried because what about

844
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,200
the old models what about people who

845
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,940
bought the old model

846
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,539
are and don't know about these

847
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,159
right

848
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,559
I hope people can see the next slide

849
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,580
but what happened next

850
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,480
no guesses tired of guessing huh

851
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,380
sorry what was that close the ticket

852
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,080
um not completely I'm trying to recall

853
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,840
exactly yes they may have closed it but

854
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,179
I have to check my email thread again

855
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,520
um I wasn't satisfied with this to be

856
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,559
honest I love the response I like the

857
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,480
came back something substantial came

858
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,460
back right not just close the ticket but

859
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,960
I personally wasn't happy and I gave

860
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,580
them time so I really wanted to be

861
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,679
responsible and adhere to the

862
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,779
responsible disclosure time frame so I

863
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,760
said look 90 day 120 day whatever you

864
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,279
want I'm cool with that I mean today

865
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,500
it's two years almost

866
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,480
so three months later

867
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,460
I followed up but then I got a response

868
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,080
something like this right and look at

869
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,100
the time

870
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,659
February now we are in February we

871
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,399
started off in November

872
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,080
so somebody said Thank you right

873
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,399
somebody said they thanked you that's

874
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,159
also correct because they did right and

875
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,840
they passed on the team back passed on

876
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,760
my notes around hey I'm not happy with

877
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,519
this we need to CV a sign we need a cwe

878
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,140
something that shows this is

879
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,960
acknowledged right not just that email

880
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,299
I'm passing this note blah blah blah I

881
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,519
was fine I said okay I'm cool no worries

882
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,659
right

883
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,679
what happened next

884
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,100
I bought a new one I was buying Bots

885
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,900
sure

886
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,919
[Music]

887
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,120
sorry

888
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,740
nothing nothing

889
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,280
close enough

890
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,379
all right so

891
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,179
nothing really happened which is right

892
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,460
actually uh so you see me following up

893
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,060
on March 30th so just think about this

894
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,099
I'm not the first person who bought this

895
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,800
bot right I maybe have conducting This

896
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,839
research that's another story but I'm

897
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,699
working with them right now I'm not like

898
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,260
against anybody I'm working with them

899
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,359
I'm reporting responsibly trying to

900
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,940
understand and help out but we are at

901
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,379
March 30th

902
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,719
and I had to follow up a little bit more

903
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,859
strictly

904
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,480
right and say look

905
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,699
is there a response do we have something

906
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,379
assigned is somebody working on this if

907
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,960
so I'm fine I'll back off I I have no

908
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,179
issues right but I want something to be

909
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,080
done

910
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,580
and thank you

911
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,440
sure

912
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,599
find final takes on what happened next

913
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,859
because that's the final guess I won't

914
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:02,119
ask you guys to guess any further

915
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,240
they tried to run me over

916
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,339
oh my vacuum wow I'm really scared of

917
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,880
that guy now

918
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,740
so I again I I didn't do any public

919
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,140
disclosure I didn't I also have blanked

920
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,180
out their names right um I've done this

921
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,760
on my own no employers involved

922
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,040
I was very honest and transparent and I

923
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,480
reported it for good reason and like

924
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,480
with good faith right and even here I'm

925
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,160
not talking bad just just to be very

926
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,359
clear I'm not saying in a negative

927
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,579
manner I'm just saying this happens with

928
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,740
vendors and sometimes it's some of the

929
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,180
priorities right it's one person

930
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,160
reporting something like it it really

931
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,660
matters how you are responding and

932
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,579
prioritizing so I'm not saying it's all

933
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,140
of their fault but like for some

934
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,640
security issues we should be more

935
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,200
cognizant and that's really the message

936
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,020
right nothing really happened

937
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,119
so I had actually pulled back and I said

938
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,700
hey it's been like a lot of time in

939
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,619
seven six seven months I actually

940
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:01,440
started writing more emails

941
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,359
um seven months later I did get response

942
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,119
that says yes right and the the part

943
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,859
that I want everybody to focus is the

944
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,320
red part right so there's obviously a

945
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,380
date that's July right and there's

946
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,820
obviously escalations happening so look

947
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,180
I'm not I'm okay with the process but

948
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,940
I'm not okay with no work being done

949
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,640
so it got escalated

950
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,859
I would I would put it in a positive way

951
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,200
the the future Bots with the unknown

952
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,820
vendor here

953
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,140
they were better

954
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,660
right A lot of them did not have those

955
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,520
issues I was happy at the end I mean it

956
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,500
was an old one I understand but it's an

957
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,780
interesting case study you can pick one

958
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,880
up and test this out yourself right

959
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,680
and I didn't follow up after this it was

960
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,660
way too long it was kind of old several

961
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,579
years old I don't know how many people

962
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,859
use it but the objective is today's

963
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,440
awareness and not just raise awareness

964
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,240
you don't have to attend a talk to know

965
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,500
about this you can do it yourself

966
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,700
so in conclusion

967
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,619
I promise to end early so I'll stick to

968
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,060
that promise

969
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,640
um they might use vacuum boards like

970
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,920
other iot devices this again this is

971
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,599
nothing to do with specific vacuum watch

972
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,619
that can this can apply to your fridge

973
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,020
you know cameras anything right by

974
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,160
anybody

975
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,500
they may use insecure protocols

976
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,560
they may use insecure configurations

977
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,260
it's also very challenging for the end

978
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,359
user to get guarantees of privacy and

979
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,280
security I understand their pain points

980
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,260
I get it that's why I'm not complaining

981
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,880
too much about it I'm just saying hey we

982
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,040
can do a better job

983
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,440
the DIY method I described really that's

984
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,180
one of the main takeaways of this talk

985
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,579
is you can replicate this do-it-yourself

986
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,220
talk to people raise concerns I think

987
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,140
one way to really get the industry

988
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,420
moving is more people getting involved

989
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,060
and saying hey we should fix this now

990
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,660
right and finally again not finger

991
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,400
pointing but it's in general challenging

992
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,560
to get a response and also a response

993
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,640
and a fix

994
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,260
it's hard to fix these devices they're

995
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,140
everywhere like how do you tell how do

996
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,760
you follow up with a customer and say

997
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,500
hey like for that bot that you have

998
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,579
you're not going to give you a new one

999
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,520
it's hard to do logistically right it

1000
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,680
happens with cars there are recalls but

1001
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,359
like for Bots

1002
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,560
I've not seen them yet

1003
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,940
with that thank you everybody for

1004
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,320
listening thanks for keeping it clean

1005
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,960
and you can reach me at my website for

1006
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,339
yeah I have my LinkedIn Twitter

1007
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,079
everything

1008
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,730
thanks all

1009
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:37,079
[Applause]

1010
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,400
right

1011
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,260
any questions I do want to allow time

1012
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,040
for questions yes

1013
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,060
were they firm or available over the air

1014
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,760
so the question was were any of the Bots

1015
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,480
firmware updated over there yes uh there

1016
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,000
are some and actually that helps a lot

1017
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,240
what I didn't do is retest the same

1018
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,460
thing so it's definitely possible to

1019
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,140
your point and that's why I was not very

1020
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,760
negative or like trying to criticize

1021
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,980
anybody here some of them may have been

1022
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,680
fixed maybe I didn't hear back a lot of

1023
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,540
now vendors are following this method

1024
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,980
where they say oh look update available

1025
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,280
click update and you'll be fine

1026
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,680
um I just don't know whether each update

1027
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,140
has a security patch or they are just

1028
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,299
functionality improvements or bug fixes

1029
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,200
that should be another

1030
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,780
topic over the year updates that was a

1031
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,339
question I that's an interesting thank

1032
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,200
you I think I'll think about that I

1033
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,700
haven't done it yet

1034
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,760
but we could do that sober were they all

1035
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,460
plain text uh that's a good question yes

1036
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,440
a lot of them uh the question is I'll

1037
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,540
repeat for the recording did any of the

1038
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,400
Bots use SSL

1039
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,520
um I cannot say that specifically SSL

1040
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,140
but they were secure protocols in place

1041
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,180
for a lot of them so there there were

1042
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,099
times when I actually got a bot and I

1043
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,839
saw nothing on the network

1044
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,280
and it's very sad as a security

1045
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,500
researcher

1046
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,780
but that's a good thing right after that

1047
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,060
sadness passes away you're like good job

1048
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,579
so yes

1049
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:14,160
yeah so I I couldn't see that some of

1050
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,720
the slides curly enough for those

1051
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,900
packets UDP packets the slides which

1052
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,339
sorry I'll take you back sorry about

1053
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:21,440
that

1054
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,180
was there a lot of UDP that's the one

1055
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,839
yeah those are all UDP packets yes those

1056
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,460
are not even in fact it's kind of small

1057
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,200
that's why I was talking about it yes

1058
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,660
those are all UDP packets

1059
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,078
yeah

1060
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,040
I would be concerned if there were TCP

1061
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,359
in using video

1062
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,760
that's a lot of bandwidth and

1063
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,040
tissues

1064
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,579
anyway any final questions

1065
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,440
going once

1066
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,839
going twice

1067
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,259
sold

1068
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,699
[Applause]

1069
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,560
thank you for that talk it was super

1070
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,099
interesting I was
