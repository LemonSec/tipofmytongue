1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,299
hello my name is Casey Smith and the

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,280
title of this talk is cyber cartography

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,860
how to model cyber terrain this is

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,980
recorded for b-sides Boulder 2022 for

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,079
the virtual track hope everybody's doing

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,140
well and thanks to the organizers for

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,640
giving us a chance to present virtually

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,560
not all of us could be there but hope to

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,820
to meet up with everybody soon

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,199
so you can connect with me on Twitter at

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,840
sub T thanks for watching uh and or

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,759
watching either at the event or later on

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,460
I appreciate it and this talk will be

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,739
some of it's speculative and really just

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,899
trying to drive curiosity and Innovation

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,600
so feedback welcome and I look forward

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,320
to hearing from you

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,879
really three big ideas that I wanted to

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,180
cover in this and they are first is our

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,340
models versus reality how how are how do

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,800
we use models how do they affect our

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,320
perceptions or experiences how do they

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,820
align with reality how do we update

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,539
models secondly uh the idea that defense

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,519
and offensive tools need the same

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,380
perspective and that makes things better

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,960
overall over time

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,180
third is combining things and learning

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,799
from other disciplines or other domains

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,140
so how can we draw from domains like

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,500
medicine uh you know meteorology and how

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,119
can that inform our cyber security

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,220
processes and models

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,740
and then lastly along the way some case

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,840
studies and references that may be

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
helpful for you if you like this

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
so these are some things I've been

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,080
working on over the last few months and

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,520
so I always like this far side cartoon

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,320
where these two spiders have this web

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,119
across the slide and they basically say

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,799
if we you know if we pull this off we'll

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
eat like kings so if I pull this off uh

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,020
it you will be at a minimum entertained

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,700
and hopefully find some useful content

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,100
so I want to start with a map so

47
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,960
some of you will recognize when you see

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,000
this map immediately where this is or

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,100
you may even be able to quickly

50
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,220
translate that to what it might look

51
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,439
like over the horizon if you were to to

52
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,240
be standing at a point on this map and

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,699
see it others of us it might take more

54
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,700
context or more perspective so

55
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,500
when you think about Maps we could look

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,700
at this and we can see things like

57
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,300
bodies of water uh various slopes or

58
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,819
steepness or grade of the terrain we

59
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,480
could see maybe communities and Roads so

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
but it may not be enough to help us form

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,959
a really clear picture of what this

62
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,580
would look like so we may need

63
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,420
additional context so how about now does

64
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,480
that help at all provide any context

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,120
some of you are thinking no not even a

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
little bit so

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,900
you know what about now sort of like if

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,580
you've gone to the eye doctor where they

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,340
changed the lintus which is clearer so

70
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,220
this is Mount Albert the tallest 14er in

71
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,019
the state of Colorado this is a

72
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,060
prospective uh sort of standing on the

73
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,580
road looking to the West uh just south

74
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,019
of Leadville

75
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,780
and the reason I bring this up is it's

76
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,400
important when we're describing a thing

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,459
that we use maps but maps are a

78
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,160
reduction or an abstraction and so the

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,519
map is not the territory excuse me and

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,800
it may take multiple perspectives to get

81
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,420
the ground truth so the first part of

82
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,980
this is really to drive that point home

83
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,319
how we use these models versus an

84
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,620
experience of a particular thing

85
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,440
another example I want to use is if I

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,280
were to present this music to you what

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,099
does this sound like what what do you

88
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,260
hear when you read this and I know that

89
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,360
may sound funny but some some people are

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,819
trained and can actually instantly pick

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,860
this out and hear this playing in their

92
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,799
mind others of us need to need to

93
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,019
actually hear the music and then we can

94
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,879
start to see the patterns in the notes

95
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,819
on the page so I'm going to try and get

96
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,620
this to play real quick and see if this

97
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,440
helps identify this

98
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
foreign

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,530
[Music]

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,279
okay hopefully that helps identify the

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,918
song as Thunderstruck the soundtrack for

102
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,560
hacking of course that's debatable but

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,120
according to at least one news article

104
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,720
that's fact so anyway the idea though is

105
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,300
some of us can look at that and and see

106
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,919
that I can't but some people can look at

107
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,199
that and and hear that song all those of

108
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,580
us need to hear the song and then we

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,979
could recognize the patterns uh in the

110
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,100
model or in the sheet music so music can

111
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,080
be transferred across time and location

112
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,440
by writing it down uh and then I someone

113
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,780
can put that on on a instrument and

114
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,400
begin playing that by reading the music

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
other of us have to hear it others of us

116
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
experience it so again the sheet music

117
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,280
is not the song

118
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,340
the menu is not the meal right so models

119
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,979
are always an abstraction of reality so

120
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,360
they help us describe things talk about

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,820
things but it is very different than the

122
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,500
experience itself

123
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,660
one of my favorite examples of this is

124
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,780
from the movie Titanic where early on in

125
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,280
the movie there's a uh one of the

126
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,800
analysts is describing using the model

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
and simulation how the Titanic broke

128
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,080
apart so he's describing what happens

129
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,500
and uh and then the ship splits and and

130
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,060
sinks and you know and then at the end

131
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,639
he says pretty cool huh he's talking to

132
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,220
Rose of course who was on the Titanic

133
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,759
when it sank and she sees it responds uh

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,320
thank you for that fine forensic

135
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,780
analysis Mr Bodine of course the

136
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,840
experience was somewhat different so for

137
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,220
those people who have been through an

138
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,080
incident who have had their organization

139
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
attacked or have worked on incident

140
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,220
response they read threat reports very

141
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,680
differently than those of us who may not

142
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,180
have experienced that same situation

143
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,699
there's a lot of things happening that

144
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,100
aren't captured or cataloged right how

145
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,500
were emotions for the team what were

146
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,120
tensions like what was communication

147
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,520
like those aren't always captured and

148
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
don't come out as opposed to those of us

149
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,460
who read those Sports and they're like

150
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,259
oh they dropped the sign driver an

151
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,360
elevated privilege is pretty cool right

152
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,580
maybe but if you experienced it and it

153
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,199
affected an outage in your organization

154
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,500
may not be so just remember the model or

155
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,419
map of a threat report there are people

156
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,240
and organizations impacted by that

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
actual report

158
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
so when we look at models from miter

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,319
like attack and defend these are a great

160
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,600
way like music to in my opinion to

161
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
communicate a taxonomy communicate

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
things across time so it helps us look

163
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,780
at something and say okay they did a

164
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,160
scheduled task or they did this

165
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,440
particular technique but again think I

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,660
think of these as recipes right these

167
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,660
are not the meal these are these are

168
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,819
a way of describing something but there

169
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,800
could be things we learn as we draw

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
closer to the reality and the whole

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
situation much like the Mountaintop we

172
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
can be looking at a map it's different

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,660
than standing at the base and looking at

174
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,780
the actual event

175
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,400
so if you're not familiar with defend

176
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,979
minor defend is a relative newcomer to

177
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,500
matrices or taxonomies for various

178
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,240
attack patterns and defending against

179
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,479
those some of these we would recognize

180
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,160
very quickly like say multi-factor

181
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,800
authentication others of us would be

182
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,720
terrified trying to inventory system

183
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,060
firmware on all these devices and trying

184
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,280
to understand how to defend that but the

185
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,080
idea is it gives us at least a place

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,840
where we can work from a measure of the

187
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,580
terrain and know how we can improve so

188
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,840
these are really great hopefully you

189
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,580
don't hear that I I don't like these I'm

190
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,160
just trying to share how I think about

191
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,160
these models sometimes

192
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,560
another very popular model is minor

193
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,479
attack and there's a matrix for various

194
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,060
Cloud mobile these are really good at

195
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,099
describing across the top these are the

196
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,740
goals of the adversary so the adversary

197
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,560
wants to achieve persistence at the top

198
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,020
and how they would do that might be by

199
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,759
going up the stack or using one of the

200
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,400
items in that column to achieve that

201
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,860
particular

202
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,620
tactic so inside of each of these these

203
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,120
are very helpful but again they don't

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,620
necessarily describe the way we

205
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,000
understand them when someone's

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,520
describing supply chain compromise

207
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,199
I might think about that differently

208
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,259
than you do and so also keep in mind

209
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,900
this is very much like the model we have

210
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,400
for Sheet Music some people can look at

211
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,620
this and just play that attack out in

212
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,560
their mind other of us other others of

213
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,660
us need more context to understand what

214
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,419
happened and to draw a new insight and

215
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,659
observation to what happened

216
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,640
so you might have a situation where on

217
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
the left you see these are these are the

218
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,599
directions the attackers went on the

219
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,159
right The Blue Team scrambling or

220
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,680
incident response teams scrambling there

221
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
may have been a few points where those

222
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,339
intersected over time where we may have

223
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,920
been able to disrupt or prevent or block

224
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,080
Downstream Effects by the attacker but

225
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,540
overall sometimes they're not things

226
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,760
aren't as neat and they don't resolve

227
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,940
into boxes uh as easily so keep that in

228
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,000
mind as we go through this talk

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,220
so you'll see various models presented

230
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,140
for an intrusion

231
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,620
that are well organized and cyclical and

232
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,620
you know attackers don't do uh internal

233
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,600
Recon unless they've done initial Recon

234
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,459
for example so

235
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,800
um that is one way to think about it

236
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,540
another way might be there are a lot of

237
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,240
entry points there's a lot of messiness

238
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,940
to corporate and small business networks

239
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,160
and there's a lot of places attackers

240
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,860
could start and move what's important

241
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,019
though is we have a an understanding or

242
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,459
language this is actually from Matthew

243
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,800
Monty's book network attack and defense

244
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,779
is a very good resource if you haven't

245
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,339
read it I'd highly encourage you to take

246
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,019
a look but a real operation may look

247
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,240
very different from a defender or even

248
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,240
from an attacker's perspective

249
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,880
it's never as clean and easy as a simple

250
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,620
spreadsheet

251
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,200
so that's part one uh really talking

252
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,260
about how we think about models and how

253
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,480
they affect reality you know the map is

254
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,459
not the territory there's a clear

255
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,500
distinction between the two the next

256
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,700
section I want to talk a little bit

257
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,240
about is how offense and defensive tools

258
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,580
need to share the same view and once

259
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,040
that happens both attackers and

260
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,540
Defenders can start drawing the same

261
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,420
conclusions or observations about what's

262
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,360
happening and so if either side has

263
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,120
uh an information asymmetry here that

264
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,500
may help them right they may have a tool

265
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,760
to see something that the Defenders

266
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,980
simply don't or they may be aware of a

267
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,959
blind spot in a tool that a Defender is

268
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,120
not aware of

269
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,100
so I use this example I'll call it

270
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,200
cyberball it's essentially a soccer

271
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,959
field on the left a basketball court on

272
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,540
the right and over on the left-hand side

273
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,459
these are Defender rules there's a lot

274
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,800
of meetings there's a lot of can't pick

275
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,380
up the ball with your hands uh there's

276
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,940
different you know a goalie that's

277
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,100
guarding the the net

278
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,260
but over on the right an attacker has

279
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,180
really is none of these same constraints

280
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,440
they could pick up the ball by their

281
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,820
hands they could throw it around they

282
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,100
could kick it they can uh they're trying

283
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,959
to achieve a different objective than

284
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
what's happening on the left side

285
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
not a great analogy but this is

286
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,600
sometimes how I think about I see a lot

287
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,940
of attackers playing one game Defenders

288
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,620
playing another game attackers playing

289
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,260
the game of trying to achieve an

290
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,720
objective or hit a Target Defenders

291
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
trying to do log searches analytics and

292
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,640
and uh they don't always line up and so

293
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,779
it's almost like there's two different

294
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,940
planes so hopefully bringing these two

295
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,519
into alignment maybe at least is a

296
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,160
theory I have that might help

297
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,420
organizations Better understand and

298
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,839
model attacks and defense

299
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
so when we think about an event what

300
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,399
would an analyst need to see before an

301
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,220
event during an incident or after that

302
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,380
could help them understand it better

303
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,980
can we use that information to replay to

304
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,019
learn from for example why did it take

305
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,300
us five hours to get the logs maybe next

306
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,040
time it takes us an hour and a half next

307
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,959
time it takes us 30 minutes

308
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,000
is there a way to pause or look at our

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,240
Telemetry rewind even train people on

310
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,519
that so pause and analyst and ask you

311
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,959
know hey what would you do in this

312
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,360
situation uh give them a chance to think

313
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,339
about it and and play it out and see

314
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,600
what happens so that's where I think

315
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,459
models can help us ask these what-ifs

316
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,140
run through these scenarios help people

317
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,040
train

318
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,839
but we think differently about a map

319
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,300
when we're traveling than we do when

320
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,519
we're lost than when we're just sitting

321
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,160
at home uh and so different maps have

322
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,500
different utility or models have

323
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,760
different utility given the

324
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,380
circumstances or the event that you're

325
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,240
facing

326
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,940
as a Defender I want the same map that

327
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,220
the attacker has I want to know what

328
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,380
they're looking at and try and outpace

329
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,740
them or uh make decisions before they

330
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,720
make decisions on the same information

331
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
and cut off the attack so I might see

332
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,279
well it's pretty obvious they're going

333
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,860
to go after that bridge so we may want

334
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,720
to defend that area more heavily or

335
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,000
whatever we're talking about but I want

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,440
to hear the music I don't want to read

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,060
the music I want to have the experience

338
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,279
essentially that the attacker is having

339
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
and looking at the network from that

340
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,420
perspective to help inform where I need

341
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,060
to defend so what can they see what can

342
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,000
they touch or access those are the views

343
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,579
that I want so some of you have used

344
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,459
Cobalt strike before very popular red

345
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,200
team adversary emulation tool very

346
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,060
popular with actual adversaries as well

347
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,940
and this is just a screenshot from their

348
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,940
SMB lateral movement and you can see how

349
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,300
an attacker could track which systems

350
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
they've compromised you can see what the

351
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,579
Privileges like are they system are they

352
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,680
uh just a normal user

353
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,260
you can also track in the tool

354
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,540
credentials that you've collected over

355
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,240
time and from what source so this might

356
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
be how an adversary sees an engagement

357
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,899
and moves through a network and that may

358
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,160
be very different than the way a

359
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,300
Defender might see that same information

360
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,880
uh Raphael has a really good talk called

361
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,920
Flying a Cylon Raider encourage you to

362
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
check that out if you're interested

363
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,920
because he describes that sense of how

364
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,660
do I take an attacker's perspective how

365
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,139
do I look at an attacker's Tool uh and

366
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,420
use that to help inform defense so

367
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,300
really good stuff

368
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,279
one of the tools that I like that I

369
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,680
think it represents this really well is

370
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,660
a tool called Bloodhound and I think it

371
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,800
shows

372
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,380
very clearly the benefits of attackers

373
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,600
and Defenders having the same view

374
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,420
same information of a network and so

375
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,279
Bloodhound if you're not familiar with

376
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,260
the tool is a tool that allows you to

377
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,720
model active directory structures to

378
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,660
then find attack paths so maybe you're a

379
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,279
normal user and you want to elevate to

380
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,980
domain admin or maybe you have rights to

381
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,420
this group but you want to elevate to

382
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,740
another group it does it does quite a

383
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,300
bit more obviously so I put some

384
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,880
references here about how this tool has

385
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,500
really changed our industry in terms of

386
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,720
seeing active directory

387
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,240
and really a big shout out to Andy and

388
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,339
the team that's doing this work because

389
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:00,899
I think

390
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,240
The attacker's View and the defender's

391
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,639
view with Bloodhound is the same so the

392
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,620
idea is we're looking at the same data

393
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,380
and so we can draw conclusions about

394
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,000
what we need to defend and how we can

395
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,040
improve so if I can run Bloodhound as a

396
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,399
Defender before uh an adversary does I

397
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,959
may be able to quickly cut off places

398
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,399
where they could Elevate privileges

399
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,620
weaknesses we might have in our active

400
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,660
directory structure so

401
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,180
or configuration so so that to me that's

402
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,339
an example of offense and defense having

403
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,260
the same view and everyone getting

404
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,139
better over time so another tool might

405
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,060
be something like nmap to do Port

406
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,639
scanning or some some derivative of nmap

407
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,160
we're both using the same things to scan

408
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,079
for open Services try and fingerprint

409
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,240
targets that is helpful to both

410
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,040
attackers and Defenders so trying to

411
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,260
find those places where the tooling

412
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,420
provides the same visibility to both

413
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,760
sides and we're starting to see this

414
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,620
more I really like the team at Microsoft

415
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,579
that's doing some of these

416
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,160
visualizations so here you can see an

417
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,740
attack from ransomware and you can

418
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,420
actually start to see the flow of the

419
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,459
attack mapped to various techniques on

420
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,300
the right

421
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,160
but you begin to be able to understand

422
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,519
okay uh you know credentials cannot be

423
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,380
dumped until security controls are

424
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,540
turned off or until they elevate

425
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,279
privileges so we start to see the

426
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,820
ability to affect Downstream Behavior by

427
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,920
understanding the attack Flow versus

428
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,519
just a spreadsheet or a chart so now

429
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,980
we're starting to look for Trails uh on

430
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,660
the map as opposed to just looking at

431
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,360
the map together

432
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,760
another blog from Microsoft is showing a

433
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,959
similar thing now that all of a sudden

434
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,839
looks a lot closer to the Cobalt strike

435
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,820
view of the network

436
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,620
and we could start to think about oh

437
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,500
okay you know if the defender uh if they

438
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,420
hadn't been able to reach uh node two

439
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,040
then they wouldn't have nothing would

440
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,320
have happened after that so okay lesson

441
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
learned how do we iterate and improve so

442
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,720
that I think has been very valuable

443
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,399
for attackers and to finish that the

444
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,300
same view

445
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,860
and so there's some examples of this

446
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,420
that you can use to experiment there's

447
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,119
neo4j which is a lot of the Bloodhound

448
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,040
development

449
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,619
excuse me uh there's D3 for JavaScript

450
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,780
I'd encourage you to experiment and try

451
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,339
some of the different visualizations to

452
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,500
see what is surfaced or what

453
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,260
uh might make sense

454
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,640
there's quite a bit of templates and

455
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,099
models that you can use to see what

456
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,619
would happen and ask questions change

457
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,959
the state ask the question again you

458
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,120
know if we if we made this configuration

459
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,760
change how would that have affected this

460
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,559
incident you know maybe the whole thing

461
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,919
was uh you know predicated on one thing

462
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,440
being true and if that was taken away uh

463
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,700
everything would have collapsed and

464
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,960
that's how we can get better over time

465
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,520
by using these types of models to

466
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,900
understand that at least that's my

467
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,880
theory

468
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,860
so what kind of maps do we have what

469
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,660
kind of visualizations do we have in

470
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,240
other domains in other disciplines

471
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,280
you know how can we learn from those

472
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,720
other disciplines

473
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,280
what are the things that I think is

474
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
interesting that other disciplines do is

475
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,500
look at data across time so you

476
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,960
functionally have how could we model a

477
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
network or a device state or

478
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,260
configuration

479
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,840
over time and go back in time and look

480
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,760
at State roll forward in time and see

481
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,320
how changes play out

482
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,360
so if you think about meteorology or

483
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,360
weather models and data you can see

484
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,080
the value of these models is predictive

485
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,700
right so I want to know what's going to

486
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,260
happen on Friday so that I can make

487
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,080
plans today and so looking at various

488
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,080
trajectories inputs and knowing where

489
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,299
models work and where they feel so some

490
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,400
of you may be familiar with you know the

491
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,960
concept of long-term weather prediction

492
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,240
it's not possible I can't tell you what

493
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,860
the weather will be like

494
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,480
10 years from now but I can tell you

495
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,280
what it will be like 10 hours from now

496
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,320
so understanding the value of these

497
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,720
models and constantly changing inputs

498
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,100
and seeing how that affects different

499
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,380
things don't I don't have an answer of

500
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,120
what like a weather map would look like

501
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,340
in terms of of cyber security but that's

502
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,020
what I'm thinking about in terms of

503
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,660
visualizations collecting some of this

504
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,660
data and then looking at uh maybe what

505
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,000
it's telling us is going to happen or

506
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,419
could possibly happen in the future

507
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,000
but so a great example of where we do

508
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,059
actually use time and looking at data

509
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,760
across time is time travel debugging

510
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,520
this is my first experience of this was

511
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
from a talk by Brett Victor called

512
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,080
inventing on principle in 2011 and so he

513
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,179
was giving this presentation and he was

514
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,740
talking about how he was trying to get

515
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,620
his character to make a particular jump

516
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,440
and rather than trying to pick the

517
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,200
numbers he has a sliding bar but that

518
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,000
was still hard to see so what he did is

519
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,820
sort of turn on these Trails for the

520
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,620
the character

521
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,740
and he could actually by dragging the

522
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,020
trails up or down play out a different

523
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,660
future for the character until he got

524
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,600
the exact amount and so this has been

525
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
incorporated into a number of commercial

526
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,140
products I'll show you in a moment windy

527
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,299
bug a t train have both tools that use

528
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,240
time travel debugging and these These

529
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,720
are game changers for analysis because

530
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,580
you can change input you can you can

531
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,440
play out and exploit and roll something

532
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,320
back change the state play it forward

533
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,140
again and see the effect and that is

534
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,960
really remarkable so as we look at

535
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,120
weather and how weather patterns can

536
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,620
change over time we can look at the

537
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,720
state of things even within a system

538
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,240
even within a debugger and see how that

539
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,400
would play out over time so

540
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,140
when you think about reverse engineering

541
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,539
and debugging you know a developer a

542
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,980
reverse engineer they're trying to look

543
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,020
at the same data they're trying to see

544
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,240
the same things they use the same tools

545
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,960
so an exploit developer can use a windy

546
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,860
bug or other tools guidra Ida just like

547
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,440
a software developer could as well so

548
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,700
you can see here's an example from

549
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,220
windybug moving forward going back in

550
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,280
time and I think the real value is

551
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,100
seeing something play out back it up

552
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,320
change the state play it again and see

553
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
if it has a different outcome see if it

554
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,780
actually made a difference so

555
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,000
I like this slide a lot this is from

556
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,600
t-train's uh website and they do time

557
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,700
travel debugging and low-level analysis

558
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,320
for like kernel drivers and things like

559
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,780
that but you'll see here they can track

560
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,120
reads and writes of locations to memory

561
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,700
over time you can create bookmarks or uh

562
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,480
snapshots you can then Trace those to a

563
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,280
point in time where a write operation

564
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,200
corrupted something that caused a crash

565
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,720
and Trace that back over time and see

566
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,340
where it came from see that it actually

567
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,640
came from uh the ethernet interface so

568
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,100
these are things we haven't had so these

569
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,860
are new so new models new maps new tools

570
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,320
are going to give us new insight into

571
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,220
how to defend and also how to attack so

572
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,659
I like their stuff I think it's pretty

573
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,100
neat

574
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,380
another example that I've used is API

575
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,140
spy and if you've ever looked at a you

576
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,760
know you're in a debugger and you see a

577
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,200
create file

578
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,940
call and you're not sure what the

579
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,440
function parameters are so your context

580
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,799
switching between the msdn page and then

581
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,659
you know what are the inputs here what

582
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,059
does that structure look like I like API

583
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,740
spy because I can simply hover over that

584
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,900
function call and it will show me right

585
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,400
away oh okay I can see that first

586
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,740
parameter is a pointer to a string or

587
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,559
whatever it might be so that gives us a

588
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,659
lot quicker Insight a develop an

589
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,059
intuition for maybe what's happening as

590
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,159
we're troubleshooting something so some

591
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
of the best tools for troubleshooting

592
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,900
and debugging can be really helpful for

593
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,640
informing what we know about security

594
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,880
incidents and situations

595
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,460
how we see things then this is sort of

596
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,039
my point helps us make predictive and

597
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,400
analytical and strategic decisions so if

598
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,020
an attacker is seeing something that I

599
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,280
don't see they may make a different

600
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,559
decision than I might make and so while

601
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,000
there's always that element of human

602
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,700
adaptation and Innovation

603
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,640
um we want to be more informed than the

604
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,140
adversary we want to know things that

605
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,240
they may try we may want to anticipate

606
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,700
or disrupt their attack early in the

607
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,320
chain and we can't do that if we're

608
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,840
looking at a map of Paris you know

609
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,220
trying to defend Texas okay so uh

610
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,260
what we can we can predict where things

611
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,840
are going our models can inform us uh

612
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,880
you know what questions we need to ask

613
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,620
Etc

614
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,900
so one of my favorite tools uh for web

615
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,220
application testing some of you are

616
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,720
familiar with this would be is burp

617
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,059
suite and I love the burp Suite

618
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,799
interface the the plugins the whole

619
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,020
thing it's just very elegant and it

620
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,940
allows me to then see the request and

621
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,460
the response parse the headers look at

622
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,280
different parameters we play attacks

623
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,280
uh fuzz or inject things at a particular

624
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,780
point in time

625
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,740
very very powerful offensive Tool uh to

626
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,600
to go look at and start testing web

627
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,480
applications there are other web proxies

628
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,320
that inspect data like Fiddler uh o wasp

629
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,240
zap proxy uh Charles proxy uh mitm and

630
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,159
in Python

631
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,100
but this is an example of seeing the

632
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,919
data and then that informs our defense

633
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,380
so by running scans and running attacks

634
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,020
you know we might see that oh for this

635
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,700
particular method call if I just count

636
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,640
the Response Code so Response Code 500

637
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,679
means the application couldn't handle it

638
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,620
and something crashed in either the gvm

639
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,140
or the the web server so those are

640
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,059
important and we can see an asymmetry

641
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,100
here between you know get requests

642
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,620
causing a 500 or a crash versus get

643
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,620
request causing a 200 and we may want to

644
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,659
look into that so I guess my point being

645
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,720
here is I would really like my wife to

646
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,179
look more like burp Suite right so if

647
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,799
those are two different tools or

648
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,360
whatever you're using to defend your

649
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,200
website the closer uh the view of you

650
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
know can come to looking more like an

651
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
offensive security tool I think we're

652
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,620
going to see dramatic improvements and

653
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,880
insights we're already starting to see

654
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,860
that people using application monitoring

655
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,860
data to help inform their defenses so we

656
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,960
could look at got a parameter

657
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,780
over time and say like it's only ever a

658
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,400
date if it's something other than a date

659
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,220
whether it's a semicolon or a apostrophe

660
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,679
just kill the connection because I know

661
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,140
that field should have always parse or

662
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,900
why you know why is it a date 99 of the

663
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,159
time and now all of a sudden it's

664
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,000
adjacent objects or yaml so that tells

665
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,440
me something's happening there either a

666
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,240
misconfiguration or somebody is sending

667
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,940
those events so anyway hopefully that

668
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,679
make you make it gets the point across

669
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,659
like as a defender of web applications

670
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,120
one of the advantages you have is all

671
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,279
testing and all attacks are for the most

672
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,020
part visible if you're have the right

673
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,240
verbosity and logs turned on so you get

674
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
to see all the failed attempts before

675
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,799
the attacker actually may succeed not

676
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,279
often but uh sometimes so

677
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,779
another

678
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,880
um example for you just I'll just leave

679
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,860
this up here for you uh to reference

680
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,860
this is a visualization tool using kitra

681
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,159
and it allows this situation the

682
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,640
analysts to really just scan through the

683
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,659
data

684
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,640
and all of a sudden some things start to

685
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,059
to pop out uh as or that maybe that's an

686
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,760
image maybe maybe that's another type of

687
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,100
structure that's just a text string but

688
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,500
then we're leveraging the power of the

689
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,720
you know human brain to see the patterns

690
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,559
here

691
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,080
while the computer can then surface the

692
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,080
data so sort of combining the two

693
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,460
strengths of both the computer analytics

694
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,679
and the human pattern recognition to

695
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,480
find something in a file that we may not

696
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,220
that may have been difficult to to find

697
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,980
otherwise

698
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,380
and if you like adversarial thinking or

699
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,700
red teaming

700
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,559
you can use this same approach as well

701
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,059
you can think about well what does a

702
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,559
Defender see what would they actually

703
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,620
observe and I like this painting called

704
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,679
Another World from MC Escher which shows

705
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,840
three different perspectives the same

706
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,600
frame but it actually takes your brain a

707
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,039
little bit of time if you pause the

708
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,200
video and try and figure out am I

709
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,480
looking I'm looking up but I am am I on

710
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,799
the left or am I on the right and I'm

711
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,539
looking down and am I on the right or

712
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:13,919
the left and so

713
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,900
those kind of contexts which is slow us

714
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,480
down can slow us down and so how can we

715
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,159
accelerate that but you might think

716
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,980
about as an adversary uh emulation team

717
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,539
or red team like what would a Defender

718
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,460
see here and how could I

719
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,039
either try and camouflage my activity or

720
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,700
how could I you know try and blend in

721
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,340
so when we talk about other domains

722
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,679
disciplines so what what can meteorology

723
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,080
teach us about you know cyber security

724
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
what can an astronomer teach us about

725
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,419
cyber security so you think about that

726
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:46,860
for just a moment some of you will

727
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,779
recognize where I'm going with that the

728
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,179
idea was from the book cuckoo's egg

729
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,419
where Cliff Stole was a astronomer that

730
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,659
was called in to respond or essentially

731
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,400
ended up responding to a pretty major

732
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,559
cyber event in the late 80s it's really

733
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,179
good read lots of good history a lot of

734
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,919
good approach and techniques there but

735
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,020
we can learn a lot from other domains

736
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,220
whether it's meteorology astronomy or

737
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,200
excuse me medical Aviation Public Safety

738
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,659
all those a lot of these problems people

739
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,539
have solved that we may not be aware of

740
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:19,919
and there may be techniques we could use

741
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,659
and apply to cyber security in the

742
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,240
models we use in the database service

743
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,179
so another reference is Carmen Medina's

744
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,760
talk uh keynote that she did about

745
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,520
diversity of thought and inclusion and

746
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,260
different perspectives on solving

747
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,720
problems and she mentions one of the

748
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,080
astronomers here Cecilia who

749
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,640
by looking at things like photographs

750
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,940
from telescopes was able to infer makeup

751
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,400
of stars and it's really fascinating

752
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,860
look not only at the science but also

753
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,720
just uh you know what she had to

754
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,100
overcome to

755
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,860
to understand and and reach those

756
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,220
conclusions so the way the way we look

757
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,380
at things and understand data may give

758
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,539
us new insights so in this particular

759
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:05,159
part of the talk Karma was talking about

760
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,140
the benefits of combining

761
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,179
telescopes and photography because up to

762
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,159
that point it was just somebody's

763
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,980
you know uh someone's word that they saw

764
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,539
this thing at a particular time but with

765
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,520
a photograph or a recording they were

766
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,740
able to then other people could study it

767
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,260
and draw other conclusions

768
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,140
so how does that help us with models and

769
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,299
cyber terrain well we may if we think

770
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,760
about telescopes and photography you

771
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,220
know what do we need to combine uh with

772
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,320
cyber so I you know I don't know this is

773
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,360
just an open question but like you know

774
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,799
what how could you combine cyber

775
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,960
security with Zillow or something you

776
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,000
know or or how could you combine it with

777
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,179
a recipe site or drone perspectives or

778
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,059
whatever you bring to the industry and

779
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,039
your perspective may be really valuable

780
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,480
for us because we may be missing

781
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,340
something but things that might help us

782
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,779
think about this be like what takes a

783
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,700
lot of time today what's expensive today

784
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,120
what's tedious or error prone today how

785
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,460
do we reduce that improve that improve

786
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,860
the quality those types of things we may

787
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,980
draw from other domains so

788
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,020
some of you may have heard of the ooda

789
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,000
loop and some of you may roll your eyes

790
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,940
and stay with me but the idea of the

791
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,559
ooda loop here is

792
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,200
observe Orient decide and act and so

793
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,380
this originated in the Air Force pilots

794
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,480
looking at how to become better pilots

795
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,840
and how to win uh in dogfights and how

796
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,840
to gain an advantage over adversaries

797
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,880
and and some theories are a lot of it's

798
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,860
related to like the canopy or the bubble

799
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,640
Pilots had a different view than their

800
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,220
opponents and so this old movie from uh

801
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,899
with Clint Eastwood the original Firefox

802
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,299
if you remember you know he has to steal

803
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:46,919
this plane and in order to do that he

804
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,039
has to think in Russian uh so pretty

805
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,559
cool you know original Firefox before

806
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,440
the browser but the idea here is

807
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,600
UDA is probably best experienced and

808
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,520
taught it's sort of like trying to

809
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,260
describe to you how to play the piano

810
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,020
versus letting you play the piano and

811
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,399
see what that's like and then you'll

812
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,980
begin to to build repetition so let me

813
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,059
try and

814
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,820
explain that how I think about UDA and

815
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,279
how I think about faster Loops so going

816
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,980
faster from observe to act

817
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,620
is how I interpret that and and that

818
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,020
improves that our Speed and Agility as

819
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,679
Defender so one problem that you might

820
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,539
have is imagine you're a large

821
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,720
organization and you identify in your

822
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,480
proxy server logs a malicious domain was

823
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,059
detected somebody tried to browse to a

824
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,220
malicious domain so now you have a lot

825
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,380
of questions and how fast you answer

826
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,700
those questions May inform the scale and

827
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,960
size and duration of the incident so

828
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,000
once you understand there's a malicious

829
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,860
domain in your logs you have to ask how

830
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,740
did it get there which hosts performed

831
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,700
the lookup

832
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,340
you know was it just a lookup of a DNS

833
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,960
name or did someone actually send an

834
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,320
HTTP request to that domain and if if it

835
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,360
was a lookup who performed the lookup a

836
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,600
proxy server or a domain controller

837
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,399
um there's a lot of questions right and

838
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,200
so then we may want to go back and say

839
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,299
all right now that I know that it was

840
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,299
computer a what was the process name on

841
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,220
computer a that performed the lookup was

842
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,679
it a browser was it maybe just a you

843
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,240
know someone typed something in wrong

844
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,039
was it an injected ad or was it SVC host

845
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:31,140
what's the user agent if it's an HTTP

846
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,880
request there's a lot of things here

847
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,640
just by seeing a malicious domain in

848
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,080
your proxy logs you have to go answer

849
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,640
and then once you've answered one and

850
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,659
two

851
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,720
you now have to sweep the organization

852
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,039
and answer that for all of your hosts

853
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,659
has anyone else talked to this domain

854
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,640
has any other process talked to this

855
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,679
domain and then you repeat that cycle

856
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,100
and so that's the loop right that's the

857
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,039
observed act and so by doing that in 12

858
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,880
seconds versus 12 hours how quickly can

859
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,700
you reboot eradicate clean up machines

860
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,799
versus something that may have persisted

861
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,679
in your network for a very long time so

862
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,720
by increasing the speed that our

863
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,299
questions are answered we can influence

864
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,100
our ability to defend the organization

865
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,620
so that's how I interpret uh some of the

866
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,779
UDA models and things like that I see

867
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,640
value in it but I see value in it in

868
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
terms of

869
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,120
doing it instead of just trying to

870
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,559
describe it so

871
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,700
but

872
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,980
by understanding how quickly you can

873
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,019
answer questions that

874
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,539
makes you faster right so if I can pick

875
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:37,260
up an enemy uh aircraft 12 miles before

876
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,080
they see me that may change you know

877
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,100
right that all of a sudden you start

878
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,140
thinking of where this comes from that

879
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,080
may change how we react so the speed

880
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,179
with which you ask and answer questions

881
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:51,480
may affect outcomes of incidents both at

882
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,419
attacker or Defender and asking and

883
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,399
answering faster than an adversary may

884
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,840
be something that you'll strive for how

885
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,640
quickly could we answer that question

886
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,740
what tool do we need what do we need to

887
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,140
turn on in our logging to be able to do

888
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,480
that faster so

889
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,219
so that's Buddha if I think about

890
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,580
observe Orient decide and act it's a lot

891
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,040
easier to do it but also if you break it

892
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,659
down then you can ask how could we do

893
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,940
this faster

894
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,040
so what's an example of this maybe

895
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,560
that's where EDR uh could help you right

896
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,599
so you have a tool that now tracks every

897
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,520
computer every process and every domain

898
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,659
they've talked to and now you can answer

899
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,520
the question in 12 seconds versus 12

900
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,560
hours versus 12 days

901
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,960
so that's where I'm going with these

902
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,239
tools can and models can help us improve

903
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,699
our defense overall

904
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,500
back to earlier when we were talking

905
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,300
about drawing on other disciplines so if

906
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,520
we think about like telescopes and

907
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,560
photography being combined what could we

908
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,199
combine EDR with so EDR by itself could

909
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,719
actually maybe be a force multiplier if

910
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,520
we combined it with something else so

911
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,619
what about fraud analytics and this is

912
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,300
just pure speculation but you could say

913
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,400
like you know how when I buy a credit

914
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,380
card you know buy something and it's not

915
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,300
me the bank calls me or sends me a text

916
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,820
and I say nope that wasn't me what if

917
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,859
that was possible with EDR so what if

918
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:11,700
you know your EDR system detected wmi

919
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,800
spawning a command prompt and the user

920
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,720
got a push notification hey are you

921
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,060
running command no

922
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,339
how quickly could you then react or

923
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,380
respond check with the user give them a

924
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,460
call so the the data then can be uh

925
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,680
inform us and that model that helps us

926
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,780
get really quick so we can deny the

927
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,820
transaction in a few seconds or we can

928
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,220
recognize this holiday season and yes

929
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,099
that person's buying a TV or it's the

930
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,440
end of cycle maintenance and yes they're

931
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,140
running wmi and we get better over time

932
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,880
but just simply asking a question might

933
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,200
be a way to improve the process so

934
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,720
hopefully that makes sense so just just

935
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,700
combining ideas like that like how could

936
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,660
we you know use a fraud notification in

937
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,000
the financial industry and combine that

938
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,020
with endpoint telemetry I don't know

939
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,619
another thing you might do is enrich the

940
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,480
context or the data that you're

941
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,060
presenting so if you look at a other

942
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,460
graphs you might just see nodes but here

943
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,280
an analyst can actually see a keyed map

944
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,140
and they can actually see

945
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,359
the data oh all right that's a file

946
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,700
right that's a file modification that's

947
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,579
a process spawning a network connection

948
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,960
so by seeing the relationships and

949
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,060
quickly understanding that may help an

950
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,060
analyst pivot to another tool that shows

951
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,220
them oh I need to go look for any exe

952
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,160
file in the app data local temp file or

953
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,380
with the name temp in it or maybe I need

954
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,540
to go look for any executable that has a

955
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,420
single letter so like show me every

956
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,579
executable that has like e dot exe

957
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,940
almost always evil so that is from JP

958
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,500
cert they have a tool called syspon

959
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,680
search that kind of enriches the view so

960
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,320
trying to draw from different

961
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,040
visualizations we've looked at

962
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,440
Bloodhound active directory we've looked

963
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,020
at debuggers we've looked at burp Suite

964
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,640
looking at endpoint data so hopefully

965
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,920
this is connecting with maybe some of

966
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,839
you different visualizations of giving

967
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,099
you ideas

968
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,560
about how these maps and models improve

969
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,720
our understanding

970
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,780
I like this one uh from Edward Tufts he

971
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,460
has a class I'll reference at the end

972
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,740
about data visualization and modeling

973
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,260
and so what we want to teach folks or

974
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,480
what I what I think we

975
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,240
want to teach people is how to react and

976
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,760
adapt to situations and use the tools

977
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,560
that they have so if the thing I like

978
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,140
about this is here here I am looking at

979
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,540
the dishwasher Matrix and I if I have a

980
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,119
number five tablespoon in my hand I

981
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,500
don't know where it goes there's nothing

982
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,720
on this it tells me so what do I do with

983
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,700
this tablespoon that doesn't fit the the

984
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,680
grid and so

985
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,079
that can help us

986
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,300
you know how we're using the tools so I

987
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,599
much more want as a senior or principal

988
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,520
and training new analysts I want them to

989
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,920
be able to adapt and react much more

990
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,000
like

991
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,099
um maybe a surgeon does

992
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,800
where we're training them you know

993
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
C1 teach one do one so to speak where

994
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,540
they're getting the Hands-On practice

995
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,339
maybe guided or in a controlled

996
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:14,160
environment but it's not enough just to

997
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,720
give someone a matrix and just say go

998
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,359
hunt it's just like giving somebody uh

999
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,520
an anatomy chart and saying go do heart

1000
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,040
surgery so there's got to be a way to

1001
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,599
train people there's got to be a way to

1002
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,160
use these models to help people learn

1003
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,560
over time one of the books I like is by

1004
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,660
Dr Atul gawande who wrote a book called

1005
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,280
complications that he actually wrote

1006
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,320
while he was a Surgical Intern that

1007
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,820
talks about this it talks about the

1008
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,400
challenges but we need to teach people

1009
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,220
to to do the work and be able to adapt

1010
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,380
and provide feedback if the tool is not

1011
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,480
working that needs to be something that

1012
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,040
they can provide to us so again trying

1013
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,800
to draw from a domain like medical

1014
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,359
training or surgical training how might

1015
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,579
that inform how we train security

1016
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,740
analysts we don't just turn them loose

1017
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,839
there's more of an apprenticeship and

1018
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,660
working together to both learn because

1019
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,839
the senior or principal or role can

1020
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,460
learn from someone with new perspective

1021
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,079
they could be like why it takes you like

1022
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,720
seven steps to copy the you know event

1023
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,820
log domain into the Sim why don't you

1024
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,099
just do this so it's mutually beneficial

1025
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,660
so

1026
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,579
uh or building muscle memory so if you

1027
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,440
remember in the Karate Kid towards the

1028
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,440
end early in the movie rather uh Daniel

1029
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,599
has been doing all these this work he's

1030
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,940
been sanding floors waxing cars painting

1031
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,619
fences he doesn't really understand why

1032
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,380
he's doing these various things until Mr

1033
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,359
Miyagi starts doing punches and kicks at

1034
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,480
him and he realizes he's learned by wax

1035
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,720
on wax off he's developed muscle memory

1036
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,180
to respond and react to these things so

1037
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,460
we work on the models we study and

1038
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,079
understand but ultimately it's the

1039
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,940
experience of the thing that is going to

1040
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,640
be how we use these and how they help

1041
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,859
make us better and improve our

1042
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:55,079
understanding so

1043
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,380
okay so some closing thoughts uh our

1044
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,540
tools our Maps our models they matter

1045
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,339
we've covered a lot of ground we've

1046
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:03,900
talked about how the map is not the

1047
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,300
territory we talked about combining

1048
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,280
tools so offense and defense have the

1049
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,380
same view we talked about different

1050
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,180
Industries at different parts of cyber

1051
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,920
security where that's true things like

1052
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,520
debuggers time travel debugging uh web

1053
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,140
application attack tools Bloodhound Etc

1054
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,540
I want to close with this and I think

1055
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,579
this is an important concept is that you

1056
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,440
get what you measure is a quote from

1057
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,160
Richard Hamming and essentially he tells

1058
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,560
the story where the fishermen go out and

1059
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,560
they catch fish in the Nets and every

1060
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,500
they conclude that there are no fish

1061
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,760
smaller than a particular size because

1062
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,280
they've never seen them in the net and

1063
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,380
so the takeaway here is the instrument

1064
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,420
affects what you see

1065
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,020
the size of your net is going to affect

1066
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,900
the size of the fish you can catch

1067
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,060
um seems obvious sometimes we forget it

1068
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,740
hopefully that's a good reminder and

1069
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,780
another quote I like from Carmen Medina

1070
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,599
is our ability to know as a function of

1071
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,240
our tools for knowing so our ability to

1072
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,520
combine telescopes and photography is

1073
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,020
going to improve our understanding over

1074
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,820
time our ability to take cyber security

1075
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,260
tools and models and map them over time

1076
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,900
helps us see things so

1077
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,940
okay we covered a lot of ground thank

1078
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,740
you for uh bearing with me through that

1079
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,839
hopefully this was informative there's

1080
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,579
some references for minor attack and

1081
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,760
defend uh one of the plugins in miter

1082
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,859
calderas game board which is trying to

1083
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:33,300
do something very similar to what we

1084
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,040
describe where offense and defense have

1085
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,800
the same picture and a lot of my

1086
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,980
thinking and ideas that around these

1087
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,780
visualization came from a class that I

1088
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,180
took uh Edward Tufts course on

1089
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,820
visualization is outstanding if you want

1090
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,160
to take it it's super fun and hopefully

1091
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,680
we'll we'll bring new ideas so looking

1092
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,079
forward to those of you who are new to

1093
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,880
the industry and those of you who are

1094
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,240
seasoned veterans how what we can do to

1095
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,980
learn from each other and draw from

1096
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,440
various domains so thank you for your

1097
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,480
time and I look forward to seeing you

1098
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,740
all in person and hopefully you'll have

1099
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,819
a good rest of the event
