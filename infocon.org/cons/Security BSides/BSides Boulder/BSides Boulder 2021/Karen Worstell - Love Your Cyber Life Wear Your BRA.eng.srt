22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,079
as we come to the end of the

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,680
presentation if you have any thoughts or

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
questions i'd be happy to answer

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,600
any questions that you have so

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
many years ago i stood in the produce

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:56,879
section

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,280
at the local market looking for apples

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,799
apples apples apples where were the

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,119
affordable apples

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,200
because you see i had a two-year-old and

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,479
a five-year-old

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,600
and i had 13 dollars in my pocket to

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,199
last me for the next two weeks

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
49 cent per pound apples which seems

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,000
like such a bargain today

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,200
they were completely out of reach and

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
in desperation i swallowed what was

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,759
left of my pride and i went to the

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
produce manager to ask him

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
if he had any apples that he had pulled

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
from the shelf that he'd be willing to

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
sell to me for a discount

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,119
and it was so it's so vivid in my mind

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:45,759
right now

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,880
remembering that still

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,399
small voice of inner wisdom that i could

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:52,960
hear

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
that said there has to be a better way

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
than this

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,320
and you can do this

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
so about that same time my biggest ally

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,360
my

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,640
big geeky hacker brother michael

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,199
he came over to my house and across my

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
kitchen table

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,160
he spread out a trs-80 model one

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,680
computer with a serial number of six

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
and said to me sister

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
you need to learn to code

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
well i'm a 98 percent

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
left-brained creative i studied music

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
performance

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,120
and i did that until my early 20s i

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,360
thought when i was young i would grow up

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,120
and design ball gowns for barbie dolls

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
i designed and sewed all my own clothes

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,720
all the way through college

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,120
and i had managed to get undergraduate

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
degrees in chemistry and biology through

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
sheer will and hard work

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,840
but still this whoring blinking

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
machine intimidated me i was sure that

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,720
if i did something

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,000
wrong typed in something wrong it would

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
go up in smoke so i finally sat at that

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
keyboard and tentatively

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,360
typed in the words h-e-l-l-o

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
hit enter and nothing bad happened

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800
that blinking nine inch monitor with

81
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,360
that

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,280
amber cursor it just kept blinking at me

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,000
and all the various ribbons and cables

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,040
and components

85
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,720
just sat there so

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,959
with michael's help i learned to program

87
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,440
and go beyond playing games i started

88
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,599
programming in visual basic

89
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,840
and then i taught myself a programming

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,040
language called fourth

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
and i loved programming and i found out

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,680
i was really good at it

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
so when the local graduate school opened

94
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,720
up a program

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,799
in computer science for a master's

96
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,319
degree

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,799
that's when i heard that voice again and

98
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,400
it said

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,280
you can do this

100
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,879
so have you ever had that experience

101
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,200
when you had kind of that heartfelt

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,239
inspiration about something that you

103
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,399
knew could happen something that you

104
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,279
knew you could do

105
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,478
and then your head starts all kinds of

106
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,680
noise

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,919
some people call it imposter syndrome

108
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,040
for me

109
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
my head got super noisy and it sounded

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,800
like this

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,360
i thought you wanted to be a good mother

112
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,440
don't forget you have a two-year-old and

113
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
a three-year-old

114
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
by the way you have zero money

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,360
and you suck at math

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,960
which i kind of do so to make a long

117
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,320
story shorter i applied

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,880
i got in two years later i graduated

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
from university with my master's degree

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,639
in computer science

121
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
my first job happened before i finished

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
my thesis

123
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
as a security analyst and 15 years later

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,919
i left my job as the chief information

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,199
security officer at microsoft

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
to start my own cyber security

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,919
consultancy and share my lessons learned

128
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
and experiences toward a more inclusive

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,160
work culture where everyone

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,520
has voice and an impact

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
so you may think this is an

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
extraordinary journey from a broke mom

133
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
of toddlers to a chief information

134
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,520
security officer with of multiple

135
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,240
iconic brands like microsoft at t

136
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
russell investments

137
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,880
but what i know for sure is that just

138
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,720
like all of you

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
this journey happened one ordinary day

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
at a time

141
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
it took an unshakeable belief in that

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,880
still

143
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,759
small voice that carried me through it

144
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,520
all

145
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,880
and it took up showing up every day

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,160
even when things got tough and as i look

147
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,360
back on it

148
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
it took a lot of allyship

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,759
starting with my big brother michael

150
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,039
people who believed in me and held me up

151
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,919
people who made it possible for me to go

152
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,400
even

153
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,560
further to go to university as a broke

154
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
mom of toddlers

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,840
and to help make sure my kids were cared

156
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,160
for

157
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,639
that path to the top of my profession in

158
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,160
large part

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
happened because of three things that

160
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,280
i'm going to talk to you about today

161
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
whenever it got tough these three things

162
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
helped me

163
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,919
they helped me by reminding me

164
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,080
it can be better than this and you can

165
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,479
do this

166
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,919
so today i'm here to share with you

167
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,680
those three things because

168
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,039
tech can be far better than it is

169
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
now and i believe with all my heart that

170
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,160
it is within your power and mine

171
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
to make it so you see

172
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
tech suffers from a lack of diversity

173
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,280
it's a la

174
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
and a lack of inclusion and a lack of

175
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
equity

176
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,319
30 years ago when i got my master's

177
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,240
degree women were 34

178
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,479
of the computing workforce today that

179
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,520
number is far

180
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,319
south of the 23 percent that it

181
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,280
officially hit

182
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,560
in 2016 when the aauw

183
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
published its report on women in stem

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
called why so few

185
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,800
every area of stem over the last 30

186
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,280
years

187
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,759
has shown growth in diversity and

188
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,479
inclusion

189
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,479
except computing and the huge question

190
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,440
for me

191
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,759
when i learned that fact was why

192
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,800
part of my path to that understanding

193
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,680
inc

194
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,720
you know it includes what seems like a

195
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,879
huge detour

196
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,360
but in hindsight now it makes perfect

197
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,080
sense because

198
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,120
at the time that that report came out i

199
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,639
was a chaplain

200
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,520
i had just completed 2 000 hours of

201
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
clinically supervised

202
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
training in pastoral care in addition to

203
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,599
another master's degree

204
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,440
and i was serving as the palliative care

205
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,919
fellow at the va hospital in portland

206
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,400
throughout my time as a chaplain one of

207
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,199
the things

208
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
that i noticed was that i had seen

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,879
firsthand

210
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
the similarities between the distress in

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
people

212
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,400
in the tech sector and distress

213
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,360
of families and patients in crisis and

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
there's a principle in chaplaincy called

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
the principle of proximity and what that

216
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,039
basically says

217
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,519
is that the chaplain does not sit in her

218
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,440
foxhole

219
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
or her or i'm sorry the chaplain does

220
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,679
not sit in her field tent

221
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,920
waiting for the front line to come and

222
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
make an appointment

223
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
she goes and sits with the front line in

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,959
the foxhole

225
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,600
and my foxhole is in tech

226
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,320
my still small voice said to me again

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,080
tech is your foxhole

228
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
it can be better than this you can do

229
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
this and so i left

230
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
made the decision at that time when i

231
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,959
learned this information

232
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,320
about parity inequity and inclusion

233
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,200
in tech and left the chaplaincy and came

234
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,320
back to tech

235
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,839
and i returned with a big hairy

236
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,160
audacious goal to create a more

237
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,519
inclusive work environment

238
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,560
and to reverse the trend of women and

239
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,040
under

240
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,120
underrepresented groups leaving tech in

241
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,959
my lifetime

242
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,399
so these facts are current i'll give you

243
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,920
a few facts and then we're going to dive

244
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,240
into the three things

245
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
six percent of partner level pay in big

246
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
tech goes to women

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,279
this pattern carries across all of tech

248
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,320
in a meal a meloo that author emily

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,360
chain calls

250
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,720
brotopia it's a symptom of a culture

251
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
that doesn't value the voices of people

252
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
who are different than the decision

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
makers at the top

254
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,200
life cycle processes in hr are designed

255
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,519
unfortunately to reinforce

256
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
the existing dominant culture and you

257
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,000
if you have differences must fit

258
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,160
in i do an exercise in all of my

259
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
workshops that sounds like this

260
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
it's it's kind of designed to make

261
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
everyone feel equally uncomfortable

262
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,079
right at the beginning and break the ice

263
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,200
but i have

264
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
everyone walk around the room three

265
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,279
times the first time we walk around the

266
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:27,839
room

267
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,480
we walk around the room as ourselves the

268
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,760
second time people walk

269
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,800
around the room i ask them to do so

270
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
by embodying the energy that is the

271
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
opposite of what they

272
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
embodied when they walked around the

273
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
room the first time

274
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
and the third time we walk around the

275
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,279
room we're not supposed to walk around

276
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,160
the room as

277
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
anything and be completely neutral

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
and when we debrief when this is over

279
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
the feedback that i always get

280
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
with every single group is that walking

281
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,440
around the room

282
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
the first time as ourselves feels great

283
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
the second time we walk around the room

284
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,279
everyone spends about 30 to 50 percent

285
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,760
of their

286
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,480
energy trying to figure out who they're

287
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,079
supposed to be

288
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,000
and the third time they walk around the

289
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,120
room people use

290
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,680
the language like all the energy went

291
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,200
out of the room

292
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,000
we looked like zombies time slowed down

293
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
and my answer to that is welcome to

294
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,680
corporate

295
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,760
america because you see

296
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,480
we don't create an environment where

297
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,760
people can bring

298
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,240
all of their variety and all of their

299
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,959
rainbow

300
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,279
and all of their diversity into the

301
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,399
workplace

302
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,519
and shine and create

303
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,959
the kind of work environment where

304
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
creativity and innovation really thrives

305
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
what we do is we create a corporate

306
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
blender where everyone comes in with all

307
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,519
of their variety

308
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,920
we put you all in because to fit you

309
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,560
must

310
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,600
blend to bland beige

311
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
right so

312
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
let's get to why we're going to talk

313
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,279
about what we're going to talk about

314
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:09,839
today

315
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,519
because here's the truth when we

316
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,560
lift one up all rise

317
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
so when we embrace the benefit of

318
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,959
inclusion

319
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,920
in the cyber business it's equivalent to

320
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,959
promoting

321
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,200
creativity innovation and diversity of

322
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,959
thought that will help us

323
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,880
in this asymmetric war that we're

324
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,639
fighting right now

325
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,000
and that's eating our lunch so this is

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,519
our foxhole we're in it together

327
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,200
it matters for all of us in cyber

328
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
security because creating a workplace

329
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,959
where everyone has a voice is the right

330
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,518
thing to do

331
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,639
and because we cannot begin to address

332
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,160
the challenges that we

333
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
face in cyber today with when our

334
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
community is disengaged out of

335
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
frustration

336
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,000
for the next little bit i'm going to

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,920
show these three pillars that you can do

338
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,959
right now

339
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,040
every day and that will make a

340
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,480
difference

341
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,959
three things belief resilience

342
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,320
and allyship and yes

343
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,760
that spells bra

344
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
in case you wondered where that came

345
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,120
from the first pillar

346
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
in the difference that you can make is

347
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
belief when megan came to

348
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
our two-day intensive that we do she was

349
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
a senior software engineer

350
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
and her experience led her to believe

351
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
that it was best to

352
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,720
fly under the radar she was frustrated

353
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,360
that

354
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,279
although she was considered a high

355
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
potential employee

356
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,519
she did not receive the visibility

357
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,440
opportunities or compensation that her

358
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,959
work deserved

359
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,839
and after our two-day intensive this is

360
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,360
what she wrote

361
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,680
i have a renewed sense of self-awareness

362
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,959
and confidence

363
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,639
and i've learned that my professional

364
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,639
self-worth listen to this very important

365
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,199
is in no way dependent

366
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,600
on what i am able to accomplish how

367
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,720
productive i am

368
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
or how others perceive me i've also

369
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,639
learned that the true value in making

370
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,839
genuine connection is with is making

371
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
genuine connection with the people that

372
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
i work with

373
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,880
and that i don't need to do it all on my

374
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
own

375
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,959
and get by on mere merit and solid work

376
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,199
ethic

377
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
i'm much more likely to ask questions

378
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,800
contribute in meetings and admit that i

379
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,480
don't understand something and talk to

380
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,199
people

381
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,120
about my work experience and how things

382
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
are going with me

383
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,279
i'm a lot more confident in my skill set

384
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,880
and i'm better at reading

385
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,040
my own emotional state and attempting to

386
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,240
read others

387
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
i'm much more comfortable with reaching

388
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,920
out to people

389
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,880
those are megan's words when we believe

390
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,199
we can make a difference

391
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,959
we do this was not something that we did

392
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,920
to fix

393
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,920
megan she already had all of the ability

394
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,360
to make this happen

395
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,480
it just took a little bit of a reset the

396
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,279
mindset

397
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,440
reset that happened with megan was

398
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,760
almost instantaneous

399
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
she influenced her she went on to

400
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
influence her leadership

401
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
she helped shift the culture got

402
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
visibility

403
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
got a promotion and a degree of

404
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
assurance

405
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,279
that was incredibly self-satisfying for

406
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,199
her career

407
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,120
the power of belief to make a difference

408
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,160
is a hope that comes deep

409
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,519
from your own inner wisdom just like

410
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,320
the inner wisdom that spoke to me at

411
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,279
that very beginning of that journey

412
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,160
unlocking that power of that belief

413
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
comes from knowing how to listen

414
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,120
to that inner voice and believing it

415
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,399
so why don't we do this all the time

416
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,600
because most of the time we as cyber

417
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,399
people

418
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
are all up in our heads we deal with

419
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,120
systems and data and facts and metrics

420
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
and when you're in your head it's very

421
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,320
hard to pay attention

422
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
to that still small voice believing in

423
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
the difference you will make

424
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,000
begins with knowing your inner self your

425
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
in and knowing

426
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,440
that your unique inner wisdom is

427
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,360
powerful

428
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,279
listen to it make room every day for

429
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
what i call the download

430
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,480
and setting aside the to-do list and the

431
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,040
head

432
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,639
noise and just listen

433
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
so what is your inner voice saying to

434
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,399
you right now

435
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,839
besides when is she going to finish her

436
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,000
i invite you to take a moment and listen

437
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,279
and record

438
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,320
a voice note on your smartphone

439
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
when this talk is over and capture that

440
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
get accustomed to listening to your own

441
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,319
smooth voice the voice of your heart and

442
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,039
capture

443
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,839
that each time without judgment and

444
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,119
without all the noise from your head

445
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,280
it is it telling it is telling you

446
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
something important

447
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,760
and at the end of the week with all of

448
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
these notes you've captured review them

449
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,000
do you see a pattern

450
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
do use any particular message really

451
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
stand out

452
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
so that's all i have to say about belief

453
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
let's move on to the next topic

454
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
in our three points the r in bra

455
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,360
stands for resilience

456
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,960
resilience is basically the ability to

457
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,679
get up

458
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,520
one more time than you've been knocked

459
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,559
down in its simplest form

460
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,120
it's easy to say and it takes being

461
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,919
brave

462
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,320
it takes courage it takes knowing

463
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,440
yourself

464
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
well enough that you don't believe the

465
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
fake news that your own

466
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,559
inner your own head tells you about what

467
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,679
other people think of you

468
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,160
this is the antidote to imposter

469
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,400
syndrome by the way

470
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,799
it means not succumbing to imposter

471
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,559
syndrome it means

472
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,880
that feeling it means overcoming that

473
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
feeling that once people find out who

474
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,799
you really are they won't support you

475
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,280
anymore

476
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,720
resilience takes knowing the warning

477
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,240
signs of burnout

478
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,880
of knowing when you are just surviving

479
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,160
and not thriving

480
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,840
it takes courage to take time

481
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
for self-care for fueling your brain and

482
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,520
your body

483
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,039
in the best possible way and resilience

484
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,160
is the courage to say at the end of each

485
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,440
day

486
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,799
i will try again tomorrow

487
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,120
in our five day online challenge called

488
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,600
that we call flame proof

489
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
which is another word for personal

490
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
resilience i

491
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
walk you through the five steps that

492
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
could change your life

493
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,440
and not only help you but help your team

494
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,160
a rock star senior engineer recently did

495
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,440
the program and

496
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,720
wrote this to me just yesterday

497
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,039
i was stuck in a vicious burnout funk

498
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
and miss warstell's flame proof your

499
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,440
career reignited and energized my

500
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
motivation to focus on priorities and

501
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,400
goals

502
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,679
in my professional and personal life

503
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,360
considering the insightful lectures

504
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,640
combined with exercises that elicit

505
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,960
self-exploration

506
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,039
i highly recommend the course the

507
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,960
journey allowed me to develop the skills

508
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
necessary to evaluate my needs and

509
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,880
desires

510
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,039
such that i could identify and realize

511
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,840
career ambitions in a healthy fashion

512
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,559
and while ensuring i took care of myself

513
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,559
and my family

514
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,520

520
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
on linkedin following the presentation i

521
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
would love to hear from you and connect

522
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,280
there

523
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
let's talk just a little bit more about

524
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,720
burnout for a minute

525
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,919
do you know the number one no i always

526
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,600
ask this of cyber people

527
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,400
do you know the number one sign of

528
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,000
burnout in an organization

529
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
it's cynicism right

530
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
cynical jokes in cyber security by the

531
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,120
way are the best but

532
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,280
cynicism is born from a wounded place

533
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,360
cynicism comes from life experience that

534
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,280
was traumatic or deeply disappointing

535
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,480
and we all have that

536
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,600
for many people cynicism is

537
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,720
the protective mechanism that's not

538
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,159
rational

539
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,440
but it goes like this if i expect that

540
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,919
people

541
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,960
are self-serving self-interested and

542
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
incompetent

543
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,799
i won't ever be sucker-punched by

544
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,600
trusting

545
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,360
someone who will only let me down

546
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,479
that's cynicism

547
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,320
have you ever heard that in your

548
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
organization

549
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,480
let me tell you this

550
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,760
the big problem with cynicism

551
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,360
is that it's contagious

552
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,480
cynicism its impact on organization is

553
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
like pouring gasoline on a campfire in a

554
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
bone-dry grass line

555
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,799
grassland during a chinook wind we are

556
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,159
most often willing to believe the

557
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:38,880
negative

558
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,039
and not shift perspective to look for

559
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,960
the positive

560
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
i have an exercise i call turn it and

561
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
turn it and

562
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,760
the next time you see something that

563
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,919
seems very much out of character

564
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,679
ask yourself this question what's up

565
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,720
with that don't get mad get curious

566
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,799
take the decision and turn it around and

567
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,400
examine every possible

568
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,120
angle of it so that you can understand

569
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,640
why the decision was made

570
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,600
the way it was all right quickly let's

571
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,280
talk about allyship i know i'm running

572
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,960
out of time here so i just took a look

573
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,080
at the clock

574
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,280
ally ship is the third component in bra

575
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,640
allyship but and uh uh and at the rsa

576
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,280
conference in 2018 we used b and ally as

577
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,400
our hashtag

578
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
it actually trended and and i thought

579
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,120
this was really pretty incredible

580
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,640
until somebody turned around and say you

581
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
know you can read that multiple ways

582
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,559
and i was like uh

583
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,679
right so i don't know if you see it

584
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,320
but we're talking about be an ally not

585
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,559
the other ways that you can read

586
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,240
that hashtag allyship is a new term and

587
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
a lot of meaning is poured into it by

588
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,039
different people

589
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,240
and you may not agree with some of it

590
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,240
here's how i use allyship very quickly

591
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
when a very well-known first century

592
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,400
jewish teacher walked the earth he was

593
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,840
asked the question what is the most

594
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
important law for us to keep

595
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,559
i'll paraphrase it like this the most

596
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,679
important law

597
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,600
law is to love the creator with all

598
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,679
you've got and the second most

599
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,720
important law is just like it and that

600
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,039
is to love your neighbor as yourself

601
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,000
so the attributes are of the creator

602
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,640
that we

603
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
all could we all possess and can

604
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
practice every day our mercy

605
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,600
graciousness

606
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,120
slow to anger kindness truthfulness

607
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,840
being forgiving compassionate and

608
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,600
just

609
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
that my friends is allyship

610
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
i want you to fill your cup with these

611
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,760
attributes

612
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,799
that you possess so that

613
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,840
you have the opportunity to share them

614
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,320
with the people around you

615
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,799
and on those days when it doesn't work

616
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,480
ask yourself

617
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,279

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,679
uh so we have a question from aaron

647
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,600
what should we be looking for in someone

648
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,960
who isn't reaching out

649
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,799
that needs help

650
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,039
well what should you be looking for in

651
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,480
someone who needs help

652
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,440
and they're not reaching out and um i i

653
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,279
would say

654
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,240
um well you've already seen something

655
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,480
because you believe they need help

656
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,000
and they're not reaching out um and your

657
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,360
allyship in that situation is one i

658
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
think of kindness right

659
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,600
so when you can reach out to someone and

660
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,799
say hey

661
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,080
i just want to check in with you how

662
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,840
it's how's it going this just happened

663
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,320
to me

664
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,960
a couple of days ago because i had a tip

665
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
that someone really needed to hear

666
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,080
a word of kindness and they were at a

667
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
conference actually

668
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,720
and i texted them and said how's it

669
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,919
going

670
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,080
and i didn't hear back so i picked up

671
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,840
the phone and called them

672
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,279
and just said hey i've been thinking

673
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,559
about you and i really want to chat

674
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,080
how's it going

675
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,520
and so you can you know don't ever be

676
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,159
afraid

677
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,520
i think we all kind of have this

678
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
nervousness that we're poking our face

679
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
into something where we don't belong um

680
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,159
but you be brave you know the worst

681
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,440
thing that can happen is they

682
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,480
ask us to go away um

683
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,840
at least you've done your kindness part

684
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,360
to reach out i hope that helps

685
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
be sure to damn me on linkedin too if

686
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,440
you have any questions following up from

687
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,400
this i'll be

688
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,559
happy to answer anything that i get in

689
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,600
the next week or so

690
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
uh see we have another question from

691
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,240
slammer uh

692
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
do you have methods to rescue those that

693
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,559
have burnt out and left the community

694
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,480
wow um so

695
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,600
in the five-day online course and i'm

696
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,159
not here

697
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,000
trying to push that but one of the

698
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
things that i

699
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,559
emphasize in that is the one of the

700
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,320
reasons we burn out and i've been there

701
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
twice

702
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,200
so i'm kind of a slow learner sometimes

703
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,000
i guess

704
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,799
but um that one of the things that's

705
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,760
very helpful

706
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,159
is to know what you want and to be

707
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,919
willing to set the boundaries

708
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,399
around that that will help you make sure

709
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,679
that that happens

710
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,399
and to show to know in a in a very clear

711
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,039
way

712
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,159
that you're working every single week on

713
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,919
something that contributes to those

714
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,120
goals of yours that are very important

715
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
so as an example one of the goals that i

716
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,360
set for myself and it was an

717
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
important one for me to set and be very

718
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,720
explicit about

719
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,120
because i was always so busy working

720
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,159
which was

721
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,440
i would i create um

722
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,399
amazing experiences and memories with my

723
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,120
family and my loved ones

724
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,960
that means that every week i take time

725
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
uh if not every day but it's usually not

726
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,240
every day

727
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,080
um to do something about that goal

728
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
right even if it's making a great dinner

729
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,080
or whatever it's something that i'm

730
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
doing and i can tell myself at the end

731
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,520
of every week that i am working on the

732
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
things that are important to me

733
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,320
there's a lot more about that um in the

734
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,600
course but that's

735
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
one of the ways to do it is to know what

736
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,799
you want

737
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,720
and make sure that you're setting

738
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
boundaries that make sure that you can

739
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,840
do them

740
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,399
thanks see we have another question from

741
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,520
aaron

742
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,480
um yes what can we do to create a more

743
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
inclusive community

744
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,039
for underrepresented individuals

745
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,279
wow thank you for asking that question

746
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,039
um we have so much work to do

747
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,240
um tech is not tech is a place where

748
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,679
we're moving at a very very fast rate

749
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,399
and in order to move very quickly what

750
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,559
we tend to do is self-select people who

751
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,039
are like

752
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,799
us who think like us who make decisions

753
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
like us and

754
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,080
we have to be willing to be patient

755
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,279
for a process where communications of

756
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,640
diverse

757
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,799
ways of communicating whether a person

758
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,200
is neurodiverse or ethnically diverse or

759
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,720
gender diverse

760
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,840
how do we listen to them

761
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,200
how do we seek to understand because

762
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,919
it takes time to do that you will 100

763
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,480
percent

764
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,520
always get better solutions and better

765
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,240
decisions

766
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,559
if you take that time but it's

767
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,159
frustrating for us i think the number

768
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,399
one thing we can all do is learn

769
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,720
to slow down just a little bit i i

770
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
always kind of

771
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
use the phrase you know slow is smooth

772
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,640
and smooth as fast

773
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,880
take the time to be slow because you'll

774
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,840
go much faster in the long run

775
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,720
thank you i think we might have one more

776
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,360
question

777
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,399
uh oh we do

778
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,120
uh how can a company be more inclusive

779
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,840
to parents

780
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,640
i love that question um so

781
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,520
not just parents but also people who are

782
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,200
caring for elders

783
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
right because i did that five times

784
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,440
while i was in cyber security

785
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,240
um and uh i'm about to go back into

786
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,159
cyber security again for the first time

787
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,440
without children or

788
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,760
grown-ups to take care of um

789
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,520
having on-site child care wow like

790
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,159
if i had a way if if i had to go into

791
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,240
the office how i could have

792
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,279
um child care now in work from home

793
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,760
we've really highlighted how hard it is

794
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,200
for people who

795
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,200
are caring for family members at home

796
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,679
to be able to concentrate and focus and

797
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,960
i think we just

798
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,640
we fundamentally have to change the way

799
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,960
we think about the workplace and

800
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,919
um having those conversations those are

801
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,640
fairly brave conversations to have

802
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,399
um i think people are going to be a

803
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,399
little bit afraid that they'll be seen

804
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,039
as asking for special accommodations or

805
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,320
whatever but

806
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,440
um you know start if it's not happening

807
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,039
in your workplace already start the

808
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,039
conversation

809
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,960
and and and let's be really clear

810
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,960
about how hard work from home has been

811
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,480
for anyone who is it's been hard for

812
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,039
everybody

813
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,039
in different ways but for family members

814
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,200
it's been particularly difficult

815
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,559
and we lost we lost 10 percent

816
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,320
of the women in the tech workforce

817
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,880
due to work from home during the

818
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,399
pandemic

819
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,120
it set us back it set us back

820
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,960
dramatically

821
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,120
in terms of any kind of progress towards

822
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,799
equity in the workplace

823
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,799
because so many people had to drop out

824
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,159
it's

825
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,159
i think the thing right now is just to

826
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,360
make sure that the conversation doesn't

827
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,399
doesn't go silent about how important it

828
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,240
is for us to make sure that we value

829
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,519
families

830
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,480
um extended families and you know every

831
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
variety of family

832
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,200
while we're trying to all make a great

833
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,799
tech workplace

834
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,840
thank you for asking the question

835
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,159
okay still i see a little bit more

836
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,600
activity in the channel so i'll see if

837
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,320
there's another question coming

838
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,240
huh we do have another question uh so

839
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,080
this is from punk coder

840
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,880
uh how do we bring along management that

841
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,480
are not fully on track

842
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,799
with dei oh yeah

843
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,200
i i don't have a great answer for that

844
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,440
um and if you just take a look at what's

845
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,080
happening

846
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,360
at uh some of the

847
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,559
big tech firms right now well even

848
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,640
this has been going on for for decades

849
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,600
but the

850
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,880
the um the culture does not favor

851
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,600
diversity equity and inclusion just as i

852
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,799
talked about and

853
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,640
some companies are making a difference

854
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,880
intel is a good one vmware is a good one

855
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,320
right there's companies that are really

856
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,880
working on it for those companies that

857
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,279
are not

858
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,399
there is cultural shift that needs to be

859
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,159
happening and the only way that's going

860
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,080
to really really change

861
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,000
is when the message is coming down from

862
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,120
the top

863
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,559
it's very hard to do culture change from

864
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,039
the bottom or from anywhere in the

865
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,080
middle

866
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,158
so my suggestion is

867
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,919
it's conversation it has to be really

868
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,760
brave conversation if you've got

869
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,679
individuals who they may have a blind

870
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,239
spot let me give you some hope with that

871
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,119
i had two managers one time this wasn't

872
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,960
about diversity equity and inclusion but

873
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,760
i had two

874
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,320
managers both of them women directors in

875
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,599
my organization

876
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,480
who needed to me to hear something they

877
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,839
had to say to me

878
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,839
because i was interfering in their jobs

879
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,359
in a way that was making it hard for

880
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,280
them to lead their organization

881
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,918
i was blind to this they sat down one

882
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,000
day and they said we have to talk to you

883
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,760
and they very bravely kind of laid it on

884
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,359
the line is like this is what you're

885
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,199
really really good at we want you to do

886
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,040
more of that we want you to stop

887
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,359
doing this because it's making our jobs

888
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,399
hard

889
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,000
and i was blown away by

890
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,520
their courage and

891
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,839
um and we were able to work out that

892
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,200
difference because they were truly

893
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
speaking to my blind spot

894
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,680
so you kind of have to gauge the person

895
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,880
if this is

896
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,599
something where they just it's a belief

897
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,640
system

898
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,119
and they bel they actually don't believe

899
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,400
in dei

900
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,680
then you're going to have a harder time

901
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,160
because

902
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,720
poking at somebody's belief systems is

903
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,200
is a

904
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,320
very difficult thing to do but if you

905
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,599
have someone

906
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,880
who just has a blind spot and you can

907
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,720
shed some light on that i think that's a

908
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,400
very good thing to do

909
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,680
i hope that helps it's hard when that

910
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,399
that's the case

911
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
and i guess i have a brief follow-up to

912
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
that um

913
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,079
do you think uh how do you think the

914
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,599
approach for di

915
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,640
like can that look different at

916
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,440
different companies

917
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,440
well yeah i think

918
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,079
when you when you say dei it means

919
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,480
different things to different people

920
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,720
right and having an a

921
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,280
at the end of the day here's what i

922
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,480
found most helpful about dei

923
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,079
at a high level when intel made the

924
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,800
decision

925
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
that they were their internal workforce

926
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,680
was going to reflect their customer base

927
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
and demographics

928
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,040
they got very intentional about how they

929
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,839
were going to

930
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,680
um rebalance their workforce

931
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,960
and one of the things that they found

932
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
as they were doing that and this is

933
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,079
where our phrase about when we lift one

934
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,040
all rise

935
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,280
comes from is from the intel experience

936
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,200
because when intel did that

937
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
what one of the things that happened was

938
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,160
you know they had 50 say they have 50

939
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,640
white men in the organization and what

940
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,520
they found

941
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,200
was for the first time in the

942
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,839
organization their voice was being heard

943
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,960
the big benefit of inclusion

944
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
is not that we're hitting certain

945
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,240
numbers

946
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,320
the benefit of inclusion is that

947
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,560
everybody's voice gets heard no matter

948
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,000
who they are and there isn't

949
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
a weight given to somebody because

950
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,720
of a particular class gender

951
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,440
whatever that might be that they're and

952
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,960
we don't really have

953
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,000
meritocracy we haven't achieved that

954
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,320
i think we even have a podcast out there

955
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,040
called meritocracy is dead

956
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,920
but but the truth of it is is that if

957
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,599
you can

958
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,880
uh this is the practice that has to

959
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,320
start with each one of us and this is

960
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,400
why on our podcast we talk about making

961
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
the workplace

962
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,440
making the tech workplace better from

963
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,960
the inside out the inside is here

964
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,000
we all can do a piece and the way we can

965
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,880
do the piece

966
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,000
is to make sure that we learn how

967
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,440
to help other voices be heard

968
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,880
and you know dei

969
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,160
is driven by lots of different motives

970
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,680
and lots of different pieces of the

971
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,040
organization

972
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
it's going to be different things in

973
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,880
different places but at the end of the

974
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,680
day

975
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,640
it is how do we show up in my book

976
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,760
allyship

977
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,680
dei shows up as how do we show up with

being slow being patient right being

980

being compassionate how do we show up

982

983
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,680
our own cup so that we're able to fill

984
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,520
