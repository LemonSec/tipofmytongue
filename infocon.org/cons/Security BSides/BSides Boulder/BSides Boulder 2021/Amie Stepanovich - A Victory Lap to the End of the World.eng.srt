her talk is a victory lap to the end of

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,840
the world about government hacking so

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,960
amy please uh take it away

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,199
thanks so much will what a wonderful

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,600
introduction that was way too kind

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,280
um i am going to pull up

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,440
some slides hopefully the right tab yes

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
i got it right the first time

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
um so thank you all for having me and

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
letting me talk and present to you all

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
on

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
government hacking and more specifically

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,159
um the recent um incident around the

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
microsoft

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,960
exchange server um this is me

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,880
i as will said i'm the executive

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,320
director for the silicon flat iron

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
center i worked previously at epic

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,960
and at access now and a few years ago i

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,560
authored a report called the human

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
rights response to government hacking

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
where i was i felt really lucky that my

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,240
employer gave me an opportunity to spend

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,280
some time

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
deep diving into the history of

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,439
government hacking not only in the u.s

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
but all over the world and looking at

50
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,720
what had happened previously what we

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,399
knew about it what we didn't know about

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,799
it um and comparing it

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
to human rights standards and how

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,560
the operations had met or more often

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
than not not met human rights standards

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
and what we ended up doing is setting

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,199
out a framework with 10 different

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,920
principles that we thought should govern

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
government hacking operations it was a

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,200
pretty stringent

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,680
set of principles admittedly but really

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
government surveillance tends to fall i

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,520
think

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
quite frequently as somebody who does

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,720
human rights on the side of not

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,800
respecting human rights

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
way too often so we wanted to provide

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
that other side

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
of things and i think throughout my talk

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,720
you'll you'll start to understand why

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
um so what i'm going to do today is i

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,200
kind of want to

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,160
to go backward in time a little bit and

74
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,640
um

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,120
to start at the beginning of of the

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,080
conversation

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
around um enhanced what i'll call

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,879
enhanced government surveillance in the

79
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,239
u.s

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,280
um and talk about how we got here so the

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,640
conversation today

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,599
is going to start around 1928 um

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,000
government

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
hacking clearly wasn't in the

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
conversation around 1928 but they were

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,519
talking about wiretapping

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,720
um and the conversation revolved around

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,640
um a um

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,480
a person named olmstead he was

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
he was a rum runner he he brought

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
alcohol in from canada into the united

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,440
states

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,360
um and was had been wiretapped

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
um and is a it was a very well known

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,360
case

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,519
and essentially the supreme court found

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
that the the fourth amendment did not

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,319
apply

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,319
in his case um uh it was a fairly

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,519
controversial

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,159
decision and the justices of the supreme

102
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,200
court

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
along with many many people after this

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,760
case was decided

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,959
i don't think it sat well

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
that this new wiretapping technology

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,200
wasn't going to be protected under the

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,319
fourth amendment

109
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,439
um as you'll see here i have a quote

110
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
as a means of espionage rights of

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,599
assistance and general warrants are but

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,360
puny instruments of tyranny

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,200
and oppression when compared with

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,560
wiretapping

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
there's a quote from justice brandeis um

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
general warrants are the reason the

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
fourth amendment was written

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
um into the constitution to begin with

119
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,320
so when you think

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,880
that calling a general warrant

121
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
insignificant when

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
compared to the dangers of wiretapping

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,919
that's a pretty grand statement

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,800
and as a result largely of this case we

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,639
get our very first wiretapping laws in

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,759
the u.s

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,639
in 1934 the predecessor to what is today

128
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,199
known

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,639
um as the wiretap act um although that

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,320
came later and it wasn't until 1967 that

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,880
we had

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,160
a case known as cats that really

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
overturned or maybe complimented

134
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,280
olmstead

135
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
weird legal questions that have come up

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
since

137
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
but we get the fact that the fourth

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
amendment attaches to people not places

139
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
and this reasonable expectation of

140
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
privacy test

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
but the wiretap act remains and this

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
idea that

143
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,360
new technologies require new enhanced

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
protections

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
still apply and the wiretap act actually

146
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
goes way beyond

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,639
the protections in the fourth amendment

148
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,919
and requires

149
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,600
more than the fourth amendment requires

150
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
so we're going to jump in time again

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,880
this time

152
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,639
up to 1999 where we have

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,360
what we know of as the first u.s

154
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
government hacking operation

155
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,039
um it was targeted at nicodemus scarfo

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,240
who was a mob boss out of philadelphia

157
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,400
um and the key it was a key logger

158
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,440
that was installed manually on his

159
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,080
computer in order to get a password

160
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,960
essentially he was using um end end

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,479
encrypted email

162
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,039
um pgp and they needed to get the

163
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,600
password in order to

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
be able to to know what um what he was

165
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,039
sending back and forth

166
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,520
really important theme coming from

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,120
government hacking operations

168
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,919
right out the door around transparency

169
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,840
even though

170
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
we were able to the public was able to

171
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,960
find out

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
that this was a hacking operation that a

173
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,720
key logger was involved

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,039
the fact that it was manually installed

175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,639
the details around that

176
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
were withheld for quite some time and a

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
lot of journalists

178
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
and public information open government

179
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,600
advocates had to do a lot of digging in

180
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,880
order to get the details

181
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,199
out around this case which is going to

182
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,160
become

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
a recurrent theme throughout government

184
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,039
hacking operations the government never

185
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,400
volunteers great great amounts of

186
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,199
information

187
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,680
about what they're doing in these cases

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
people really do a lot of digging

189
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
in order to find out what's going on um

190
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
so we'll call this generation one

191
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
which leads to of course generation two

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,840
the rise of the government hacking

193
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,919
machines we can we can say

194
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,400
we'll get tools like magic lantern and

195
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
cpav

196
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,639
um you know technology

197
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
um folks and lawyers both love acronyms

198
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,880
and so there's a

199
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
confluence here of just an abundance of

200
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
acronyms

201
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,080
computer and internet protocol address

202
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
verifier these are remotely

203
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,440
re installed tools um that also

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
communicate remotely

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,520
and are used to collect varying amounts

206
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,639
of information

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,680
depending on the operation at issue

208
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
once again we have a number of

209
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
journalists to thank for the information

210
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
that is publicly available

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
about these tools and about the

212
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,199
operations

213
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,680
in which they are used in particular a

214
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
bunch of journalists at wired magazine

215
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,960
and i want to offer my personal thanks

216
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,639
to the folks at wired

217
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,440
they've done some great reporting on u.s

218
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,039
government hacking operations and on

219
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,319
these tools and if you're really

220
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,560
interested about the history here

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,879
i suggest that you look up wired's

222
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,759
reporting

223
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,000
um because it's it's pretty stellar

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,960
one case in particular that i have found

225
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
really um

226
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,000
educational on this specific generation

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,039
of hacking operations is in rey

228
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,440
warrant to search a target computer um

229
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,958
case name really rolls off the tongue

230
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,279
right

231
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,200
you're really going to remember that i

232
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
know

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
essentially it was a case out of the

234
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,200
southern district of texas

235
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,720
in 2013 judge steven smith

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,399
there were a few holdings but two of

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,640
them really specifically stand out and

238
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,839
we're going to come back to these

239
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,440
holdings a few times

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
as i continue through the talk

241
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
the first one is that the warren

242
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
application

243
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,959
um in this case the government's um

244
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,760
request

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,000
to conduct the the search the hacking

246
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,880
operation

247
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080
did not satisfy the territorial limits

248
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
of the rule governing

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
um the authority of the magistrate's

250
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
issue that warren and

251
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
judge steven smith said i have limits

252
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
on my ability to issue a warrant in this

253
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,839
case

254
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,480
um under the rules of the federal rules

255
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
of criminal procedure

256
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,600
and this application does not satisfy

257
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,839
those limits keep that in mind

258
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,320
um spoilers you're going to be hearing

259
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,560
about this rule in great depth and just

260
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
a couple slides

261
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
he also said that the application did

262
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
not satisfy the fourth amendment's

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,040
particularity

264
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,320
requirement so if i go back just real

265
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,880
quick

266
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
um to the text of the fourth amendment

267
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,279
what you'll see is

268
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,279
right here at the end that it needs to

269
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,720
particularly

270
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
um describe the place to be searched and

271
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
the person or things to be seized those

272
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
are the last few words there in the text

273
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
of the fourth amendment

274
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
if you are not saying what computer

275
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
or who the person is that you're going

276
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
to conduct the operation against as many

277
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,880
of these hiking operations do not

278
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,680
um judge smith was essentially saying

279
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,800
you're not meeting

280
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,480
the standards that the fourth amendment

281
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
sets out

282
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
which brings us and as i said hold on to

283
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
those two holdings

284
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,240
don't let go we're coming back to them

285
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
it brings us to

286
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,079
kind of our third generation third type

287
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,320
of hacking cases as we move forward

288
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,079
into 2014 which is the playpen case

289
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,839
so in 2014 the fbi gets a tip

290
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,600
about playpen which is a tour hidden

291
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
service on which child

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,000
um exploitative material is being um

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,959
hosted shared distributed and they get a

294
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,440
search warrant to seize the website

295
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
but instead of taking the website down

296
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
as you would think they would do

297
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
they actually start to take over hosting

298
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
the website and in fact reports

299
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
say that um while the fbi was hosting

300
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,680
the website

301
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,120
that the quality of the website actually

302
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,760
went up

303
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
that they were hosting it better than

304
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
the people who were originally hosting

305
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,480
playpen were doing it they applied for a

306
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,600
second warrant

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,959
to send malware to visitors of the site

308
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,560
exploiting what we think is a

309
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
vulnerability in the firefox browser

310
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
code

311
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
and as estimates the best estimate i was

312
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
able to find

313
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,040
is that this led um to at least

314
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,120
137 separate cases

315
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,160
um so because of this operation

316
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,240
they went after 137 different

317
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
individuals

318
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,560
and in those cases all over the country

319
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,519
um potentially all over the world um

320
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,480
there were a lot of

321
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
different holdings that were coming down

322
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
and in fact professor orrin kerr

323
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
who spends a lot of time thinking about

324
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
these issues um has posited that

325
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,399
this is the first case that one single

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,000
warrant has led to

327
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,160
circuit splits where um entire circuits

328
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,360
have taken different holdings um

329
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,839
stemming from the same warrant

330
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
so as i said we're going to come back to

331
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
this rule that judge smith had pointed

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,480
to

333
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
the rule is rule 41 of the federal rules

334
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
of criminal procedure and it governs

335
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,240
when a magistrate judge

336
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,639
can issue a warrant and generally

337
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,959
speaking it says a lot of things about

338
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,760
when a warrant can be issued but as a

339
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,639
general rule

340
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,760
essentially a warrant should

341
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,839
authorize a search that occurs within

342
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,440
the jurisdiction

343
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
of the judge who is issuing the warrant

344
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
and there are exceptions so for example

345
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
if a judge issues a warrant to track a

346
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,600
car

347
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,079
and the car which is a mobile object

348
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
moves outside of that jurisdiction

349
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
a new warrant doesn't have to issue in

350
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,639
order to continue to track that car

351
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,920
um and that's baked into the rule itself

352
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,079
um but judge smith said i can't the

353
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,160
search doesn't occur

354
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
when you send out the malware it occurs

355
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,279
on the computer

356
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,079
itself and so unless you know the

357
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,480
location of the computer

358
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,480
i'm not able to issue this warrant

359
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,079
and courts in the playpen case

360
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,399
started thinking about this as well and

361
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,000
they started saying that

362
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,079
we also have to say that these this

363
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,480
warrant wasn't validly issued

364
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,560
um it didn't meet the requirements of

365
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,399
rule 41

366
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,120
because you didn't issue the warrant in

367
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
the location where these computers were

368
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,079
located

369
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,120
and therefore it doesn't meet this um

370
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,480
jurisdictional requirement that rule 41

371
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,399
has limiting where you can

372
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,720
where the judge could have issued this

373
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
warrant from

374
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
and this was triggering the exclusionary

375
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,839
rule which basically said that if a

376
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,360
warrant is invalid

377
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,519
the evidence from that warrant should be

378
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,720
excluded

379
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,639
as i said these cases were all over the

380
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,959
map um judges were

381
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,720
handing down all sorts of different

382
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,240
verdicts as

383
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
evidence and as these warrants were

384
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
getting this warrant singular

385
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,440
warrant was getting challenged um

386
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
and some of the cases were saying rule

387
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
41 made

388
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,120
this warrant invalid um and so cases

389
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
were starting to get thrown out

390
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,240
because of it and this

391
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,160
worried the fbi department of justice

392
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,440
um for clear reasons and decisions were

393
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,000
made

394
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
that they were going to start to pursue

395
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,519
amendments

396
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,360
to rule 41 to allow

397
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,399
this type of operation to happen

398
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,600
um in the future

399
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,800
so the amendment that they were pursuing

400
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,600
essentially

401
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,880
allowed for two different

402
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,440
new exceptions to that jurisdictional

403
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,480
requirement

404
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,959
the first was if the location of the

405
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,480
computer was being

406
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
that they were trying to search was

407
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,199
being concealed using technical means

408
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
and the effects um

409
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,720
from the computer were being felt in the

410
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,560
jurisdiction

411
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,639
then the judge could issue a warrant

412
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,880
from anywhere

413
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,560
um the second was if damaged computers

414
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,680
were located in five or more districts

415
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
then um a judge could issue a warrant

416
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
from anywhere

417
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,959
and this was a very contentious rule

418
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,759
change

419
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,680
um they also changed the notice

420
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,000
requirements for people impacted

421
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
and advocates experts

422
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
technical um technologists all came out

423
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
and said this is

424
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
a bad idea you shouldn't put this rule

425
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,920
change into effect they had a lot of

426
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,199
arguments

427
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,959
against it the least of which is

428
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,759
you are taking away a procedural

429
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,120
limitation

430
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,839
without considering whether or not we

431
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,160
need

432
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,160
substantive rules so whether or not

433
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
this type of operation should be

434
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
happening really is a question for

435
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,199
congress

436
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,720
but congress hasn't had a chance to

437
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,440
speak to that

438
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,639
but instead what you're doing is wiping

439
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,480
away this procedural

440
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,680
safeguard that is in place um

441
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,399
without going through congress who

442
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,000
typically would be needed

443
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,040
to authorize this type of activity

444
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,719
kind of seen as an end run

445
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,279
most of the debate most of the

446
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,680
discussion focused on this first prong

447
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,639
um location being concealed using

448
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,320
technical means affects being felt

449
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,160
within the jurisdiction

450
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,640
very little discussion actually focused

451
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,599
on

452
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
prong 2 which becomes really relevant we

453
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
start talking about the microsoft

454
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
exchange case which we're going to be

455
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,400
getting to

456
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,160
very shortly but i want to make sure you

457
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
had this background

458
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,839
on government operate hacking operations

459
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,760
more broadly and on rule 41 very

460
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,039
specifically

461
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,240
um and why

462
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
the exchange case um which will tell you

463
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,120
why the exchange case is so incredibly

464
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,480
important

465
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,400
um regardless of all of this opposition

466
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,000
the rule change ended up going into

467
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,919
effect um

468
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,480
largely without any changes whatsoever

469
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,960
even though a very narrow suggestion was

470
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,760
made

471
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
that um if location was being concealed

472
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,720
then maybe the operation should only try

473
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
to uncover the location

474
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,400
and not go any further to reveal any

475
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,919
other information about the computer

476
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,320
that change was also rejected

477
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,960
the change went into effect as it was

478
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,919
proposed in

479
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,960
late 2016 obliterated all these

480
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
procedural hurdles

481
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,679
that judge smith had spoken to

482
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
did leave in place the constitutional

483
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,039
hurdle and we'll

484
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,480
talk about that as we end up

485
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,160
as i wrap up the conversation

486
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,679
there was one last effort the smh

487
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,720
act very uh

488
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,679
purposefully titled the smh act it was

489
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,960
stop mass hacking

490
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,000
um but meant to allude to

491
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
shaking my head the popular internet

492
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,520
meme

493
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
um congress was not did not have to give

494
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
a blessing

495
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,480
to this procedural change but they did

496
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,720
have a role where they could

497
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
veto the rule change essentially and so

498
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,480
senator wyden

499
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
um with some partners in congress

500
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,280
introduced legislation to veto the rule

501
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
change unfortunately it didn't get

502
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
enough

503
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
um members of congress in its corner

504
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,600
to actually pass and so the rule change

505
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
still went into effect

506
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,559
regardless of this one last

507
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,320
effort to try to stop it from taking

508
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,639
place

509
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
so then where are we we were in a place

510
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,120
where

511
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,520
we had some procedural limitations on

512
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,039
hacking we had some constitutional

513
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,400
safeguards

514
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,360
all the procedural stuff we think got

515
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,440
wiped out

516
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,640
where does that leave us well let's stop

517
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,039
and talk about this microsoft case

518
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,559
um remember it opened i am a i'm a

519
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,799
lawyer i'm not a technologist so

520
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,320
i'm not going to go into great technical

521
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,480
detail about the exchange case

522
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,400
um i am happy to refer you to people who

523
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,679
can walk you through that

524
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,280
but i will give you an overview we're

525
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
going to call it the dummies guide to

526
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,559
the hafnam case

527
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,440
um and i encourage you to either reach

528
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
out to me and ask if you're looking for

529
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,240
more information

530
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,440
or i can send you some information to

531
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
um different materials online if you're

532
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,000
looking to just do research and

533
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,039
and read more about it so hapnium is

534
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,559
basically state-sponsored

535
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,360
actors traced back to china um they used

536
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
four zero-day vulnerabilities to

537
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,720
compromise

538
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,200
microsoft exchange servers um once

539
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,960
compromised they installed shells to

540
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,679
allow for

541
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,480
further exploitation both of the servers

542
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
and the downstream computers

543
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,960
um following several reports that

544
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
both the original hafnium actors as well

545
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
as other actors

546
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
were using the vulnerabilities to

547
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,440
compromise the servers

548
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
microsoft started to issue patches

549
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,360
um the fbi actually got involved sissa

550
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,280
this oh my goodness i'm so looped up in

551
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
the acronym of cisa i can't even tell

552
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,799
you immediately

553
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,559
the cyber security information sharing

554
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,520
agency and government issued an official

555
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,799
um briefing about this because it was

556
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
seen as being so critical

557
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,240
so all of these different government

558
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,080
agencies got involved microsoft saw it

559
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,840
as a critical

560
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,720
situation that required immediate action

561
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
they issued patches

562
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880
and sent out information to clean up the

563
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,679
shells

564
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,200
but estimates were saying that there

565
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
were still regardless of all of these

566
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
different actions that have been taken

567
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
a large number of shells that were

568
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
remaining

569
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,000
on different computers

570
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,360
and because of that the fbi decided that

571
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,679
they needed to step in and so they

572
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,360
sought and received a warrant

573
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,120
to search the servers copy

574
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,559
um and fourth amendment parlance sees

575
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,720
certain shells and then delete them

576
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,919
from the servers so they went further

577
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,840
than just to

578
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,720
copy them for evidentiary purposes they

579
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,480
deleted them fully off of these

580
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,120
computers

581
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,440
i want to identify a few things that

582
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,120
they did that went a little bit beyond

583
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
what they were required to do

584
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,120
by law in the warrant application

585
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,919
they identified exactly which servers

586
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,480
they were going to search

587
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,120
they looked up whois data they based the

588
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,080
application

589
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,840
um specifically on the difficulty of

590
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,679
removing the web shells they referenced

591
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,240
that they had

592
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,720
passwords for the execution of the

593
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
operation

594
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
they tested the code in advance

595
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,039
internally and with external experts

596
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,320
to limit the impact on other files

597
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,000
they requested delayed notice if you

598
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,760
remember back i said the rule 41

599
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,600
amendments changed how notice had to

600
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,400
happen

601
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,799
but they actually engaged in some early

602
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,679
notice

603
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,360
in addition to the request for them to

604
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,799
delay notice

605
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,840
so that they could try to

606
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,559
do extra outreach to folks who might be

607
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,400
impacted in advance even though they

608
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,320
didn't have to

609
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
that notice was eventually pursued

610
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,679
through both direct messages publication

611
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,039
and going through

612
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,240
internet service providers

613
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,360
and eventually they published and they

614
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,039
let the public know what they

615
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,679
had done and what was the public

616
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,480
response it was overwhelmingly

617
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,679
incredibly positive

618
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,120
um i published i put on this slide a few

619
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
of the

620
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,600
stories that were published the fbi

621
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,440
might have fixed your microsoft email

622
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,520
server said nbc

623
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
worked to remediate the compromises

624
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,360
continues

625
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
um you see

626
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
just security says were the government's

627
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,039
actions helpful based on the information

628
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,799
available now the answer is yes

629
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,200
just security is generally seen to be

630
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,159
pretty

631
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,679
left-leaning um here's a story that says

632
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,400
i believe this

633
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,720
involvement by the fbi is seen as

634
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,559
appreciated from the private sector when

635
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,000
it comes to protecting against

636
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,360
against nation state attacks it's a wise

637
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,080
move

638
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,440
this is very positive responses both

639
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
from

640
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
government and technical experts the

641
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,799
private sector

642
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,240
people in the media and these are just a

643
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,799
few of the examples

644
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,640
really if you and if you are on social

645
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,440
media during this time

646
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,360
overwhelmingly it was just a positive

647
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,799
response that we got

648
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,400
um everybody thought that what the fbi

649
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
had done in this case because of the

650
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,279
severity

651
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,279
of this case in particular and the

652
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
potential for

653
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,000
really negative impacts that this was

654
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,240
something that they should have done

655
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,279
and they did a good job doing it

656
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,559
um and

657
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,679
because this specific case

658
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,200
was receiving praise going backward

659
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
people started to say these rule 41

660
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,799
changes that everybody

661
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,720
like was really critical about those

662
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
were a really good idea we're really

663
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,919
glad that we did those

664
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,440
um and all of a sudden everything

665
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,360
that had happened leading up to this

666
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,799
although it seemed like a really great

667
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,720
idea and the fbi got a lot of pats on

668
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
the back

669
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,960
which is how we get to this talk and the

670
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
title of my talk about it being a

671
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,600
victory lap

672
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
and all of these good things that had

673
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,720
happened and

674
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,760
why i think we should take that victory

675
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
lap but also i think the victory lap is

676
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,200
probably ultimately

677
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,360
leading us to a pretty bad place

678
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,760
now i do want to note before the before

679
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,799
this case before the

680
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,559
microsoft exchange incident we really

681
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,799
don't have much indication

682
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,039
of the use of these new powers in rule

683
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,240
41.

684
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,799
now remember i said it is a theme in

685
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,279
microsoft hacking operations

686
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,360
that there's very little transparency

687
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,200
about what is happening and

688
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
it's up to journalists and open

689
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,279
government advocates

690
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,840
to track things down it's really hard to

691
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,120
figure out

692
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,039
what's going on and where it's going on

693
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,159
and so

694
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,400
while we have not much indication that

695
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,360
they have been used it doesn't

696
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,320
necessarily mean they haven't been used

697
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,120
but it doesn't mean they have is this

698
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
the first

699
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,559
maybe it will not be the last though

700
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,720
um these new authorities especially now

701
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,360
that um this positive reaction

702
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,919
has come because of this case um it's

703
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,200
going to be seen as a blessing for

704
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,799
future operations

705
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,120
not only in the us but countries around

706
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
the world are going to be

707
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
and have already been standing up and

708
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,799
taking notice

709
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,440
um we're not directly working with the

710
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,919
us and partner operations we know

711
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,559
the uk australia several countries often

712
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,039
often partner with the u.s

713
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,440
particularly on operations like

714
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,600
government hacking operations

715
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,080
they will presume that this is a green

716
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,720
light

717
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,360
to presume government hacking operations

718
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,880
and they're not going to look

719
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,440
to any safeguards that the u.s put into

720
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,799
place before they do so

721
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,840
they're not going to try to emulate um

722
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,360
what the us did in this instant instance

723
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,840
just that they did this hacking

724
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
stuff went into private servers did some

725
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
things and now it's okay for them to do

726
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
it as well

727
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,799
this is generally speaking what happens

728
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,039
when other countries look to the u.s as

729
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,840
an example unfortunately

730
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,799
in the meantime hacking operations are

731
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,000
full steam ahead

732
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,039
we still have no substantive law on

733
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,080
government hacking

734
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,279
in the u.s i talked about

735
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,399
and right at the beginning how we ended

736
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,360
up with

737
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,840
the wiretap act or the wiretap x

738
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,279
predecessor really

739
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,520
because wiretapping was seen as such a

740
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,960
significant deviation

741
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,080
so much more intrusive than previous

742
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,080
means of conducting service searches

743
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,960
do you really think that hacking is not

744
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,360
as

745
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,399
significantly different from what we

746
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,240
have done up until now in conducting

747
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,440
searches and wiretapping was

748
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,480
back in its time and

749
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
as you answer that i do want you all and

750
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
you're on a computer so i understand

751
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,919
that this is cheating a little bit

752
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,480
or some sort of device but to take a

753
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,240
look around you and figure out how many

754
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,200
devices

755
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
are around you right now that have some

756
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,039
sort of computer in them

757
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,600
and how many are going to be around you

758
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,159
in a year

759
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,200
or in five years as we start um seeing

760
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,520
the expansion of the internet of things

761
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,240
and what hacking is going to mean for

762
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,520
the government

763
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,440
as they can enter more in different

764
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,880
parts of your life and get different

765
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,399
types of information

766
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,880
through these operations that still are

767
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,720
not governed by their own

768
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,559
special and unique and necessary type

769
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,440
of safeguards

770
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,600
there's another quote from justice

771
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,039
brandes brandeis

772
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,480
in the same opinion looking through

773
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,440
to say you know someday there may be

774
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,399
developed

775
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,880
a way by which the government without

776
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
removing papers from secret drawers

777
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,440
can reproduce them in court and by which

778
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,360
it will be enabled to expose to a jury

779
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
the most intimate occurrences of the

780
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,480
home

781
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
he says advances in psychic and related

782
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,520
sciences

783
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,320
maybe not psychic but um may bring means

784
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,760
of exploring unexpressed beliefs

785
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,360
thoughts and emotions can it be that the

786
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,120
constitution of foreign protection

787
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,880
against such invasions of individual

788
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,960
security

789
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
just the idea that as technology

790
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,720
continues to evolve we have these

791
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,919
thoughts that

792
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,600
it's getting so far beyond even what

793
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,559
was thought of back in the days of

794
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,520
olmstead

795
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,679
and we're so far leagues ahead and we

796
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,200
need to be putting

797
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,080
new safeguards for what technology is

798
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,679
allowing the government to do today

799
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,200
one final reminder and then i'm going to

800
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,320
open up for um questions that this is

801
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,240
not happening in a vacuum this is in

802
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
fact a two-front were

803
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,520
um hacking provides incentives for the

804
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
government to undermine digital security

805
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,440
you don't necessarily want all of the

806
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,880
holes to be patched

807
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,960
if a whole is going to allow you to take

808
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,440
advantage

809
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,200
for an operation that you're going to be

810
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,440
pursuing in the next week or the next

811
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,399
month

812
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,559
at the same time the fbi doj and their

813
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,919
global partners

814
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,640
are working diligently or out in the

815
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,520
press

816
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,640
all the time trying to limit the

817
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,000
digital security that private sector

818
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,039
entities companies etc

819
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,799
can implement including what types of

820
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,559
encryption they can put into their

821
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,080
products

822
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,640
and significant amount of resources time

823
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,799
effort are being spent into countering

824
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,919
the narratives

825
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,399
that they are putting out which have

826
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,039
tried

827
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,799
which have significantly taken away from

828
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,080
the resources

829
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,200
that are necessary in order to engage

830
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
in these conversations around government

831
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,799
hacking unfortunately

832
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
and have meant that this conversation

833
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
has really suffered

834
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,000
from the lack of attention

835
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,440
and between the limits on encryption

836
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,880
and the spread of government hacking

837
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,399
operations i really don't know where

838
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,439
that's going to lead us

839
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,320
so it's going to end with a apocalyptic

840
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,919
scene of the future and i thought that

841
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,440
was really dark

842
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,279
and so i decided to end with this 1990s

843
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,320
high school middle school

844
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,279
picture backdrop and ask me ask if

845
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,799
anybody has any questions

846
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,840
um thanks a lot amy

847
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,159
um yeah so if if any of you have any

848
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,360
questions please

849
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,840
ask them in the general channel um while

850
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,880
we're waiting for

851
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,440
questions to come in i guess i'll last

852
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
one that's been on my mind

853
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,360
so um certainly there are many privacy

854
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,600
engineers and security engineers and

855
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,880
hackers who are taking all kinds of um

856
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,000
actions um some legal and some

857
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,399
less legal to limit the government's

858
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,440
ability

859
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,159
to um you know perform hacking

860
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,039
operations

861
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,960
and get insight into what people are

862
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,440
doing so um like a good recent case

863
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,519
um would be probably like signal and

864
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,919
like moxie

865
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,039
marlin spikes hack of the

866
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,200
celebrate device i'm sure like many

867
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
people in the audience have heard of

868
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,039
um signal of course has been under fire

869
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,760
from law enforcement for a long time

870
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,039
and moxie got a little bit of flack for

871
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,640
um you know potentially so so for

872
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,760
so so there was like one um interesting

873
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
blog post from rihanna

874
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
um peppercorn um i might be

875
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,519
mispronouncing her name but um

876
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,279
that that said something along the lines

877
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,880
of you know actions

878
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,600
like moxies which are you know hacking

879
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,000
devices used by the government rights

880
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,799
um you know provide like ammunition

881
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,480
essentially to lawmakers and law

882
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,760
enforcement to kind of increase their

883
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,360
capabilities

884
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,640
and um increase their leeway and so um

885
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,880
you know on the one hand we have um you

886
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,039
know people like people saying that

887
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,519
you know these these actions that you

888
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,799
know privacy engineers and security

889
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,399
engineers are taking it's kind of giving

890
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,799
lawmakers more ammunition to

891
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,200
um you know past legislation that we

892
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,320
don't really want them to

893
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,519
on the other hand it seems like

894
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,840
lawmakers have been very happy

895
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,679
to try and push the limits of what

896
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,240
they're able to to do to begin with

897
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,600
so um i guess i guess why i'm getting to

898
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,960
with this very long-winded questions

899
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,880
first of all

900
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,080
do you believe that like you know things

901
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,039
that

902
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,640
you know security engineers and privacy

903
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,080
engineers are doing

904
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
um to limits like government hacking

905
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,000
operations are

906
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,159
um and i guess this goes a little bit

907
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,320
into what your last besides thought was

908
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,640
right but um do you think they're like

909
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
um meaningfully

910
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,519
you know causing lawmakers to increase

911
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,719
the likelihood that they're going to

912
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,520
pass legislation that outright bans

913
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
intend encryption or you know make you

914
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,560
know increases the

915
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,320
legality of government hacking

916
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,839
operations and

917
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,879
um second thing is you know um

918
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,399
whether or not you believe that's like

919
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,639
gonna meaningfully move the needle

920
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,560
there um is that something that like

921
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,159
privacy and security engineers have to

922
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,199
be

923
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,960
i'm concerned about in your opinion like

924
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,719
do do they have to

925
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,760
cannot limit um you know the

926
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
the actions they're taking the

927
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,399
technologies they're developing so that

928
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:38,960
they're

929
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,719
like keeping the government sufficiently

930
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,320
happy um

931
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,960
you know with their capabilities without

932
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,599
you know

933
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,839
like kind of overstepping their

934
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,800
boundaries

935
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,960
so i think there are a few things there

936
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,440
there are technologists who i've

937
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,359
spoken to who very much

938
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,280
don't want to think that policy is a

939
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,200
thing and don't want to like engage in

940
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,680
the legal pieces of it

941
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,079
um and they'll

942
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,839
they've taken the position that they can

943
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,079
protect themselves

944
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,640
and that's good enough and i understand

945
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,280
that

946
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,640
like i know how to protect my

947
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,520
communications

948
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,839
i know how to you know secure my devices

949
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,000
and that's great

950
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,839
coming from a human rights background i

951
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,359
think there's an element

952
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,599
of working to secure

953
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,760
the broadest number of people that you

954
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,720
can

955
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,160
and how to make sure that

956
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,560
many people are able to

957
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,160
keep themselves free from

958
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,440
unwarranted government intrusion

959
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,480
um so there's

960
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,400
there's two the encryption conversation

961
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,839
the government hacking conversation are

962
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,160
two

963
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
very difficult to very different

964
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,760
conversations that are happening and

965
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
that's one of the reasons i want to like

966
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,480
it's a two-front

967
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,320
war because you can't really

968
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
engage on both sides at the same time

969
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,079
because for example encryption

970
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,920
we need almost a pro-encryption law

971
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,560
um because the fbi is going to continue

972
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,359
to try to

973
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,720
undermine it until we get something

974
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,160
good on the books and every time

975
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,119
we every time something happens in the

976
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:29,920
news

977
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,440
that's like for instance

978
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,640
celebrities like we can hack into apple

979
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
devices and then apple's like

980
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,400
we've stopped them from being able to do

981
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,079
that and celebrates we've gone around

982
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,839
like all of those back and forth that

983
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,320
you've seen over and over and over again

984
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,000
every time apple announces a new

985
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,520
way that they stop them from doing it

986
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,400
it gives the fbi more ammunition to go

987
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,160
into congress and say we need a way to

988
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,040
do this

989
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,680
um and until we get something positive

990
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,960
that's just the way it is

991
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,560
that doesn't mean apple should stop

992
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
doing what it's doing i would never ever

993
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,599
say that

994
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,599
but to phrase like you don't also go out

995
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,680
and frame it as like

996
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,920
we're here to like help criminals or

997
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
we're here to like

998
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,000
make it so that you can do bad things um

999
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,359
you have to like think about your

1000
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,720
framing

1001
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,880
and all of this on the government

1002
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,560
hacking side

1003
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
we need we absolutely need a lot like

1004
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,599
these operations are

1005
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,760
happening all the time um

1006
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,200
and there are people there are very

1007
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
hard-line people who are like

1008
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,880
no government hacking should happen at

1009
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
all and i don't think that's realistic

1010
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,400
if i'm going to be totally honest and i

1011
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,839
understand where those folks are coming

1012
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,119
from

1013
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,280
i think getting looking at the

1014
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,480
constitution

1015
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,680
and realizing like when that

1016
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,520
particularity piece comes in and knowing

1017
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,960
we have to abide by the limits of the

1018
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,079
constitution

1019
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,760
but then having the extra protections

1020
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,359
written into law is going to be really

1021
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,560
important um and

1022
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,359
there's a lot that can be done by

1023
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,440
non-government hackers to show what's

1024
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
possible

1025
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,079
um that is really great

1026
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,160
to have those offer that stuff out there

1027
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,760
within the confines of the law do not

1028
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,000
break the law this is not legal advice

1029
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,440
i'm not telling anybody to go out and

1030
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,359
break the law that's not a good thing

1031
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,320
but

1032
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,400
going out and doing things that show the

1033
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
potential of what the government can be

1034
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,920
doing and publishing and

1035
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,880
and talking about what's possible um can

1036
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,800
really start to

1037
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,680
pull the the curtain back on what the

1038
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
government could be doing for people who

1039
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,400
might not understand otherwise

1040
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,560
like congress yeah that makes sense

1041
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,960
all right we have had a few questions um

1042
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
let's see here i'm going to

1043
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,960
scroll through here um

1044
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
all right yowza asked the question that

1045
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,640
was um along the lines of

1046
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,040
how does it work with the location based

1047
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,200
things like gps on devices such as

1048
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,000
phones

1049
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,240
fitbits garmins and cars certainly

1050
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,320
people would enter more than five

1051
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,119
jurisdictions

1052
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,640
so the more than five jurisdictions

1053
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,320
element is specifically to get out

1054
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
things like the microsoft

1055
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,520
exchange where it's computers

1056
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,680
or what was brought up during the the

1057
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,880
debate around the rule was

1058
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,040
botnets where a botnet has

1059
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,160
bots in five or more jurisdictions and

1060
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,240
so so the fbi

1061
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,079
doesn't have to go to every single

1062
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,760
separate jurisdiction where a bot

1063
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,680
exists they can go to a single

1064
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,520
jurisdiction

1065
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,760
and get a warrant for the whole thing

1066
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,359
and it was really downplayed which is

1067
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,880
why why it wasn't part of the

1068
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,079
conversation it was like

1069
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,599
this is just a like a policy

1070
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,480
like we're just making it easier like so

1071
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,000
they don't have to go to all of these

1072
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,079
different places and they made it seem

1073
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,880
like a minimal change not like they were

1074
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,400
going to start going into computers and

1075
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,440
deleting

1076
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,160
programs off of computers this is like

1077
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,520
not something that was necessarily

1078
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,960
anticipated

1079
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,839
when the rule change was being discussed

1080
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,599
location

1081
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,680
was actually already anticipated by the

1082
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
rule i tried to mention this

1083
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,640
so if your car is being tracked like i

1084
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,440
said

1085
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,920
and you get a warrant in one's one

1086
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,520
jurisdiction

1087
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,040
and then in and the tracker is installed

1088
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
in that jurisdiction if anybody

1089
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
remembers the usb jones case

1090
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,119
the reason that warrant was invalid is

1091
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,119
because they installed the tracker

1092
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,680
outside of the jurisdiction where the

1093
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
warrant was issued and actually

1094
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,920
after the warrant was no longer valid um

1095
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,079
but if you install while the warrant is

1096
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,680
valid in the jurisdiction and then that

1097
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,000
car

1098
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,720
drives into as many different places as

1099
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,760
possible

1100
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,359
you don't have to go to all of those

1101
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,440
different places same with any location

1102
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,839
tracking

1103
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,400
people move all right we have um another

1104
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,880
question

1105
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,000
from scrim to win um considering that

1106
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,920
rule 41 defines location of the

1107
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,960
endpoints

1108
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
as the location where the crime is

1109
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,760
committed for jurisdiction purposes

1110
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,160
does that mean that in the example you

1111
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,200
gave if the tor

1112
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,240
exit node is in state a and the

1113
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,480
consumer's computer is in state b

1114
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,400
there's interstate trafficking of

1115
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,920
exploitative media um

1116
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,079
yes start start with that there's a

1117
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,200
little bit more to that question after

1118
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,960
that but

1119
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,800
so it's about the difference between the

1120
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,319
is it the difference between the tour

1121
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,040
exit node and the computer

1122
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,480
itself yeah it

1123
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,040
looks like the questions about um and

1124
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,520
and

1125
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,280
if you want to clarify our by the way in

1126
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,359
general feel feel free to do so

1127
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,400
um it's about um whether

1128
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,560
you know if four exit notes in one state

1129
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,920
and you know

1130
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,280
like my computer and in other states um

1131
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,359
whether that's um i guess

1132
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,720
that that constitutes interstate

1133
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,800
trafficking of deployative media and

1134
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
like whatever laws

1135
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,280
are um kind of there surrounding

1136
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,079
surrounding that

1137
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,079
i mean if you're using tor to be

1138
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,640
then you're engaging in obfuscating your

1139
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,040
location using technical

1140
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,200
my slides are still showing right yes

1141
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,439
yes

1142
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,040
you are concealing your location using

1143
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,480
technical means

1144
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,079
so it wouldn't matter necessarily where

1145
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,079
you were versus where the different

1146
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,520
where any of the tour nodes were

1147
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,280
including the exit node

1148
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,920
um at that point you are

1149
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,440
concealing your location because you are

1150
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,880
sending your traffic through the tor

1151
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,480
network um

1152
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,839
actually same with any vpn potentially

1153
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,280
um so that is

1154
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,000
what this is meant to do rule 41 doesn't

1155
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,400
go

1156
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,480
toward to the crime itself

1157
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,839
so child exploitation material

1158
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,599
is a absolute crime

1159
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,599
mentoring it doesn't like doesn't matter

1160
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,200
what your state of mind is

1161
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,480
if you have it it's a crime um federal

1162
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,680
state

1163
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,079
whatever it is like it what this just

1164
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,079
goes to

1165
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,240
whether or not they need where they can

1166
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,440
get a warrant

1167
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,599
to search your computer for not

1168
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,520
necessarily

1169
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,240
if it's a crime or not like i said this

1170
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,000
is a procedural limit

1171
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,240
not substantive it's not speaking to the

1172
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,440
substance of the crime this only goes to

1173
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,240
where they can go to get the warrant for

1174
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,079
it

1175
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,359
all right i think we have enough time

1176
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,040
for two more questions the first one

1177
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,440
from

1178
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,040
urban is um what current um work is

1179
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,720
going on in congress to

1180
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,000
like address the issues that you've

1181
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,480
discussed um

1182
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,280
in your presentation

1183
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,920
senator wyden has still been very active

1184
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,079
on these issues

1185
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,520
has been out in front discussing them he

1186
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,319
actually

1187
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,920
i don't know if anybody knows chris de

1188
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,560
goyan used to be the chief technologist

1189
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,319
at the american civil liberties union

1190
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,359
works with senator wyden's office

1191
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,280
incredibly smart actually testified

1192
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,640
against rule 41

1193
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,000
when he was at the aclu so he

1194
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,319
leads a lot of the work that senator

1195
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,960
wyden does

1196
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,480
definitely pay attention to that office

1197
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,560
in particular and then i know

1198
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,800
what else is happening up there right

1199
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
now with the transition in the new

1200
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,800
congress i don't know if there are

1201
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,960
actively pending bills that i'm aware of

1202
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,680
um but there are several different

1203
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,240
offices that get involved in this issue

1204
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,000
um on and off um and that is the

1205
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
widens is really the key office i think

1206
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,240
to key and on because normally he'll be

1207
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,079
if he isn't sponsoring the legislation

1208
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,839
he's promoting it

1209
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,560
all right all right um last question

1210
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,839
from brandon

1211
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,839
um going off the first question

1212
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,359
regarding government having and not

1213
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,800
disposing of vulnerability

1214
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,280
can you speak at all um to how eternal

1215
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,520
blue has been a prime example of this

1216
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,960
and how that um impacted things

1217
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,520
uh so there's a great the government

1218
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
has a process for this it's called the

1219
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,280
vulnerabilities equities process

1220
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,079
um it got re-god what is the term re

1221
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,960
invited reinvigorated under president

1222
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,599
obama

1223
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,599
um and then we didn't hear about it for

1224
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,880
a while and every now and then you'll

1225
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,319
hear again about the vulnerabilities

1226
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,560
equities process um

1227
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,240
it's supposed to take all of the

1228
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,000
different

1229
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,359
perspectives into a room and talk about

1230
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,960
when they tell you

1231
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,599
um when they release a vulnerability and

1232
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,520
when they don't

1233
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,400
but clearly with eternal blue we've seen

1234
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,599
that

1235
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,160
not only

1236
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,520
are there equities at stake about when

1237
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,520
they might want to use a vulnerability

1238
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,040
versus disclose it

1239
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,960
but if they can even guarantee that

1240
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,720
they're protecting

1241
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,359
what they're keeping one of the things

1242
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,160
that i worked very hard at for a while

1243
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,800
was this idea that the nsa the national

1244
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,920
security agency

1245
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,359
has two separate missions um that

1246
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,359
actually under admiral rogers when he

1247
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,280
was the head of the nsa

1248
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,119
stopped being two separate missions and

1249
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,640
he just like decided to make them a

1250
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,440
mission

1251
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,280
of signals intelligence and information

1252
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,040
assurance so they're both the

1253
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,119
code breakers and people who tried to

1254
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,720
make the code better

1255
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,280
and under their information assurance

1256
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,640
mission they're responsible for

1257
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,839
consulting with

1258
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,440
nist to the national institute for

1259
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,440
standards and technologies about

1260
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,000
encryption standards and it came out

1261
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,079
under snowden that they were

1262
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,880
basically like working to undermine

1263
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,640
encryption standards to preserve their

1264
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
own hacking capabilities

1265
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,839
um and nist came out with like we're not

1266
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,400
gonna let you do that anymore and

1267
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,960
standards around it i think we need more

1268
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,839
of those

1269
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,880
like flat out you can't do this these

1270
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,640
are the limits of what we're going to

1271
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,359
allow you

1272
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,240
to do and the name of preserving your

1273
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,319
ability to break into systems

1274
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,440
because we've seen the consequences and

1275
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,760
it's

1276
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,880
getting worse and worse and worse for

1277
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,839
people

1278
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,880
not any better and

1279
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,400
again with eternal blue and the fact

1280
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,000
that they're not protecting even their

1281
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,280
systems like nsa used to be

1282
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,520
untouchable nobody thought that anybody

1283
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,040
would ever be able to

1284
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,839
break into that big dark black building

1285
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,839
in maryland and

1286
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,440
again and again and again we've seen

1287
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,520
that that's not

1288
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,359
true anymore and we need to rethink i

1289
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,799
think a lot of things around that

1290
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,200
great well thanks a lot amy um and

1291
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,559
thanks everybody for your

1292
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,680
great questions um next up we have kurt

1293
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,000
von gardner talking about threat

1294
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,800
attribution

1295
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,839
