one of the feedback things that we got

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,280
um from last year

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
the ways to improve was to lengthen the

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,599
brakes in between last year we had

71
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,879
little five-minute breaks which in some

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,000
cases

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
bled over and didn't allow enough time

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,120
for

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
you know people to actually get up and

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,239
get

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
you know more coffee or or whatever so

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
this year we've linked in those

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,239
uh breaks to 10 minutes

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,200

135
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,080
channel uh so

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
i'm not saying you must be present to

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
win but in

138
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
most cases it is definitely helpful if

139
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,240
you are present to win

140
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
um um some some

141
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,160
of those giveaways we do have ideas on

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,520
how we're giving away

143
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
uh most of them but there may be one or

144
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
two words just like hmm

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,280
you know random roll of the die you get

146
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,759
the

147
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,880
giveaway so if you're um

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,199
in uh discord it very likely will not be

149
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
during lunch you know maybe at the end

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
of lunch you know time frame but

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
we do want to allow everybody time to

152
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,440
get outside and

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
step away from the screen enjoy a little

154

232
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
so i i want to point out something

233
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
you see i got oh look at that we have

234
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
a shirt we have shirts guys um we

235
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,360
weren't originally going to have shirts

236
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
but

237
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
you know i was uh sitting talking with

238
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,279
um with one of our sponsors rule 4

239
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,560
and they're like hey what are we doing

240
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,600
for shirts this year and i said well

241
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
i think we kind of made the decision

242
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
that we were not really going to do

243
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
shirts this year due to some of the

244
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,079
logistics

245
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,000
and rule 4 stepped up and said dude

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
