1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,359
hi

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,080
i'm jared brennan i'm an identity

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,200
strategy

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,200
and solutions advisor with sailpoint

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
and i've worked in a number of roles

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
throughout my career i've had enterprise

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,080
roles i've had consulting roles

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,680
now i'm on the vendor side and i put

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,680
together this talk

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,439
to tie a lot of that information

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,240
together to help organizations

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
understand how to harden their identity

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,840
infrastructure

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
by bringing the concept of threat

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,000
modeling to bear specifically on

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,680
identity a good starting point is to

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,840
just chew on this question for a sec

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,120
which parts of your business

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,600
rely on your identity infrastructure

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
if i'm talking pure place security i can

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,199
look at

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
some of the trends that we've seen

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,320
around data breach activity

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,000
over the years and i guarantee as you

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,879
dig deeper you'll find that

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
compromised identities are at the core

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,039
of

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,879
virtually every single breach that's

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,479
making the news

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,880
and then abuse of of the privilege

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,240
assigned to those identities and because

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,240
identity as a concept is so

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,399
pervasive throughout how our

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,960
organizations operate

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
there's tremendous value in figuring out

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,798
how to

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,479
harden that in a way that enables a

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
business to do what they do

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,520
without enabling attackers to get in

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,560
when uh

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,119
when they shouldn't um to just think

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,479
about this

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,960
at a high level uh provisioning

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,200
of new entitlements to an identity

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,880
um and let's let's take a new hire for

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560
example right if somebody gets hired at

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,199
your organization

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
they're going to get at a minimum a

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,479
domain account

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,600
and an email address now realistically

51
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,720
they're going to get a lot more than

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
that

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,840
but even if they're not on the domain

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,839
they're going to get creds into the hr

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,960
the payroll the benefit system

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
so that they can check their taxes right

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,039
they can

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,880
uh update their their benefits once a

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,239
year

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
everybody in your company has an

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
identity and and uh they're gonna have

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
access to something

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,760
now those domain accounts are gonna give

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,720
them access to a lot of things

65
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,840
um you know maybe their laptop internal

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,760
file shares like sharepoint

67
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,040
um eva or sharepoint right the wireless

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,959
network databases

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,239
on-prem apps there's a lot of stuff that

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,800
you're going to link back to

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
traditionally active directory and if

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
you're federating

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,920
then you may be giving them access to

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,879
some cloud apps as soon as they get

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,760
access

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,399
to that on-prem directory uh and even if

77
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
it's just like

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,599
sas apps or if it's infrastructure if

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
it's aws

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
if it's azure they're going to have a

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
login

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,440
and if that login isn't their domain

83
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
account it's going to be a native

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
account it might be

85
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
where the user use their email address

86
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
is the username

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,399
although the password is going to vary

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,440
from one platform to the next

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,959
and this is what we're talking about

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,400
when we talk about your identity

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,040
infrastructure at a very

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,879
high level and that's just flesh and

93
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,440
blood that's not even like

94
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,760
service accounts or rpa right robotic

95
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,200
process automation accounts

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,359
or customer accounts right i'm just

97
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,159
talking employees

98
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
so understanding kind of that flow is

99
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,200
step one

100
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,720
and if you ask yourself well you know do

101
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,359
we have any parts of our business that

102
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
don't

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,440
need identity that don't rely on the

104
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,440
identity infrastructure

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,120
you may have some components out that

106
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,760
there that are

107
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,599
maybe independent of this but i have a

108
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
hunch that's going to be a much smaller

109
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,399
subset than

110
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,239
uh than what identity touches and so

111
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,440
you've got some some choices to make

112
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,120
right you've got to

113
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
determine well where am i going to start

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
what path am i going to follow to to

115
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,879
clean all this up

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
um and i want to i want to give you some

117
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,159
of that here today

118
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,840
when i talk about identity i talk in

119
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,200
terms of identity governance and

120
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,760
administration

121
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,359
so this this is more than just iam right

122
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,399
your traditional identity and access

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
management

124
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,439
this is giving people access to the

125
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,159
things they need in order to do their

126
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,159
job

127
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,199
making sure that access is appropriate

128
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,519
at any given time and taking access away

129
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
when they don't need it that the concept

130
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
of governance really gets around

131
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,440
making sure that all the things that

132
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,440
you're doing are appropriate

133
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
and as you're applying threat modeling

134
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,919
to hardening your infrastructure you're

135
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,720
going to be making changes you're going

136
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,639
to be

137
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,080
reducing what people have access to

138
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
right the number of entitlements they

139
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
have

140
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,759
number of systems where they even have

141
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,840
accounts

142
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,199
governance comes into play there because

143
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
you want to make sure that you're not

144
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,479
doing something that's going to keep

145
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,239
somebody from doing their job

146
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,599
i'm a big fan of the identity defined

147
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
security alliance as a

148
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,199
a vendor agnostic resource for figuring

149
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,639
this

150
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
identity stuff out if you're not

151
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,400
familiar with the idsa

152
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,759
they're they're kind of like a wasp if

153
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,198
you're appsec right

154
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
the open web application security

155
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
project has been around for decades

156
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,400
uh the idsa has only been around for a

157
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,039
few years

158
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,239
and they're a blend of there are a lot

159
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,560
of vendor

160
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,479
organizations that have contributed

161
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,199
content based on what they're seeing in

162
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,320
the field

163
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,800
and what their technology does uh and by

164
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,639
a lot i mean over 20 different vendor

165
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,320
organizations have said

166
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,840
this is what identity looks like from

167
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,639
our side and there's also

168
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,039
a customer advisory board that includes

169
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,720
uh practitioners and consultants

170
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,800
to take all that information and say

171
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,000
okay now that we've got all this

172
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,639
this data what should people

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
be doing regardless of the technology

174
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,919
what

175
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,160
should people be doing if they're

176
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,120
they're covering all of their identity

177
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
things and what the idsa has done is

178
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,199
drafted

179
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,600
a an identity defined security framework

180
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
that includes just under 30 best

181
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
practices

182
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,960
that map to use cases and reference

183
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
architectures to to help answer that

184
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,318
question

185
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,440
it's freely available to download from

186
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:11,039
this website and they have a blog

187
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,039
that helps make the the connection

188
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,039
between what we see in practice and how

189
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,880
their framework applies

190
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,639
and i wanted to share some things there

191
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,680
before we get into the threat modeling

192
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,160
piece

193
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,199
so they've got three sections in that

194
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,600
blog

195
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,600
entry i just mentioned they talk about

196
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
challenges with identities challenges

197
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
with

198
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,440
access and privilege and then challenges

199
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
with third parties

200
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,600
because all of that is in scope for this

201
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,639
identity stuff

202
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,080
um when they look at their their

203
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
population and they tend to go out and

204
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,199
survey the market right larger companies

205
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
a thousand

206
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,600
users at a minimum usually uh

207
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,000
organizations with ten thousand or more

208
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,639
and they ask the the leaders the people

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,080
actually doing this stuff day to day

210
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
what's changed what does your

211
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,840
environment look like and

212
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
they look like at organizations over

213
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,520
half the organizations they

214
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,800
interviewed said that the number of

215
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,039
identities that

216
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,080
they're having to manage has increased

217
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,919
uh

218
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,520
more than five-fold over the past 10

219
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,840
years and

220
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,840
i know from my own enterprise days i had

221
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,638
to fight for every penny

222
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,440
of budget and every head count on my

223
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,639
team

224
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,400
over and over and over and as

225
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
more and more responsibility came our

226
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,000
way that didn't automatically mean we

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
got more budget or we got more people

228
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,840
it just meant we had to get more

229
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,360
creative about how we managed that

230
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,719
environment and in the identity space i

231
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,240
have a hunch whether it's through

232
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,440
organic growth whether it's merger

233
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
acquisition

234
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,039
uh you're seeing some of the same that

235
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,239
you're managing more identities but at

236
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,919
the same time

237
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,080
all these additional identities result

238
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,400
in stale accounts that

239
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,400
nobody's using anymore but nobody knows

240
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,440
to turn them off

241
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,120
complexity is the enemy of security and

242
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,680
as you're taking on more and more you're

243
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,840
adding complexity to your environment

244
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,039
that complexity if you look at the

245
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,198
number of

246
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,960
passwords we're asking users to remember

247
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,080
some of these organizations

248
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,840
had nearly 200 separate accounts that

249
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,800
people were using to log in and do their

250
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,239
jobs

251
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,240
and when i look at password security and

252
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,919
we we say why are people using stupid

253
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,599
easier to remember passwords

254
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,359
it's because we're making it too complex

255
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
for them to do their jobs

256
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,479
it's because we're creating all these

257
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,000
disconnected systems

258
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,359
and they've got to have a way to get in

259
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,639
the system and prove that they are who

260
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,639
they say they are

261
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,720
and the numbers are real i mean this

262
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,360
isn't hyperbole this isn't made up this

263
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,800
is

264
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,479
what they're finding when they go out

265
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,279
and talk to people and say hey what's it

266
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,039
look like in your environment

267
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,279
and when we look at it from a threat

268
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
perspective they're finding that almost

269
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,399
every single

270
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,600
attack against these organizations every

271
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,519
single threat

272
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
requires some sort of human interaction

273
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,720
which is why

274
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,160
identities and the accounts associated

275
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
with those identities are such high

276
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,680
value targets

277
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,959
i've done a lot of pen testing over the

278
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,479
years and

279
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,479
privilege escalation and lateral

280
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
movement are just beat into me that

281
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,440
that's

282
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,680
that's what you do when you you pop a

283
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
box right you establish persistence

284
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,719
give yourself the highest level

285
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
privilege you can on that box and then

286
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,680
try to grab another one so that even if

287
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,920
they find you on the one

288
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,959
you're still in you can still do what

289
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
you're doing

290
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,479
marriott unfortunately with their

291
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
publicly disclosed data breach

292
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,560
had an attacker on their network for

293
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,040
four years before they caught them

294
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,719
four years and i look at that and say

295
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,519
god that's ridiculous how does that

296
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,440
happen

297
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,200
because the attacker knew how to get in

298
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,440
establish that persistence

299
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,959
and then act like they belonged there

300
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
that their account looked

301
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,160
like it was doing what it should be

302
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,320
doing um

303
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,319
and we're seeing that you know the vast

304
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,959
majority of these breaches and just

305
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,600
attacks in general successful or not

306
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,599
are going after privileged accounts and

307
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,279
abuse of those privileged accounts

308
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,920
whether it's by an attacker by an

309
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,760
insider is one of the top three patterns

310
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,360
that shows up in the the dbir from

311
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,880
verizon

312
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
and then of course like i said with

313
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,800
lateral movement um once somebody's in

314
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,959
they're gonna try to get around

315
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,560
and that's just the the corporate

316
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,800
accounts right now that we're extending

317
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,560
our trust to these third parties

318
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
we're crossing our fingers and hoping

319
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,599
they're doing the same

320
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
and those third parties you can have

321
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,240
nearly 200

322
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,519
uh third parties that you're sharing uh

323
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,640
you're letting log into your

324
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,800
your stuff every week with nearly three

325
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,880
times that the number of third parties

326
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,319
who somebody your organization is

327
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,240
sharing data with

328
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,839
is giving sensitive data to all of this

329
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,920
comes back to your identity

330
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,519
infrastructure if you don't have

331
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,439
preventative controls in place and if

332
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,600
you're not monitoring for

333
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
uh aberrant behavior right potential

334
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,880
misuse

335
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,240
then you quickly become one of these

336
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,720
statistics

337
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,200
um the idsa in their most recent paper

338
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,000
identity security work in progress

339
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,760
hired a research firm to go out and talk

340
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,519
to over 500

341
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,360
they're called qualified professionals

342
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,640
so this is executives

343
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,959
uh individual contributors and managers

344
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,560
who are actually doing identity on a

345
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,040
day-to-day basis

346
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,800
and again that that broad spectrum like

347
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,040
a dozen different industries and and

348
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,199
then some

349
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,480
accounts ranging anywhere from 1 000

350
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,320
employees to

351
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
uh they've got a whole category of 10

352
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,519
000 and up

353
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
and these are the patterns that these

354
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,440
people shared

355
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,800
anonymously with the research firm to

356
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,399
say yeah this is what we're seeing

357
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,399
94 virtually every single one of them

358
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,399
who they talk to said yeah we had a

359
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,279
breach and identity was part of the

360
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
problem

361
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,200
and of that 94 right well of the the

362
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,680
entire population

363
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,079
uh 79 percent and it happened said it

364
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,959
happened within the last two years

365
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,638
um so this isn't some trend that uh that

366
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,599
we're moving away from it's still very

367
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,880
much

368
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,360
a a an active real thing

369
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,480
and the overwhelming majority 99 of

370
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,240
these people

371
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
said that we could have prevented it had

372
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,800
we done something different on the front

373
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,079
end

374
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
this could have been stopped and i i

375
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,920
don't know who that one percent is

376
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,920
right i i got to think that you know in

377
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,599
my experience everything's preventable

378
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,120
from a security perspective

379
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
except for that you know black swan

380
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,519
scenario but

381
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,120
uh i i'm not here to judge right i'll

382
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,200
just leave that as is

383
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,560
the the last stat i wanted to share from

384
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,279
from that report um

385
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,279
is that they they took a look at these

386
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,639
organizations and asked them to

387
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,600
categorize themselves as either

388
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,120
proactive forward-thinking or reactive

389
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,399
and the proactive organizations

390
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,000
saw an impact or even a

391
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,120
breach to the tune of 25

392
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,160
less than the number of organizations

393
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,360
uh who classified themselves as reactive

394
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,360
and i mean that that concept comes at no

395
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,320
surprise if you do security well on the

396
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
front end

397
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,519
the likelihood of bad things happening

398
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,000
goes way down

399
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,160
but to me the number of organizations

400
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
right the disparity between

401
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,240
we decided to do something on the front

402
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,160
end versus yeah we just wait

403
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,440
until we see something publicly

404
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,279
disclosed and then

405
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,480
go into scramble mode it was a pretty

406
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,920
big gap

407
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,240
highly recommend you check out this

408
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,800
report and that you use it internally

409
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,680
as you're sharing this information

410
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,760
because it can be

411
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,279
overwhelming and i know it can be doom

412
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,959
and gloom and oh those numbers are

413
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,720
terrible how will we ever

414
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,279
uh ever get ahead of it that's not the

415
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
case no when you apply this concept of

416
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,279
threat modeling

417
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,599
to with a specific focus to your

418
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,160
identity infrastructure

419
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,279
you can have a measurable positive

420
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,279
impact

421
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,639
on whether or not you become one of

422
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,240
those statistics

423
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,360
and when i say this concept of threat

424
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
modeling

425
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,079
it's about applying a very deliberate

426
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,959
systematic approach a repeatable

427
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,760
process toward identifying threats and

428
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,160
attackers

429
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,319
and putting safeguards in place that you

430
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,719
can come back to again and again

431
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,760
and track improvement and show people

432
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,680
that yeah we're

433
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,720
we're making changes for the better and

434
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,000
this isn't compliance right because

435
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
if you go out and look at publicly

436
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,519
disclosed data breaches the number of

437
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,800
compliant organizations that

438
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,279
have ended up on these lists is way too

439
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,439
high

440
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,199
and the number of compliant

441
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,199
organizations that don't even realize

442
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,319
they've been compromised yet

443
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,079
is the bigger concern compliance is

444
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
binary right we're either doing it or

445
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,079
we're not doing it but when you you

446
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,479
bring

447
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,680
threat modeling into play you're adding

448
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,399
a lot of level of

449
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,359
quality uh to your process right now

450
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,399
it's not one

451
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,639
one or zero right it's all or nothing no

452
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
it's this is how deep we're going and

453
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,279
how well we're doing

454
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
at tracking all of this um carnegie

455
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,639
mellon's

456
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
software engineering institute has a uh

457
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,959
a write-up

458
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,600
on a dozen different threat modeling

459
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
methodologies that you can use i've got

460
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
a link to it here at the end of the

461
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,040
presentation

462
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,480
i'm not covering all of these today but

463
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,880
i do want to cover

464
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,240
two of them to help you get started

465
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,240
although you may want to check out that

466
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,120
that article after you

467
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,920
you get your feet under you the two most

468
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,519
common

469
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,800
threat modeling methodologies you're

470
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,160
going to hear about in the space are

471
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,680
stride and dread

472
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
they both came out of the microsoft

473
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,638
space they're both

474
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,800
uh not being maintained

475
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,839
as kind of an active discipline or

476
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,160
practice but they're

477
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,120
they're still both pretty relevant

478
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,880
they're they're pretty

479
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,720
uh active in the the industry a lot of

480
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,040
folks are using

481
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,320
them today and they take slightly

482
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,639
different approaches

483
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
to threat modeling both of them use

484
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,240
mnemonics

485
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,199
so stride stands for spoofing tampering

486
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,040
repudiation

487
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,880
information disclosure denial service

488
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
and elevation of privilege

489
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,920
and when you're identifying a threat and

490
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,839
running it through this process

491
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,519
stride is saying i want you to answer

492
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,639
these six questions

493
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,519
about the threat where does it fall and

494
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,720
um dread takes more of an impact-based

495
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,199
approach to say

496
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,759
you know with with these threats how bad

497
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,560
are they

498
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,040
damage reproducibility exploitability

499
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,160
affected users discoverability

500
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,480
um and so either methodologies

501
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,439
is taking this idea of hey there's a bad

502
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,560
thing that we have to

503
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,079
to do something about and putting some

504
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,199
values to it putting some criteria

505
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,079
that you can measure to say because this

506
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,639
one

507
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,000
is more significant than that one we're

508
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,720
going to take action on this one

509
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,160
first and so the the point of of the two

510
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,920
methodologies

511
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,680
is to help you do just that is is to

512
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,439
help you put

513
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,880
some prioritization around what you do

514
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,079
so that you're not spinning your wheels

515
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,360
and most importantly so you're not

516
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,399
spending time

517
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,839
on the minutia and spending time on

518
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,360
things that can have the the most

519
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,199
significant impact your organization

520
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,720
when you apply the threat modeling

521
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,119
process there's a

522
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
simple four-step process that you'll go

523
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,799
through

524
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,919
regardless of which methodology you use

525
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,000
model the system

526
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
find the threats address the threats and

527
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
validate and this is what i want to go

528
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,640
into

529
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,000
at this point i want to talk about tools

530
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,640
and techniques

531
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
that you can use at each of these phases

532
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,880
at each step

533
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,480
along the way to help you build out that

534
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,799
repeatable process

535
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,160
so let's start with step one modeling

536
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
your system

537
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,679
here the system is your identity

538
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,440
infrastructure so

539
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,360
how do you do that how do you model your

540
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,360
identity infrastructure

541
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,719
well it it helps if you know

542
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,399
where your identities can do things

543
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,320
right we talked about identities have

544
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,039
access to resources

545
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,399
well the access is usually granted

546
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,280
through an account

547
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,559
and the level of access the specifics of

548
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,039
what they can do

549
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,559
are all the entitlements associated with

550
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,960
those accounts

551
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,559
but from an identity governance

552
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,520
perspective you got to step back and

553
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,360
take a one

554
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,679
one layer higher i'm not just looking at

555
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,879
accounts i'm looking at flesh and blood

556
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,360
people

557
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
me jared right i at the company i work

558
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,840
for

559
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
have multiple accounts and i have

560
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,439
different entitlements in all these

561
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,159
systems where these accounts have access

562
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,880
but i'm one person and all of those

563
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,720
accounts

564
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,080
have this there's a one-to-many

565
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,400
relationship

566
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,559
between jared the identity and the

567
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,520
accounts that jared has

568
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,000
so in order to kind of reverse engineer

569
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,400
that

570
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,919
mapping of identity to accounts you've

571
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,840
got to figure out where all of your

572
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,480
authentication stores are

573
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,760
and start creating this like an identity

574
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,120
warehouse right you need some

575
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,160
mapping to say this person has access to

576
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
all these things

577
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,679
and i say that that's at a corporate

578
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,360
level right that might be an employee

579
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,679
that might be a contractor

580
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,918
but now with the rise of especially

581
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,679
robotic process automation becoming so

582
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,520
ridiculously popular

583
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,160
um there are all these non-human

584
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,120
accounts that don't map back to a flesh

585
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
and blood person

586
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,559
although you might say that jared is the

587
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,480
one responsible for an rpa account so

588
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,080
there may be an association

589
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,960
between a human and a non-human account

590
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,720
that's a good first step is identifying

591
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,120
all those directories

592
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
also looking at your third parties your

593
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,039
customers right

594
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,320
don't exclude those apps or systems

595
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,720
because they're not employees

596
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,200
again if it's an identity if it's a

597
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,679
person needing access to a thing

598
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
you you want to capture that information

599
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,240
somewhere so there's

600
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,840
a little bit of legwork a little bit of

601
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,280
investigation here

602
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,159
when you're looking for authentication

603
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,600
stores um you might look at

604
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,320
larger systems or platforms anything as

605
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,360
a service

606
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,080
would be your your cloud authentication

607
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
stores

608
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,559
you're going to have authentication

609
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,719
stores on-prem that more often than not

610
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,160
are going to be an ldap directory or a

611
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,480
database

612
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,440
ideally you're going to be moving a lot

613
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:10,080
of things toward a single ldap store

614
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,559
again complexity versus simplicity here

615
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,240
but start by trying to just put that

616
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,120
list together

617
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,120
and in order to to help you put that

618
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,959
list together

619
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,320
go into the process with the concept of

620
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,880
the joyner mover lever

621
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,158
life cycle in the identity space this is

622
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,200
a pretty common

623
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,880
uh model you'll come across it at some

624
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,120
point if you haven't already

625
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
uh and these are the events that result

626
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,879
in state changes

627
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,640
with your identity right if i don't have

628
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,679
a relationship with an organization

629
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,360
today

630
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,000
and then i sign up somewhere and they

631
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,600
say okay jared you as a person have this

632
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
relationship now we need to start giving

633
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,678
you

634
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
accounts and giving those accounts

635
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,280
entitlements that initial

636
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,879
sign up is a joiner event and it's

637
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,960
from a business process standpoint it's

638
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,240
going to trigger all the technical

639
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,520
changes that happen to

640
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,840
enable me to have access to things

641
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
now over time those relationships

642
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,840
inevitably change

643
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,360
in the employee space this is you know

644
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,879
commonplace people get

645
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,959
promoted people move to a different

646
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,000
department people go on long-term

647
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,080
maternity paternity disability leave

648
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,240
people retire but still need access to

649
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,559
certain things in order to do their jobs

650
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,320
those mover events still need to be

651
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,918
identified and tracked but they're

652
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,240
they're much more complex to automate

653
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,000
you can automate a joiner event to some

654
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,919
extent but the mover events

655
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,360
require a little more delicacy a little

656
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,799
more intricacy

657
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,559
and then at some point there's a lever

658
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,559
event when someone

659
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,600
is no longer engaged with the

660
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,639
organization

661
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,719
if i'm not there anymore and you need to

662
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,760
take my access away well you need to

663
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
know

664
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,280
where i have access you need to have

665
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,120
that one-to-many mapping

666
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
defined because when that lever event

667
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
happens if i'm leaving on unfriendly

668
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,678
terms

669
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,760
the reality of human nature is sometimes

670
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,520
people are hot-headed sometimes people

671
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,600
make decisions that they'll regret later

672
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,000
on but those decisions can have

673
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,360
damage decisions like deleting an entire

674
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,960
organization's

675
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,280
cloud storage account look that story up

676
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,559
that's a fairly recent story that is

677
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,240
very concerning so look at your

678
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,760
authentication stores within that

679
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,080
identity governance life cycle because

680
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,799
you want an idea of when things change

681
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,960
and how do you collect this information

682
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,960
if your organization has a cmdb

683
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
start there it's going to have most of

684
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,880
what you need if you've got

685
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,039
a team doing more like service

686
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,799
management and asset management now

687
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,280
they may have collected the vast

688
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,039
majority of this information already

689
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,039
you'll want to spend some time looking

690
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:49,520
at excuse me third-party relationships

691
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,360
which include not just vendors you're

692
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,520
working with but even like software as a

693
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,080
service app so people are using

694
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,200
you can find a lot of this with your

695
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,879
procurement

696
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,240
your accounts payable teams if you sit

697
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,799
down with them

698
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,679
and say who are we paying monthly bills

699
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,320
to right

700
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,280
who are we paying bills and how do i

701
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,399
know whether or not

702
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,280
that relationship comes with access

703
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,720
with login to a website somewhere or if

704
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,918
we're granting those people

705
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,480
the ability to log into our stuff

706
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,000
they'll know so build that relationship

707
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,559
with your procurement team your ap

708
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,280
team uh you can also use technology like

709
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,000
a cast be a cloud access security broker

710
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,520
um you can look at heck even if you've

711
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,520
got a layer 7 firewall

712
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,879
and you're looking at application

713
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,120
traffic for login

714
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,480
activity right you've got technology

715
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,239
deployed today

716
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,080
that will help you round out the data

717
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,360
you get from your ap and procurement

718
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,918
team that will

719
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,000
help you uh identify that shadow i.t

720
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,240
especially if you're not paying for it

721
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,760
it's one thing to go say who are we

722
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,400
paying each month

723
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,200
but it's another thing to say uh where

724
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,760
are people

725
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,360
uploading data uh but we don't have a

726
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,960
business relationship we don't have a

727
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,000
contract they're just

728
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,480
doing it um and what i found and

729
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and this is crazy simple but it works

730
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,200
uh reach out to people non-technical end

731
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,760
users

732
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,799
and ask them a very specific question

733
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,520
here

734
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,120
what websites do you log into in order

735
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,440
to do your job

736
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,918
i guarantee every single person at your

737
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,640
organization can answer that question

738
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,320
because it's not technical it's not

739
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,400
overly complex

740
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,000
and they all know what their job is

741
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,279
right you don't that's not your job your

742
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,360
job is to help them

743
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,600
secure it but if you reach out to these

744
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,760
line of business end users

745
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
that will help fill the gaps in where

746
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,799
these other two tools

747
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,360
may be lacking and especially now that

748
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,879
we've had such a monumental shift

749
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,158
to remote work you may find that

750
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,919
some of that collaboration is happening

751
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,279
more quickly as people are just signing

752
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,480
up and using things without going

753
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,080
through ap

754
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,520
without going through procurement uh

755
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,720
with um

756
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,400
stuff that they're all connecting to

757
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,600
over the internet that doesn't

758
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,240
necessarily have

759
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,678
uh uh you don't have visibility into the

760
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,039
network traffic

761
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,919
so uh use that uh non-technical approach

762
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,960
and on your network right do an nmap

763
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,840
scan look for

764
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,200
your directories ldap listens on 389 and

765
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,480
636

766
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,760
uh if it's ldap s right secure

767
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,200
and then http and https your

768
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,240
web apps you know are going to have a

769
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
login page

770
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,960
so traditionally you're going to find

771
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,439
them at 80 and 443 but all the admin

772
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,080
consoles all the non-standard ports that

773
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,600
the

774
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,120
development teams and the the

775
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,760
infrastructure teams

776
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,039
have enabled uh for administration or

777
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,158
for testing

778
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:55,520
uh 8080 8443 are

779
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,159
common but they're not exclusive

780
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,200
um so and and this is above and beyond

781
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,120
like your

782
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
uh if you've got bnc if you've got

783
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,959
secure shell right what all the other

784
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,919
protocols but you're looking for

785
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,039
where can people log in and you can get

786
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,120
that within map

787
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,919
and nmap remains one of the most uh

788
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,840
useful free tools in the infospec

789
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,919
infosec space today

790
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,439
um so once you you do that step one

791
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,200
right you're modeling your identity

792
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,720
infrastructure you're looking at

793
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
your your joint or move reliever

794
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,840
workflows you're looking at all the

795
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,039
places that people have accounts and

796
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,520
entitlements

797
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,200
mapping that back to identities then

798
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,559
you're ready to shift your attention to

799
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,320
the threats

800
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,080
and when it comes to identifying threats

801
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,000
that you should consider right threats

802
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,158
that you should

803
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,279
evaluate as part of your process

804
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,039
privacyrights.org has maintained a

805
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,640
chronology of publicly disclosed data

806
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,080
breaches for years

807
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,360
they have breaches dating from 2005.

808
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,918
to 2019 who was compromised what do we

809
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,360
know about

810
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,200
how many records um and they stopped

811
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,639
maintaining the database in october of

812
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,320
2019

813
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,120
with a promise that they'll get back to

814
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,520
it but you can take

815
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,879
all of that years and years of data that

816
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,039
they've collected

817
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,720
and look at the aggregate that comes out

818
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,400
each year from the verizon data breach

819
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,399
investigations report

820
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,480
where they identify trends and patterns

821
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,799
based on data breaches

822
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,000
some of which may not have been publicly

823
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,158
disclosed

824
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,840
also take a look at how i've been pwned

825
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,360
from troy hunt

826
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,879
to to date have i been pwned

827
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,840
has nearly 10 billion accounts

828
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,399
in their database so going out there and

829
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,959
looking at what resources has troy

830
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,080
incorporated into that tool is going to

831
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,840
give you an idea

832
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,000
to kind of follow the the trail follow

833
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,439
the breadcrumbs back to that data breach

834
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,080
and if it ended up and haven't been

835
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,480
blown can we get back to root cause

836
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,000
what's been publicly disclosed about it

837
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,399
and then i'd also look at google news

838
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,480
i've got some alerts set up they're just

839
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,479
daily emails of keywords

840
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,600
a quick search on the keyword data

841
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,440
breach

842
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,918
or even just go at their point in time

843
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
and look you've got a lot of information

844
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,120
you can tap

845
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,240
into about publicly disclosed data

846
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,559
breaches

847
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,320
go back and look at what were the root

848
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,240
causes of these breaches what do we know

849
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,000
about how the attackers got in

850
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
and build that into your throat modeling

851
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,520
exercises

852
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,639
you should also download nist special

853
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,480
publication 830 rev one

854
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,159
their guide for conducting risk

855
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,760
assessments even if it's

856
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,880
only for appendices d and e

857
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,840
um appendix d uh outlines the number of

858
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,399
threat sources

859
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,000
and appendix e outlines a number of

860
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,399
threat events it's i mean it's almost

861
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,679
like a checklist right copy paste

862
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,719
over into your um your your threat

863
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,000
modeling

864
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,960
documents right and uh you've got a huge

865
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,399
head start you're not having to sit in a

866
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,480
room and just

867
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,080
come up with stuff out of thin air no

868
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,600
these people have done

869
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,399
a lot of research over the years and

870
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,760
they're giving you a lot of information

871
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,600
to help you get started and what i

872
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,960
really like about the nisstock

873
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,199
is from a technical standpoint

874
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,399
uh a technologist tends to go right down

875
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,919
into the weeds

876
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,600
right i want to look at the the

877
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,159
vulnerabilities on the system give me

878
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,158
the

879
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,520
the bone scan reports let me look at the

880
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,559
the criticals that

881
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,840
have publicly disclosed uh exploit code

882
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,158
right um but nist breaks down this

883
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,678
uh these threats into three different

884
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,120
categories right there there's the

885
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,159
information system level but then

886
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,959
there's also

887
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,399
like the business process level right

888
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
are your users doing

889
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,279
anything in their day-to-day job that if

890
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,679
that process is disrupted or

891
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,559
just by the nature of that process or is

892
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,360
there

893
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,000
a body or population of threats that are

894
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,000
relevant

895
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,840
to what they're doing and how they're

896
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,880
doing it and then at the organization

897
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,080
level

898
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
there are another family of threats like

899
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,720
take

900
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,000
mergers and acquisitions if you've ever

901
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,880
been involved in m

902
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
a whether you've been in a company

903
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,480
that's been acquired you've been the

904
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,600
company doing the acquisition

905
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,960
you've done consulting around that

906
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,600
if you have two companies that have

907
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,159
grown up independently of one another

908
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,240
and suddenly all of their identities

909
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,919
need to be able to work together

910
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,679
that all these systems and apps need to

911
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,080
talk to each other

912
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,480
you might find it becomes least common

913
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,879
denominator until we can figure it out

914
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,000
i did consulting once for a company that

915
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,039
had their stuff together

916
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,720
right their active directory uh security

917
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,360
posture was actually pretty

918
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,520
tight um and they were bringing in a

919
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,559
very immature company from a technology

920
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,240
standpoint

921
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,399
and in order for this company to

922
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,880
continue operating

923
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,520
the team that was doing it well had to

924
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,840
loosen

925
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,918
and lighten their controls right they

926
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,760
had to let up on what they were doing

927
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,519
otherwise the company could make money

928
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,200
and that money pays for the tools it

929
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,919
pays for the budget it pays

930
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,440
salaries so um that's there's a

931
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,519
different kind of threat

932
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,200
than a very specific like a single

933
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,840
injection attack right

934
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,760
it's it's very different but um that's

935
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,360
the value that when you look at the nist

936
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,200
stock that the value of looking at

937
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,678
holistically at this stock can give you

938
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,000
it also points out a distinction between

939
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,360
adversarial threats and non-adversarial

940
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,399
threats because

941
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,918
sometimes uh stuff is just accidental

942
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,600
right if somebody's using an account

943
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,360
that's over entitled they're a

944
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,480
privileged account that has way too many

945
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,399
privileges

946
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,080
that's not necessarily intentional but

947
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,879
the damage is still going to be just as

948
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,480
bad

949
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,799
if an attacker gets our hands on that

950
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,640
account so look at this this document

951
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,799
and i've got a presentation i've done a

952
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,880
number of times called hacking identity

953
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,158
where i go into a lot more detail about

954
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,919
pen testing and

955
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,840
tools and techniques that i would use as

956
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,120
an attacker and people a lot smarter

957
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,720
than me would use

958
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,600
to get in uh within 15 minutes on day

959
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,679
one

960
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,600
and it's always always going after

961
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,880
credits i mean it's not overly

962
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,120
complicated exploits

963
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,720
it's a lot of it's password spraying i

964
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,639
do a lot of ocean gathering

965
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,640
and try to gather information that might

966
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,399
help me later on

967
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,559
but i've got a link to this talk later

968
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,158
on if you want some very specific

969
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,879
kind of red team attacker details

970
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,159
i've got a lot in uh in that resource as

971
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,480
well

972
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,000
so once you've you've done that you

973
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,600
understand your environment

974
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,600
you're looking at the threats that are

975
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,879
relevant now you need to say well what

976
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,918
are we going to do about them

977
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,440
right um what steps are we going to take

978
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,880
to address these threats

979
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,039
and one of the biggest challenges is

980
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,000
getting this stuff out of your head

981
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,640
and onto paper so that it makes sense

982
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,640
right

983
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,120
because it's even if you just go through

984
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,720
those two nist dependencies it can be

985
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:58,479
overwhelming so how do you break that

986
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,880
that complexity down into simple

987
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,159
like data sets or collections of

988
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,080
elements that

989
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,240
that you can step back and say yeah we

990
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,399
need to act here and we're okay

991
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,200
over there i use xmind i know free mind

992
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,600
is a good tool in the space as well but

993
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,760
like

994
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,799
if i identify password spraying as a

995
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,200
threat which

996
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,960
here's a little secret it absolutely is

997
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,519
to your organization

998
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,880
um then i i might say well what are we

999
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,640
doing to prevent that

1000
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,200
are we training people to use strong

1001
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,880
passwords are we blacklisting certain

1002
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,559
passwords that we know an attacker is

1003
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,000
likely to try like

1004
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,600
summer 2020 exclamation point um

1005
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,760
are we using multi-factor to make it

1006
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,519
harder to launch that type of attack

1007
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,360
uh or have we been able to enable

1008
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,159
passwordless authentication so it's not

1009
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,320
even

1010
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,200
there's nothing to to target right

1011
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,639
there's a lot of things on the

1012
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,440
preventative side that you want to draw

1013
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,600
out

1014
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,840
but on the detective side what are we

1015
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,080
doing to detect it well maybe you've got

1016
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,959
a security information management tool

1017
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,840
in place that's

1018
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,279
looking for that type of attack right

1019
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,158
one

1020
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,159
password launched against all the uh the

1021
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,760
user accounts in your environment

1022
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,679
but what are your third parties doing

1023
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,760
maybe that's a blind spot so

1024
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,280
see now you can start to say we've got

1025
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,000
this in hand we're doing this

1026
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,879
control but wait over here we've got a

1027
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,480
gap

1028
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,000
uh and then what are we going to do when

1029
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,199
we detect it if you don't know what null

1030
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,520
routing is

1031
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,879
don't jump right in you might say if i

1032
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,879
see somebody doing it

1033
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,279
they're definitely bad i don't want to

1034
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,598
accept any traffic from their ip

1035
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,399
tread lightly because you can

1036
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,599
inadvertently do some damage but

1037
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,199
use a mind mapping tool to uh to just

1038
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,440
start putting order

1039
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,879
around these these threats that you've

1040
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,679
identified

1041
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,598
and then you want to analyze your attack

1042
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,760
surface right you want to get

1043
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,639
more detail about what's out there above

1044
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,960
and beyond that

1045
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,960
kind of attacker's perspective i do a

1046
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,639
lot of ocean gathering um between

1047
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,560
showdown and census

1048
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,760
you're going to have a pretty good idea

1049
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,880
of what attackers

1050
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,560
know you have on the internet uh dns

1051
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,680
dumpster and fine sub domains

1052
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,440
are a good complement to that uh between

1053
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,399
those or among those four tools you get

1054
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,640
a lot of

1055
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,000
these are the systems and ports that are

1056
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,920
exposed externally

1057
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,920
in other words these are places you can

1058
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,760
log in if you want to attack us

1059
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,440
uh and then because you work for your

1060
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,200
organization you're not limited

1061
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,800
to passivo do some active nmap scans

1062
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,200
right do a full

1063
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,160
poor scan of uh your internet facing

1064
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,359
systems right

1065
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,960
don't break anything but see

1066
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,200
what ports you can identify that have

1067
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,119
been exposed externally

1068
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,240
see what systems like non-prod

1069
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,920
especially

1070
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,279
have been exposed externally that you

1071
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,200
can

1072
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,839
maybe take offline and then do just that

1073
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,240
right but before you get too deep

1074
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,759
into this exercise right even as you go

1075
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,959
through that first pass of all the

1076
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,640
threats and

1077
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,320
you're you're doing maybe say you settle

1078
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,160
on stride so you're going through and

1079
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,079
doing stride for each one and

1080
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,440
helping to kind of score how bad they

1081
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,800
look at your environment in your

1082
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,079
environment

1083
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,599
how worried you are about them um

1084
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,599
you can do some cleanup

1085
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,520
concurrently right you don't have to

1086
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,960
wait until the whole threat modeling

1087
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,880
exercise is done

1088
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,560
if you know you have network ports

1089
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,480
exposed externally

1090
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,799
that an attacker could use to try to log

1091
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,800
into internal systems but there's no

1092
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,839
legitimate business purpose you you're

1093
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,599
allowed to submit a ticket to say can we

1094
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,799
close that that network port right you

1095
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,839
don't have to wait

1096
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,640
until you get through your threat

1097
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,200
modeling exercise if you know that

1098
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,319
you can again reduce your uh your

1099
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,720
exposure

1100
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,079
you can do the same with apps that can

1101
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,319
either be taken offline if they're

1102
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,800
exposed externally or maybe moved

1103
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,920
uh internal hiding behind vpn or come up

1104
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,000
with some other way to

1105
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,839
to access it may put about one of your

1106
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,839
cloud environments

1107
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,960
uh disabling inactive accounts is a

1108
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,119
gimme

1109
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,960
right if you have accounts that belong

1110
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,160
to people who don't work at your company

1111
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,240
anymore

1112
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,078
and you don't have any any reason they

1113
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,078
got to be careful if they've got

1114
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,920
business processes that someone hard

1115
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,680
coded their account into

1116
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,359
be delicate with that cleanup but you

1117
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,319
can kick that initiative off as soon as

1118
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,920
you start

1119
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,520
your threat modeling process you you

1120
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,520
don't need to wait there

1121
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,720
and then reducing privilege right taking

1122
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,079
away privileges

1123
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,759
folks don't need if you find that

1124
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,760
they're over entitled or

1125
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,040
uh if their account has too much access

1126
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,720
right part of your

1127
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,920
your remediation stage your stage uh

1128
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,399
three of addressing your your threats

1129
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,680
is closing things down and just as a

1130
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,880
matter of good hygiene

1131
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,680
you know you can do this stuff right

1132
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,520
away one of the more challenging things

1133
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,720
that infosec pros have to

1134
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,839
consider though is there is cost and

1135
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,959
benefit

1136
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,078
in play here right if if you look at

1137
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,240
um all the threats you've identified and

1138
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,839
and you come up with safeguards or

1139
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,200
controls that you think are going to be

1140
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,440
useful uh if you're going into that with

1141
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,040
no consideration the cost

1142
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,880
then you're going to be sorely

1143
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,480
disappointed when management or

1144
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,599
leadership says yeah we just we can't

1145
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,240
afford that

1146
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,640
or we can't uh justify spending that

1147
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,560
much money to protect that resource

1148
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,400
now if it's a matter of physical safety

1149
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,839
or loss of life whole different

1150
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,400
conversation

1151
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,400
but there is a cost benefit analysis to

1152
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,240
be done so that you can determine

1153
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,520
whether or not you're overspending or

1154
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,680
underspending

1155
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,359
on the the solutions you're proposing so

1156
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,040
bring that to bear when you get to this

1157
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,200
stage of the process

1158
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,279
and then the validation right sooner or

1159
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,680
later you've you've got to go back and

1160
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,920
um

1161
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,839
i know some of you may know this proverb

1162
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,400
uh it was actually made popular by

1163
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,440
reagan

1164
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,000
in the 80s right trust by verify

1165
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,000
that's right uh the the u.s president in

1166
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,680
the 80s was using a russian

1167
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,960
uh proverb uh reasons for that but

1168
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,720
i got separate conversation uh don't

1169
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,720
just assume

1170
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,640
that when you tell people hey we've gone

1171
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,680
through the threat modeling exercise

1172
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,720
here are the things that we should do uh

1173
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,078
don't assume that they're just

1174
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,078
automatically going to get done you've

1175
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,839
got to go back and take a look

1176
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,920
the those technical scans are going to

1177
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,040
help some of that if you've taken stuff

1178
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,320
offline

1179
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,040
um i would go even deeper instead of

1180
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,480
just like poor scans with that map

1181
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,680
deep authenticated scans this can

1182
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,720
actually

1183
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,879
arguably be pulled forward into the the

1184
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,399
analysis

1185
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,079
it's tricky because threat modeling is

1186
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,480
more of a

1187
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,079
a conceptual exercise than the amount of

1188
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,560
the the technical

1189
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,240
uh resources you bring to bear it can

1190
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,560
make the process

1191
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,359
too cumbersome on the front end but at

1192
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,040
some point

1193
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,440
you do want that technical data because

1194
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,279
it's real it's an actual representation

1195
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,280
of what your environment looks like

1196
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,800
and when it comes to scans you should

1197
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,440
absolutely be doing

1198
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,040
authenticated scans of your hosts and

1199
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,800
you should be doing

1200
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,240
unauthenticated scans of production

1201
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,640
facing web apps

1202
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,720
and authenticated scans of

1203
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,000
non-production instances of those same

1204
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,000
web apps

1205
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,800
without an authenticated scan of a web

1206
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,920
app you're uh you're missing a huge

1207
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,720
portion of your attack surface um

1208
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,240
but you you can take this data in uh and

1209
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,598
use it to verify whether or not certain

1210
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,479
things have been done and you can also

1211
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,160
feed it

1212
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,760
into the next iteration of your threat

1213
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,640
modeling exercise

1214
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,000
um you can test whether certain actions

1215
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,879
have been taken through user awareness

1216
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,640
training

1217
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,920
right we talked about uh user

1218
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,920
interaction being so

1219
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,720
common with actual attacks against

1220
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,439
organizations

1221
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,799
so uh through a lunch and learn whether

1222
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,560
it's physical whether it's virtual

1223
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,400
through online training

1224
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,599
social engineering simulations with

1225
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,800
tools like

1226
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,359
covants or know before

1227
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,480
social engineers toolkit still free out

1228
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,400
on github

1229
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,000
right just test and see whether or not

1230
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,040
users are falling for some of those

1231
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,200
identity

1232
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,480
based attacks right when you come up

1233
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,240
with the threats

1234
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,720
and say yeah we think this is really bad

1235
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,680
here um you can emulate

1236
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,279
some of those uh attacks exploiting or

1237
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,000
using those threats as your

1238
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,119
the basis for the attack and determine

1239
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,760
how resilient

1240
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,520
your organization and your users really

1241
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,119
are

1242
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,839
part of that testing goes above and

1243
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,000
beyond just basic simulations though

1244
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,000
deep dive pen test absolutely whether

1245
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,800
it's an internal red team

1246
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,680
whether it's a third party that has a

1247
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,160
specialty

1248
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,680
deep experience in pen testing you want

1249
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,480
to bring that to bear

1250
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,839
i'll be a fan of the pen test execution

1251
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,800
standard till the day i die

1252
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,200
it is so good this little grassroots

1253
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,839
thing

1254
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,598
it just gives you guidance around how to

1255
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,599
run a pen test and you can see

1256
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,720
threat modeling has been considered a

1257
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,480
part of the pen test

1258
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,279
standard for gosh since day one

1259
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,000
so if you're engaging a third party to

1260
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,440
do a pen

1261
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,200
test feed them your your threat modeling

1262
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,880
uh results right when you go through

1263
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,520
that exercise and you've

1264
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,800
captured all that information just hand

1265
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,040
it over and say

1266
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,079
this is the stuff we really care about

1267
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,359
hammer away

1268
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,119
i mean it may be a more embarrassing

1269
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,119
report if you look at pentest report

1270
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,760
that way but really that's not what pen

1271
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,720
testing is it's an education tool

1272
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,440
and that's just giving you a significant

1273
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,439
advantage

1274
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,920
right you're getting so much more value

1275
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,960
out of the time and money you invest

1276
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,119
if you're sharing that throughout

1277
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,720
modeling information and having a pen

1278
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,560
test that actually adheres to

1279
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,040
to that standard and then a few tools

1280
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,520
that

1281
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,640
uh i'd recommend you actually try on

1282
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,480
your own

1283
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,400
to give you some insight into uh

1284
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,599
into your environment and into an

1285
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,640
attacker's

1286
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,680
mindset discover is a great ocean

1287
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,319
gathering tool

1288
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,160
i used to use ntl on bother but i know

1289
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,920
if you pop a set of domain creds

1290
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,000
and get in and can hit the the domain

1291
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,079
controller crack map

1292
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,400
exec lets you launch a password spraying

1293
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,400
attack directly against a dc

1294
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,440
um against web interfaces you can use

1295
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,480
something like burp

1296
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,160
right the paid edition of burp uh to

1297
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,720
do a password spraying attack um and

1298
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,359
responder is a great uh little tool that

1299
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,759
if you're on the

1300
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,880
internal network takes advantage of the

1301
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,079
the chattiness

1302
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,560
of um ethernet to try to get creds um

1303
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,240
but

1304
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,920
just a few tools to check out again i've

1305
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,279
got a lot more in my hacking identity

1306
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,800
presentation but

1307
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,560
when it comes to validation don't just

1308
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,760
hand things over right get engaged roll

1309
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,520
your sleeves up

1310
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,680
give it a try so so what should you do

1311
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,480
next right now i'm giving you kind of

1312
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,560
here's some

1313
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,000
some methodologies and some resources

1314
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,000
around methodologies here's the process

1315
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,119
explore those various threat models and

1316
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,599
pick one

1317
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,599
that you want to try right don't try to

1318
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,280
do too much don't try to do everything

1319
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,400
just pick one and say hey we're going to

1320
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,599
go through a throughout modeling

1321
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,520
exercise

1322
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,119
where we pull some resources out of that

1323
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,040
nest stock and then we

1324
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,720
sit down with a group of people and try

1325
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,800
to figure this out

1326
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,118
so pick a methodology and draft an

1327
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,440
identity data flow diagram

1328
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,440
not a technical architecture diagram

1329
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,520
just a joint remove reliever

1330
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,119
uh workflow how do identities come into

1331
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,440
that business relationship with your

1332
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,560
organization where do they propagate

1333
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,280
accounts and entitlements uh and

1334
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,560
how do you manage changes and what do

1335
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,440
you do when somebody leaves

1336
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,920
right just a high level i've done this

1337
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,319
in

1338
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,480
maturity model assessments i do a lot of

1339
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,560
assessments of identity programs where i

1340
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,000
apply the capability maturity model

1341
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,400
and the identity defined security

1342
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,400
alliance framework

1343
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,920
to help organizations understand what

1344
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,880
they're doing and how well they're doing

1345
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,880
identity and we always front end that

1346
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,160
conversation with the data flow diagram

1347
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,400
just a real simple

1348
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,399
white board 20 30 minutes it's been eye

1349
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,079
opening every single time

1350
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,079
for the people in the room to say i did

1351
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,520
not realize that that's how that works i

1352
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,839
thought it was different

1353
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,920
um so do that at the beginning of your

1354
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,480
threat modeling exercise right

1355
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,480
just put that diagram together vet it

1356
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,079
with a couple of folks

1357
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,200
and then you know you've got to put a

1358
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,160
team together because you don't want to

1359
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,000
do this

1360
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,920
in isolation you don't want to do it in

1361
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,920
a vacuum you want to uh

1362
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,319
bring people in from the app side

1363
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,440
infrastructure your devops team

1364
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:30,560
um maybe uh you know legal right

1365
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,079
maybe uh um audit maybe human resources

1366
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,960
line of business right it's going to

1367
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,720
vary

1368
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,800
depending on your organization but it's

1369
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,279
also a chance to build relationships

1370
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,280
and help people understand why you're

1371
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,040
improving your identity infrastructure

1372
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,880
why you're making changes to the way

1373
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,960
they always did things

1374
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,160
because you're helping to provide

1375
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,520
resiliency

1376
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,839
you want to make sure they can do their

1377
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,920
jobs but you need to understand

1378
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,880
organizational level business process

1379
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,520
level and

1380
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,200
information systems level threats so

1381
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,240
that you can take action to

1382
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,078
address those threats and then prototype

1383
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,640
this threat modeling process by doing it

1384
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,760
just

1385
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,640
once if if you pick stride or you pick

1386
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,480
dread

1387
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,640
as the methodology you want to follow

1388
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,960
for your first threat modeling exercise

1389
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,839
you're not married to it for the next 10

1390
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,960
20 years

1391
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,880
right you can do it once and say yeah

1392
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,359
not for us and then go out to that

1393
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,280
carnegie mellon blog pick another one

1394
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,200
and you know just bounce back and forth

1395
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,400
until you find one that resonates with

1396
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,839
your team

1397
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,240
one that makes sense to your

1398
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,000
organization um so just do those four

1399
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,319
steps you know take a

1400
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
take this slide deck i've got some other

1401
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,520
resources i recommend if you don't know

1402
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,599
adam showstack

1403
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,720
hit this guy up on linkedin look him up

1404
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,280
on youtube

1405
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,839
he's got a number of classes on threat

1406
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,560
modeling

1407
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,599
on linkedin learning to go into detail

1408
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,920
he's even got a book

1409
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,520
designing for security that gets into

1410
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,760
threat modeling

1411
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,079
it's going to go into a lot more detail

1412
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,319
than i can go into in an hour but

1413
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,680
uh adam's the guy when it comes to

1414
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,759
threat modeling and

1415
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,799
you can learn a lot from what he has to

1416
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,560
offer

1417
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,160
i've got that link here out to the

1418
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,799
carnegie mellon blog

1419
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,440
a link to the nist document and then you

1420
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,160
know

1421
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,319
publicly available information is great

1422
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,399
if you can get involved in an isac

1423
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,240
uh specific to your industry you can get

1424
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,000
some insider knowledge around threats

1425
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,879
that people are running into

1426
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,599
right now so if your organization

1427
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,520
doesn't allow you to engage in an isac

1428
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,839
tell them i said they should because

1429
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,200
that's uh it's a gimme right it's just

1430
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,720
you're giving the attackers the

1431
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,759
advantage if you're not actively

1432
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,598
engaging in

1433
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,280
conversation with other professionals in

1434
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,680
your industry

1435
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,440
and if you're a leader uh put one of

1436
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,118
your people on this right

1437
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,960
you're the one who needs to fight for

1438
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,920
them to to get the budget in time to let

1439
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,200
them do it

1440
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,319
the value is absolutely there but get

1441
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,640
them engaged

1442
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,480
and then uh the last resource um lenny

1443
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,078
zeltzer's critical log review checklist

1444
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,319
for security incidents

1445
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,559
it's an oldie but a goodie uh it's it

1446
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,319
gives you some very specific things

1447
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,000
to look for on the response side that

1448
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,160
will help you kind of again

1449
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,280
reverse engineer well if i'm if i'm

1450
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,440
seeing this in the

1451
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,680
uh sim in the the event logs

1452
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,680
then what triggered that right what led

1453
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,078
to that it's a great resource to help

1454
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,160
round that out a couple of other

1455
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,800
resources here including the book

1456
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,200
identity attack vectors from a press it

1457
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,599
was

1458
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,919
written by darren rolls who was a former

another book uh privileged attack

1462
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,720
vectors

1463
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,319
that uh get into this topic in a lot

1464

more detail and

1465
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,319
i mentioned i've got my hacking identity

1466
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,480
talk out on the youtubes

1467
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,839
