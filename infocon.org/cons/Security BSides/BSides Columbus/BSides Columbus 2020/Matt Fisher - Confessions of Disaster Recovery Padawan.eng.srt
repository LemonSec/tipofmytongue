00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,720
welcome to besides columbus

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,839
and confessions of a disaster recovery

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,559
padawan

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:16,160
a tale of loss and regret but also of

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:18,080
resilience and hope

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,080
my name is matt fisher but i go by

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,439
fischer because there's always a lot of

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:30,000
mats

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:32,079
here are some things about me

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,160
if you paid for a b-sides ticket and you

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,239
want to contact me after today's session

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,319
you can email me at fisher cmh

13
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,839
gmail.com and let's say this offer is

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,840
best before

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
2021

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,600
being a little bit coy about my employer

17
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,599
because i didn't ask for permission

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
you could do this probably better than

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,359
me so you should give it a go

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,559
i'm not a drx bet i don't even play one

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,799
on tv

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,880
i'm not a lawyer not a doctor any

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,000
opinions or typos of my own

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,360
definitely not my employers you can

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
disagree and correct me

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,280
in the time for questions and that's all

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,040
good but please be kind and respectful

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,040
so we don't spoil it for anyone else

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,600
so i'm going to assume that you know

30
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,280
something about disaster recovery

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,280
and that you can google for things like

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
rto and load balancers and server

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
affinity

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,240
that's the help you need i'm sure there

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,798
are many great resources out there

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,679
but this isn't a dr explainer it's about

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
building a dr

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
program i have about three hours of

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,158
material on the cutting room floor

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,240
um so prequels and sequels

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
the order is not strictly linear here

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,880
and it's not an homage to the franchise

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,479
it's just the way it tumbled out

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,320
we'll begin with a narrative that sets

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,360
the scene um

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,798
maybe where you are right now um

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,280
and then we'll look at where we're

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,319
heading and the documents the tabletop

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,080
exercises and the failover tests this is

50
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,359
a really big topic so

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
these are pretty skinny and then we have

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,760
your quest

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
like how do you succeed at this how do

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:23,760
you begin how do you grow

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:26,239
how do you excel and then we're done

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,920
the first confession is i don't know

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
much about star wars

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
i watched the first three movies back in

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
the day but the rest of it sort of

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,640
passed me by

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
if you're watching this in a star wars

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
costume because you thought this was

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
about jedi's

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,160
then i apologize you will load here

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
under false pretenses

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
but for those of you that came here for

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,319
disaster recovery

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
let's get started

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,239
let's talk about these graphics the

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
poster ideas for promoting dr and

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,879
business continuity events

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,680
internally it's quite in keeping with

73
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,399
our culture

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,000
but it may not fit yours but if it does

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,440
something think about adding some

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,239
match stickers and whatnot

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,480
that particular poster is uh is a riff

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,879
on the movie 28 days later

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,518
we had this pandemic tabletop exercise

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,518
schedule for march 2020

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,599
but real life events kind of over took

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
us so we canceled that there was really

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,040
no need

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
and that's worth noting if your event is

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,359
eclipsed by a real life situation

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,959
then you can skip your event i mean you

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,519
already tested your plan

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,799
in the real event no one's gonna thank

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,799
you for making them

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,239
relive it again in practice mode right

91
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,200
afterwards

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
something to think about

93
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,319
i had this big story arc narrative that

94
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,200
was

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,640
was gonna explain some fictional startup

96
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,238
not the one i work at

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,559
um you know i'm gonna say you're not

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,040
brand new so you've been around for five

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,680
ten fifteen years you're not cloud

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,519
native

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,920
so you know so much easier these days

102
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
right

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,439
these cloud kids um

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,280
you had startup priorities so did it

105
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,920
make sense to invest in dr when you

106
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,840
maybe

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,760
weren't going to even make rent next

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,639
month then you get this big customer

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,358
really makes you up your game right

110
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,160
moves you into a proper data center

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,638
out of your garage and um you know so

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
your

113
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
color out there and maybe second data

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
center

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,040
in time but this big customer is making

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,359
you jump through

117
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
compliance hoops and you know that feels

118
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
like a compliance risk

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
like a pressure on the business forcing

120
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,560
you to do the right thing

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and i'm kind of okay with that that's a

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,040
control

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,880
yeah so data centers first data center

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,479
second data center for resilience their

125
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
data sentence to cloud

126
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
but no second region in the cloud that

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
would be a fourth data center and that's

128
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,960
just crazy

129
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
but the resilience implications of

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
running out of one data center

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,320
means you're still tied to a

132
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,000
geographical region

133
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,759
and then those unlikely threats with the

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,919
compliance um

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,919
so i had i had a lot to talk about here

136
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,599
but it kind of ended up on the cutting

137
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,039
room floor

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,039
so we're going to gloss over this

139
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,919
now we have the evolution of the

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,198
controls themselves and this pretty much

141
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,919
follows the arc of

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,479
of the company of your startup so we

143
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,320
start off quite modestly

144
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,719
and then there's more sophisticated

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,919
sophistication added right we've got the

146
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,840
the clustering and the load balancing

147
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,240
and you know we've got the pools and the

148
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,679
farms and we're able to write out those

149
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,960
single node

150
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,360
failures pretty well but then you get

151
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,758
some

152
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
larger techpocalypse and your fault

153
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,919
tolerance just

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,198
can't save you so you just created in

155
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,880
your data center

156
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,960
and you don't yet have that second data

157
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,560
center so you just got nowhere else to

158
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,400
go when your customers are

159
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,759
raising eyebrows at the time it takes

160
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,080
for you to recover

161
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,440
um and that's that's when that second

162
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,520
data center becomes

163
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,000
a real thing business continuity i mean

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,919
it's

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,520
there's some discussion about you know

166
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,560
disaster recovery is certainly

167
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,919
a component of business continuity

168
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,080
but if you don't have that business

169
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,680
continuity already in place

170
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,880
you can't draw from it i mean you're

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
going to be feeding it right you're

172
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,520
going to be finding

173
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,359
finding out the criticality of things

174
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,359
and the single points of failure

175
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
perhaps before business continuity comes

176
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,680
along

177
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,720
and clouds and containers we may not

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,639
have started with that but it's

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,560
definitely something we have to do

180
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,039
our devon engineering talent pretty much

181
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,479
demands it they've got a future proof

182
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,840
we can't let them play with those

183
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,440
features here then they're going to go

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,359
somewhere else and do it

185
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,719
so every time we replace some system or

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,840
build some new products

187
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,160
we're thinking cloud fast

188
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,159
and and retention of that talent is is a

189
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,800
business continuity concern and it's

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,800
legitimate

191
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,360
okay and now everyone's favorite

192
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,799
documentation

193
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
you are going to need different

194
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,919
documents for different purposes

195
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,719
you're going to need a an executive

196
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,599
summary

197
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,960
of the program no more than two pages i

198
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,719
recommend you work on that now

199
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
instead of waiting until you're asked to

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,919
deliver it in five minutes time

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,080
um your future self will thank you

202
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,440
the dr plan is the big kahuna it's an

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,599
enormous document

204
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,599
um start now even if you're just putting

205
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,960
in the skeleton of headings and

206
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
placeholders

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,479
the things you might might think you're

208
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,758
going to need

209
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,479
i'm wary of describing this

210
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,360
too well because a it will take up all

211
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,758
of the time

212
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,080
and b they're usually proprietary and

213
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
protected by non-disclosure agreements

214
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,359
but of course you can find templates and

215
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,359
advice

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,080
around the place and you can look at

217
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,280
what your customers are asking for and

218
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,280
what your framework

219
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,520
is looking for and you can you can key

220
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,719
off that but just get started

221
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,560
because you're going to be adding and

222
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
adding and adding to this over time and

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
building it up

224
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,479
and it is going to be a huge

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
collaboration with many other people

226
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,919
even if they're not wanting to come to

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
the table early they are at some point

228
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,400
going to have to own their piece

229
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
and i would say that this document is

230
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,198
likely

231
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,359
you know it's going to summarize things

232
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,919
with overviews at the beginning

233
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,479
that describes all the things and then

234
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,919
all of

235
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
each of the things is going to have its

236
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,679
own appendix or chapter

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,240
um that somebody owns it's their piece

238
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,679
um and it might be on a need-to-know

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
basis so that might be the only piece

240
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,079
that they

241
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,320
see so you're going to have some rigor

242
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,279
around you know the collaboration

243
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560
of this one of the things that's

244
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,760
definitely going to be in there is the

245
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,199
criticality

246
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,200
what does the business care about the

247
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
most what's the most important thing

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
and make sure that those are are

249
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,560
outlined and make sure that if there's

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,040
any metrics around them you know

251
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,239
sort of slas and commitments and

252
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,160
requirements like your

253
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,959
regulatory stuff and your contractual

254
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,839
stuff and describe what compliance looks

255
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,160
like and what not

256
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,160
non-compliance looks like and some idea

257
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,800
of what the impact is if you don't meet

258
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,800
compliance

259
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,399
and the failover runebook is for us

260
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,760
today the most important of

261
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,000
of those appendixes appendices um

262
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,160
it is the step-by-step instructions of

263
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
how to get from data center a to data

264
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,319
center b

265
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,279
once once a disaster has been declared

266
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,720
how to turn down

267
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,360
a how to get things ready how to stand

268
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,240
at b

269
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
how to validate you know and that gap is

270
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
is the latency

271
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
between running from a and running for b

272
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,399
um

273
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,839
so the failover runbook the step-by-step

274
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
instructions that are to be followed

275
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,000
and then compliance records right so the

276
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,000
very least it's your

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,079
your version histories of the documents

278
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,600
you know and it will review perhaps and

279
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,640
sign off

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,800
maybe there's minutes

281
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,240
recorded if that's your culture and

282
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,839
again you can look at the sort of things

283
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,959
that your framework or customers or

284
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
compliance people

285
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,479
are asking for what is the document set

286
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,640
that they expect to see

287
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,360
for a dr program and you know achieve

288
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,360
that checklist

289
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,120
tabletop exercises as a real bread and

290
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,480
butter

291
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,320
of your dr program

292
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,240
i mean they're just pretend right there

293
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,399
it's a paper exercise the intellectual

294
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,959
process of going through the run book

295
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,959
line by line and just making sure that

296
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,399
it's right that it's going to work and

297
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,239
doing that regularly

298
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,240
so you're testing the run books the

299
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
documents to make sure they're still

300
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
fit for purpose you're going to do this

301
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,680
with real participants i mean you're

302
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,760
going to pull

303
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,439
the sort of people that are going to get

304
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
paid the engineers and the devs that get

305
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
paged in a real life situation

306
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
you're going to pull those into a room

307
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,439
or onto a call

308
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
and you're going to go through this

309
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
together and they're going to speak to

310
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
their part

311
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
of the failover process and it's all to

312
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,680
improve their readiness

313
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,800
so you want the uh you want those people

314
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,880
essentially getting trained up in this

315
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,800
um and that's incident response training

316
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,640
the disaster is the incident and the

317
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,479
failover is the response

318
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,120
so this is just simply an incident

319
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,519
scenario that we that we rehearse

320
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
um so don't have it be the same person

321
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,760
from the team

322
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,120
turning up every time i mean make sure

323
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,360
you rotate through the team

324
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,680
and be clear i mean are we going there

325
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
and back in our tabletop exercises and i

326
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,760
really

327
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,079
think you should because there's a girl

328
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,160
leg and a return leg they're not

329
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,160
just mirror images of each other it's

330
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,240
always more complicated than that

331
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,760
so make sure you practice in both

332
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,600
directions

333
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,800
and compliance what are your compliance

334
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,519
folks need

335
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,199
to you know to properly register the

336
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,279
fact that these are taking place

337
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,279
just ask them and then provide it

338
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,240
let's look at some of the key roles that

339
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,200
are needed in the tabletop exercise

340
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,519
because you really

341
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,040
can't do all of this on your on your own

342
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,320
you're you're really going to need

343
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,439
some help and i will say that because of

344
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
reasons of culture

345
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,240
you know some of these names might not

346
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,160
be the sort of thing you'd find in your

347
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,279
corporates because you don't have like a

348
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,279
chief unicorn officer or something so

349
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,360
don't worry about the the title so much

350
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,120
just appreciate what the rules are

351
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,360
so we have a quarterback we have a

352
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,440
scribe we have comms

353
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,639
we have a party planner we have a witch

354
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,240
hunter general

355
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,240
and we have a disaster master

356
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,800
let's look at the quarterback rule

357
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,279
that's what we call the person running

358
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,639
the incident so the incident lead

359
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,639
and they're going to be calling out what

360
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,279
happens next and really directing

361
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,880
the effort now that should all be

362
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,000
written down in the run book so they're

363
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,920
going to be following

364
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,839
that run book it's a trained position

365
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,719
right there's some training involved in

366
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,320
leading an incident um and our incident

367
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
response

368
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,160
program trains incident leads or

369
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
quarterbacks so we simply reach out to

370
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,800
them

371
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
and we ask them for a freshly minted

372
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,560
quarterback to you know be nominated to

373
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,000
come and join the next tabletop

374
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,319
exercise and it's it's good training

375
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
for them and it's it's a win-win

376
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,800
let's take a look at the scribes role i

377
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
think it's arguably the most tiring role

378
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
because you're keeping the running

379
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,519
record of the event so you're listening

380
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,319
and typing

381
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,680
at the same time for most of the time so

382
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,920
chat is really your friend

383
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,439
i like i like to open a document and

384
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,560
can't pierce from the chat

385
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
and i scrub out the banter on the emojis

386
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,959
and whatnot

387
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,639
and preserve that record as we go along

388
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,000
and if there's any wrinkle in the run

389
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,519
book where we say we're gonna have to

390
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,519
fix that and update that i mean

391
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,079
we keep going in the tabletop exercise

392
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,720
but we need to circle back and fix that

393
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,000
so um scribe you keep a running list of

394
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,440
all of those things

395
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
and that's going to be the basis of the

396
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,560
retro at the end

397
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,399
so the scribe needs to be paying

398
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,518
attention so when there's too much

399
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,880
chatter going on you've really got to

400
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,720
hush people

401
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,079
so you can concentrate and that retro

402
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,079
that list at the end i mean it's the

403
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,279
last 30 minutes of the tabletop

404
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
and we're going to work through that

405
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,800
list very quickly

406
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,360
and we just need a high medium or low

407
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,160
determination and probably put a name on

408
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,399
that

409
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,399
um and the time so you can refer to the

410
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,639
record so you can get some context

411
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,320
if anybody is unsure about how to work

412
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,120
that ticket

413
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,560
and then at some point um in the coming

414
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,000
days the scribe's going to have to

415
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,319
publish that record as part of

416
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,240
documentation for the event

417
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,079
subscribe is not a difficult role but it

418
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,079
is it is continuous work

419
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,518
the comms roll the communications roll

420
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,560
doesn't really have a lot to do during

421
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,639
the tabletop

422
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,399
exercise because nothing's really

423
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,360
happening because we're just

424
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,800
pretending right there's nobody banging

425
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,079
on the door for updates

426
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
so but they're gonna shield the

427
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,399
quarterback um from that sort of outside

428
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,839
pressure in a real event

429
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
that would be their job they've probably

430
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,839
got one you know

431
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
probably present in there in the field

432
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,360
of a

433
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,800
uh room and they've probably also got

434
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
one foot in the marketing and

435
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,160
communications room as well they're in

436
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
both meetings and there are years in

437
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,759
between the two

438
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,199
all right so they're gonna have to

439
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,120
summarize the situation for the

440
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,079
non-technical stakeholders

441
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,440
outside of the room um it's it's

442
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,399
important right because executives are

443
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,440
going to need to know

444
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,120
what's going on and where are we in etas

445
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,880
updates all that kind of stuff that

446
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,880
people are going to going to need coming

447
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,199
out of the room

448
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,360
um so the comms role person doing that

449
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,839
means that the quarterback can focus on

450
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,759
the actual failover

451
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,160
and it goes both ways right so there

452
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,880
might be external events that are

453
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,600
pertinent

454
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,320
and so you know the comms person can

455
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,680
communicate

456
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,000
outside to the room as well now

457
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,839
in in practice everybody's on twitter

458
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,880
and email and the grapevine anyway right

459
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,000
so it's

460
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,519
it's all going to get there before the

461
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
comps officer but that that is their

462
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,759
role

463
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,439
it's a party planners role it's huge

464
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
should really chop it up into a few

465
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
people

466
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,720
um i mean so much work here so i mean

467
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,959
you got just all the room booking and

468
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,600
scheduling that that has to happen that

469
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,439
in itself there's a bit much

470
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
you've got to do so you know announce it

471
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,399
and invite people

472
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,680
if you're going to invite people you're

473
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,440
going to have to have the right people

474
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,279
there so it's the right mix of people

475
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,920
from the different tech teams and

476
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,959
rotating the participation and all of

477
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,439
that kind of stuff

478
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,079
and i will say it's tempting to just

479
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,839
write to them

480
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,920
the managers of the directors and say

481
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,720
hey here are the people that i need

482
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,319
but in a bottom-up community driven

483
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,240
culture like that that

484
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,959
is not gonna work you're gonna get some

485
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,559
backlash so you call for volunteers

486
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,799
and you you let people volunteer

487
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,559
themselves and if that doesn't work

488
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,799
because your last resort to get

489
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,399
rears in seats then maybe maybe you try

490
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,280
that top-down approach

491
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
uh schedule the day like have some sort

492
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,959
of plan

493
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
um you know how it's going to work out

494
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,319
and then you've got to manage that day

495
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,080
you've got to manage that schedule

496
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,360
and i thought anybody's interested i

497
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,199
mean hit me up for

498
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,719
for how i do it just a suggested

499
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,799
starting point there's there's a lot

500
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,679
goes into managing the day

501
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:43,520
um all sorts of things to consider um

502
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,120
and so it's not a technical role anybody

503
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,520
who's reasonably

504
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,559
organized and assertive can be the party

505
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
planner

506
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,678
um it doesn't have to be and that's a

507
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,679
great way of getting non-technical

508
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,559
people into the dr program as well is

509
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,559
the roles like this

510
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,799
witch hunter general the most

511
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,160
unglamorous and thankless task

512
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
you're going to chase those retro

513
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,640
tickets

514
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,840
that's it really there are different

515
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
kinds of issues

516
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,199
that we're going to find in the retro

517
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,039
the vast majority of them are going to

518
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,200
be updates to the runbook like

519
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,400
tweak the documentation or get it up

520
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,320
today

521
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,840
sometimes we tweak the process itself

522
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,000
that's all good

523
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,439
sometimes there's a legit technical

524
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,360
problem that surfaces

525
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,120
and okay that needs some engineering or

526
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,678
code or something

527
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,159
and then we're you know those ice bags

528
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,400
those

529
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,000
those real big blockers um that are

530
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,480
really hindering our ability to fill

531
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,160
over those architectural and systemic or

532
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,559
legacy issues

533
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,120
um there that are really slowness down

534
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,879
and then capture those

535
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,559
and then those retro tickets right

536
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,240
you've gotta gotta explain them right

537
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,639
you gotta you gotta chirp on people like

538
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
hey

539
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
this ticket it's three weeks old or

540
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,320
three months old and then the person who

541
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,679
got

542
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,678
got it assigned is going to say what

543
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,559
does this even mean and you got to be

544
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
able to

545
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,840
explain that but thankfully from your

546
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
retro

547
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,120
somebody put a name on it and somebody

548
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,439
put a time on it and you can refer to

549
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,039
the record and get some context

550
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,600
or at least bring somebody else in that

551
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,320
can give that context

552
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,399
but remember witch hunters it is it is

553
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,399
not on you to fix the thing

554
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,120
right your job is to make sure that all

555
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,559
the findings get some sort of attention

556
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,239
and if they're not going to get done

557
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,678
then you know you can just discard and

558
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,440
close out those tickets

559
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,679
but don't just let the tickets sit out

560
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
there

561
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,399
the disaster master role is for me the

562
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
most fun

563
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,679
it's like being dungeon master in

564
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,679
dungeons and dragons

565
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,039
so you come up with this scenario some

566
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,840
reason why we're being

567
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,039
forced to fail over rain and make it

568
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,199
something plausible

569
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,400
you know realistic enough but different

570
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,640
and don't don't have a fire every time

571
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,559
and you really want to you really want

572
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,720
to take the table tops into places that

573
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,760
are uncomfortable and surface issues

574
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,440
right i mean not

575
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,679
in the very beginning just keep it

576
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,039
simple um you don't need to do that

577
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,320
there's enough work to do but once you

578
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,320
get into a regular pattern and you're

579
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,480
feeling reasonably on top of it

580
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,000
then challenge everybody by going to the

581
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,440
hard places

582
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,880
and you'll get a lot more out of it

583
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,120
throw in some kf balls i mean take away

584
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,200
phones and video conference or something

585
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,600
like that halfway through like

586
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,960
have a storage array go down just

587
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,240
something to get people

588
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,640
thinking on their feet and do make it

589
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,799
fun

590
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,000
right it's the biggest opportunity to

591
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,120
make this fun

592
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
so um come up with something interesting

593
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,120
and don't forget comms i mean make sure

594
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,960
that i don't know as part of your

595
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,918
scenario the co

596
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,360
like she needs regular updates on the

597
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,039
hour and a half past the hour about

598
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,439
what's going on where your progress is

599
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,799
and etas and stuff like that so

600
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,720
if you can try and make the

601
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
communications person work for this

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,840
that brings us to the data center feel

603
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,439
of a test itself

604
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,280
it's a real event you're really going to

605
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,600
swing over to the secondary data center

606
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,200
and you're really going to have downtime

607
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,879
it's a planned event right it's in the

608
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,039
calendar as opposed to an

609
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,320
unplanned event where lightning strikes

610
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,360
disaster's cold

611
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,360
and we're going to fail over in the

612
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,479
middle of the day

613
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,080
customer communications this is key

614
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,600
you're going to have to get the message

615
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,918
out there you're going to have to

616
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,520
shepherd that through your marketing and

617
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,640
communications

618
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,480
folks and then through your your

619
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
customer relationship managers if you

620
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,280
know who they are

621
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,639
even and that's going to take some time

622
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,639
and then you need to be giving your

623
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,159
customers on a 60 days notice or

624
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,159
whatever your contract says

625
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,480
so you need to start this months ahead

626
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,120
of time and so you really need a plan

627
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,159
for this and you really need somebody on

628
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,799
top of it

629
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,120
and if you don't i mean the business is

630
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,760
going to hear about it from customers

631
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,840
and don't neglect your your unmanaged

632
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,679
accounts as well right those users that

633
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,520
signed up to the to the website

634
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,679
um although their terms of service don't

635
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,158
say they get notification necessarily

636
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,919
um you want to get that message out

637
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,039
there with web banners and emails and

638
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,559
stuff

639
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,720
otherwise they're going to be you know

640
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,399
flooding you 100 number voicemail

641
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,480
or help out email address and it's hard

642
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
to declare a successful fail of a test

643
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,600
when some of the department is jumping

644
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,480
up and down about the impact

645
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,480
that you calls them

646
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,440
the night itself there's plenty to do

647
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,840
consider having

648
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,440
a party planner just for the night right

649
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,918
just to make sure that garage doors are

650
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
open

651
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,760
pizza is delivered and the rooms cleared

652
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,360
up all that kind of stuff

653
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,600
the retro don't hang around for the

654
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,320
retro it the invite should have gone out

655
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,678
weeks ago

656
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,760
so that you know a few days later

657
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,039
midweek the following week is when you

658
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,640
bring people together and go through

659
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,840
that retro list

660
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,039
right you're not going to keep people

661
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,280
around and you're not going to keep your

662
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,760
scribe around to tidy up the record or

663
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,440
the

664
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,799
you know the retro list right give them

665
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,559
a couple of days

666
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,120
as long as it happens before the retro

667
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,120
that's fine

668
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,679
prepare for failure just to seem obvious

669
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,080
to dear people

670
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,440
failovers don't always succeed plan for

671
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,120
that failure

672
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,880
this really goes all the way back to

673
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,239
selecting a date and communicating it

674
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,799
out to customers

675
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,840
you really need at least two days uh

676
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,440
communicated and accepted out there

677
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,720
you know if it all works great on the

678
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,360
first night and you don't need that

679
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,120
second

680
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,959
do-over date that's fine just just

681
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,639
cancel it that's easy

682
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,000
but if you have to back out and you need

683
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,000
that do-over

684
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
i mean it's really hard to scramble to

685
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,039
get that

686
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,440
in short notice right so it's just

687
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,440
horrible

688
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,678
you have all these decision points uh

689
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,799
where you do get to back out right in

690
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,880
the run up to

691
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,200
the fill of a test and in the fill of a

692
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,400
test itself so you need to identify

693
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,320
those opportunities to back out

694
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
and put those in the timeline and also

695
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,120
the criteria under which you should back

696
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,200
out

697
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,039
so that the quarterback doesn't have

698
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,840
that judgment all on their shoulders

699
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,840
right

700
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,039
make it easy what happens if you exceed

701
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,799
your change window

702
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,080
maybe it's no big deal maybe there are

703
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,559
penalties for that and you need to

704
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,678
declare an incident instead

705
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,039
know these things if you need to send

706
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,320
out any communications

707
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,720
make sure they're pre-canned

708
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:32,320
pre-approved they're in the run book so

709
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:35,279
it's easy to execute on that too

710
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,799
the dr event calendar i recommend

711
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,120
scheduling your events

712
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,799
a year out even if you haven't

713
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,000
communicated them a year out

714
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,400
like just to know um where they're gonna

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,960
fall

716
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,240
in which quarter and it's mostly table

717
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,279
top exercises

718
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,880
right so aim for one per quarter two of

719
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,799
those scenarios your

720
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,320
failed data center your primary still

721
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,559
present any one of them

722
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,439
like it's gone it's a smart crater or

723
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,000
something it's just not there

724
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
one of your tabletop exercises is that

725
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,440
rehearsal

726
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,039
um for the fill of a test so that's a

727
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,080
that's a freebie there's no scenario

728
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,679
there

729
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,840
and then you've got your actual fill of

730
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,440
a test um

731
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,279
i mean if you don't think you can do it

732
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,799
biannually buy yourself some time

733
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,799
so pretty straightforward

734
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
so how do we get started well we we

735
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,559
start small

736
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,400
it could be just a couple of engineers

737
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,000
that are really worried about how

738
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,640
they're going to be able to fail over

739
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,559
their systems if disaster strikes

740
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,000
and i call these you know the consent

741
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,879
citizens and they're

742
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,880
they're very committed they're worried

743
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,880
about their own systems primarily but

744
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
they have dependencies as well

745
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,240
and they can reach out horizontally to

746
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,840
other engineers

747
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,840
and bring them in too

748
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,480
so don't worry if you hit some seemingly

749
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,799
intractable problem

750
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,720
uh just just pivot to something that you

751
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,200
can work on it's important to just

752
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,480
keep moving that big problem let me mark

753
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,279
it as such

754
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,279
and keep going

755
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,158
you've got to be documenting um you know

756
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,559
just start putting this runbook together

757
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,720
version one it can be scrappy uh you're

758
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,760
gonna iterate and refine

759
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,760
just write it all down

760
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,760
you knock on some doors and get more

761
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,039
people involved and explain what you're

762
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,879
trying to achieve and why

763
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,200
and it will make sense to people

764
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,799
try with some small mini tabletops i

765
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,400
mean maybe it's just you and one other

766
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,639
engineer working through

767
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,080
step by step their system until they're

768
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
happy and you want to add that to the

769
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,720
run book

770
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,120
and maybe you build from their small

771
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
groups

772
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,080
so how do we grow the team no

773
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,918
you ask for help right you need some

774
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,520
volunteer firefighters that are

775
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,559
interested enough

776
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,918
to donate some part-time hours in

777
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,918
addition to their day job

778
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,000
and you're aiming for that first full

779
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,679
tabletop exercise so you need to get to

780
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,159
the point where your runbook is

781
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,200
pretty much end to end the failover

782
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,200
process

783
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,880
and then you can schedule this fast

784
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,360
tabletop

785
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,440
and it's as much to introduce people to

786
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,399
the process of the tabletop

787
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,080
and to the idea that a planned failover

788
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,559
is something that everybody needs to

789
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,559
practice

790
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,520
and then it's continuous improvement i

791
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
mean you're going to have a ton of

792
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,799
findings

793
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,600
every time but that's continuous growth

794
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,679
right you're going to be

795
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,039
drawing more people into this process

796
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,039
and your coverage is going to grow

797
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,600
and you need to keep documenting you

798
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,840
need to keep maintaining that run book

799
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,000
and you need to delegate the ownership

800
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,279
of the different parts of that run book

801
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,720
onto some of these teams and then you've

802
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,760
got to iterate and you just gotta

803
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,520
keep doing it

804
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,600
so the failover runbook is in pretty

805
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,080
good shape and you've had a couple of

806
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,199
tabletop exercises and the process is

807
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,279
working

808
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,039
but it's only been possible because of

809
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,799
all the volunteer help

810
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,480
there's no way one person was going to

811
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,279
do this on their own part-time i mean

812
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,399
they would

813
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,080
just burn out so how do you sustain

814
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,158
that volunteer help so we introduced the

815
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,799
idea of stewardship

816
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,720
stewards or co-owners of the program

817
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,120
they get to shape it

818
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,440
and it's a one-year commitment so we ask

819
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,520
maybe a dozen volunteers

820
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,840
if they will make this commitment of

821
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,960
four tabletop exercises

822
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,080
and a feel and a feel of a test if we

823
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,760
think we're ready

824
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,918
and then after that it's somebody else's

825
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,840
turn but we would like them to hang

826
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,760
around for that second year to mentor

827
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,320
the newcomers so they're not thrown in

828
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,039
at the deep end

829
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,520
we also have a wider community of people

830
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,158
interested or concerned about dr

831
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,760
now their level of commitment not may

832
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,240
not rise to stewardship

833
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,200
but if we create some sort of forum or

834
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,600
chat room or

835
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,440
you know internet space where people can

836
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,678
bring their concerns and ideas

837
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,200
then we can still crowdsource a lot of

838
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,880
this and this is where we're going to

839
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,279
recruit from in the future

840
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,200
so stay positive you know people will

841
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,840
find this

842
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,880
and the the sustainability means that

843
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,000
the program

844
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,919
should survive you uh and should survive

845
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,159
any of the stewards right so you really

846
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,320
need to be recruiting your successes

847
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,840
we ask every steward to recruit their

848
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:55,840
replacement

849
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:55,840
and those replacements are the par ones

850
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,960
so padawans need training and we do that

851
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,279
in three ways

852
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,159
you know i i learn from reading i learn

853
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,720
from seeing

854
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,520
and i learn from doing so we start off

855
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,440
with some

856
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,679
explainers and introductions to some

857
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,600
ideas and some definition of terms

858
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,760
right some book work some reading maybe

859
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,000
some quizzes some homework

860
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,600
um and and then i i learned from seeing

861
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,240
so they're going to attend a tabletop

862
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,760
exercise this will be the last tabletop

863
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,000
exercise organized by the stewards and

864
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,679
the padawans will will learn from this

865
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,880
they'll watch and they'll ask questions

866
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,799
and maybe they'll shadow

867
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,320
and they'll say okay i get it this is

868
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,679
this is what we're trying to achieve

869
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,158
okay and then they learn from doing

870
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,159
now the padawans themselves are going to

871
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,200
organize

872
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:51,360
tabletop exercises and tests

873
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,960
mentored by by last year's stewards

874
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,719
and that really is the sort of cycle of

875
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,000
life that is the pipelining of the

876
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,200
generations

877
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,600
padawan graduates to a steward um

878
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,279
stuart graduates to a mentor and a

879
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,840
mentor ages out

880
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,840
right

881
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,720
so how do we become a legit program i'm

882
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,640
not sure that there's any graduation

883
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,880
ceremony for doing that so i think you

884
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,159
just have to walk like a duck and quack

885
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,000
like a duck

886
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,240
and i realized that this slide feels

887
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,960
like playing defense

888
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,360
um so you can't do all of the things so

889
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,200
you

890
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,279
you know define what your scope is and

891
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,760
then make sure that your scope aligns

892
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,440
with the business's priorities and

893
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,440
that's always helpful

894
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,120
and come up with some kpis because if

895
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,480
you don't somebody else will voice them

896
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,799
upon you so they should be

897
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,559
realistic and achievable and you know

898
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,120
just just measure things

899
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,039
whatever you can measure really and have

900
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,559
a policy in a standard and and do that

901
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,158
before the policy writer

902
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,840
you know cuts and pays somebody else's

903
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,000
policy from elsewhere

904
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,918
so you just want to explain that you

905
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,679
know dr is happening and that you're

906
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,720
achieving all the criteria set out in

907
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,039
the standards

908
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,399
and then the standards will list all of

909
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,120
the goals and objectives

910
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,039
and the measurements um and the golden

911
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,678
rule of policies is that we say what we

912
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,679
do

913
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,760
and then we do what we say so bear that

914
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,440
in mind

915
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,519
and then connect with other programs

916
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,200
right so if if there's a risk register

917
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,880
in the risk management program

918
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,440
make sure you're registering items on

919
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,519
that if somebody is doing

920
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,960
in-house training modules make sure they

921
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,279
tend your padawan

922
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,039
training into a module i have this

923
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,640
business continuity

924
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,320
make sure you reach out and connect with

925
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,799
those folks and that you're

926
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,799
aligned

927
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,120
so what is next level for our dr program

928
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,799
honestly just hitting all of your

929
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,518
targets is an achievement enough

930
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,519
shifting left means getting earlier into

931
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,679
the process right so we want to be

932
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,279
into that design phase we want to be

933
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,399
into that requirements phase we want to

934
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,840
be into that planning

935
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:06,639
phase so that other people are

936
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,959
building in dr much earlier in what they

937
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
do

938
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,559
so that you don't have to try and bolt

939
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,240
it on to the end

940
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,559
i've had a lot of success with threat

941
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,679
modeling when we threat model some new

942
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,440
proposed product

943
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,799
i make sure that i insert something

944
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,480
about the dr

945
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,559
requirements right so tell me about your

946
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,000
vendors tell me if you're doing anything

947
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,639
that isn't our standard dr

948
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,840
practices explain it to me it's a great

949
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,840
way to pick up findings

950
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,640
being a differentiator when you have a

951
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,678
customer tell you that your dr program

952
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,720
is cut above

953
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,159
it's really validating more validating

954
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,159
than it should be

955
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,440
but it also gets the attention of the

956
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,840
business right

957
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,840
and you'll find that that success coming

958
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,799
from outside so from an auditor or a

959
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,199
customer

960
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,840
people will start to associate with that

961
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,120
success

962
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,720
and things get much much easier so

963
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,120
if that happens you will probably

964
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,760
attract some executive sponsor

965
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,959
who wants to further your success and

966
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,080
they're going to put backing and

967
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,199
resources behind

968
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,319
you now that is great because that means

969
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,480
you get to

970
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,879
to play at a more strategic level and

971
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,879
some of those big intractable problems

972
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,799
now you get to start tackling a couple

973
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,239
of those and it's a solid

974
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:35,839
solid improvement to your readiness

975
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:35,839
and you get to present at b-sides

976
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:46,240
so that's the end thank you everyone
