14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,760
both forgettable and unforgettable at

or b johnson obsidian security.com

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
so with that let's just dive in i wanted

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
to

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,119
i think present a bunch of information

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
today that's

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,720
both useful from a high level or more of

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,080
you know if you're kind of slightly more

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,759
in the business or totally more in the

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,759
business side of the house

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,759
or if you're very technical hardcore

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,080
security engineer hardcore

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,799
sock hardcore incident response i'm

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,798
hoping

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,240
there's material for everyone and that's

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,240
kind of the challenge with

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,439
keynotes right it's you kind of want to

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,000
present to everybody and

47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,720
and you know give some maybe interesting

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
thoughts and

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,759
and philosophies maybe some technical

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
information all

51
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,439
all blended so hopefully i can do that

52
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,880
for you today so really talking about

53
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,158
how you can think about your overall

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,520
environment how you can approach

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,960
security how you can just you know

56
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
hopefully get better

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
because let's let's face it we're not

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,680
we're not winning

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,600
as well as we should be in the cyber war

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,320
so with that um who am i

61
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,360
so uh co-founder cto of obsidian

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,439
security

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,439
uh so if any of you ever figure out what

64
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,399
a cto actually does for a living please

65
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,399
let me know

66
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,319
i feel like i put a new hat on every

67
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,280
hour of the day and it could be

68
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,160
deep dive into code with the engineers

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,160
it could be

70
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,440
talking to a reporter or gartner analyst

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,480
security

72
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,640
practitioner um

73
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,480
you know thinking about strategy road

74
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,440
maps all the other stuff right

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,760
uh so just a lot that goes on but uh the

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,840
the cool thing is i get to think about

77
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
security with all of that right we're

78
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,040
thinking about

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,119
sas security cloud security previously

80
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,799
i co-founded and with cto of carbon

81
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,720
black so i had the fortunate

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,720
opportunity there to see something go

83
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,680
from nothing to about 800 people when i

84
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,200
left

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,440
and i got to think about malware and

86
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,920
host-based recording you know endpoint

87
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,640
recording edr and that kind of thing

88
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,238
so really just how do we think about you

89
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,238
know detection response how do we think

90
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,920
about suspicious behavior from a device

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,680
or an endpoint perspective and now i get

92
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,440
to do it more from the user

93
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
or the you know kind of sas application

94
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,599
perspective with obsidian

95
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
and then prior to all that i started at

96
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,200
nsa

97
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,800
uh spent seven years from 2000 2007 in

98
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,920
the intelligence community

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,879
uh working with a bunch of different

100
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,518
agencies and uh defense department uh

101
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,200
components and different offices and

102
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,799
parts of the dod that kind of thing

103
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,399
it was awesome i would have done it for

104
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,000
free but they paid us

105
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,640
so i guess i won twice and uh it was

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,640
great

107
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,518
and uh and then i you know got got the

108
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,798
edge to do something more on the

109
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,000
commercial side which is where carbon

110
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,680
black spawned from

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,280
uh and now still doing it with obsidian

112
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,080
but i

113
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,799
missed the national security world so i

114
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,799
am fortunate that i got picked to be a

115
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,480
technical advisor to the u.s fisa court

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,640
so i get to work with

117
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,399
judges and legal advisors and and a

118
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,319
bunch of interesting people on very

119
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
interesting cases as a

120
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,560
you know kind of a technical uh

121
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
interpreter kind of thing i also love

122
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,760
startups so i'm involved with with

123
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,439
multiple startups probably way more than

124
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,079
this in terms of informal

125
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,079
uh discussions and anything i can do to

126
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,560
offer advice or opinions or

127
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,560
or whatever uh and you know fortunate in

128
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,399
my carbon black and obsidian roles i've

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,918
gotten to speak to hundreds and hundreds

130
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,399
and hundreds of

131
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,000
security teams could be best of the best

132
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,679
in maybe silicon valley

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,960
maybe columbus maybe new york city

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,560
you know different places that have

135
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,680
interesting teams interesting

136
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,440
environments

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,960
i've gotten to go all over the world i'd

138
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,960
leave my house for a couple weeks and go

139
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,440
all over asia trying to sell

140
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,159
you know product to uh i don't know

141
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,600
mssps or security teams in like thailand

142
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,199
or whatever it's kind of different than

143
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,960
uh doing it here right

144
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,240
uh but i get to learn a lot i get it to

145
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
absorb a lot so

146
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
having said all that there's gonna be a

147
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,440
lot of material in this

148
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,639
in this in this presentation so i hope

149
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,759
uh hope some of it resonates with you

150
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,600
and with that um what's the goal

151
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
you know i typically tend to have a

152
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,840
slide or maybe even this exact slide in

153
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,199
every presentation i do

154
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,039
and so today's goals it's really just

155
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,520
one goal which is i hope you spend

156
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,360
i hope you walk away with a feeling that

157
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,198
your time was well spent

158
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
but if we break it down a little bit i

159
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,240
want you to have some reflection i want

160
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,720
you to sit here and

161
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,280
and and get some forced reflection time

162
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,800
now

163
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,719
typically it's a little bit different

164
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,479
because you're in a

165
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
conference or at a summit or something

166
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,359
like that so it's like hey

167
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,120
shout out the email forget about all the

168
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,160
fires all the other stuff get some

169
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
reflection time

170
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,440
i know it's a little different you're

171
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
probably sitting at home but still can

172
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
you get some reflection forced

173
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,120
reflection

174
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,639
and then can you think can you ponder

175
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
can you contemplate hopefully some of

176
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,240
this stuff

177
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,599
leads to that and then finally what good

178
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,960
is any of that if you don't actually

179
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,720
like remember some stuff right so

180
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
hopefully you you walk away with some

181
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
things to remember

182
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,120
and again if you want to get these

183
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
slides or have follow-up conversations

184
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,639
would

185
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,520
love to have that so having said all

186
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,440
that

187
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,639
i haven't even started already like six

188
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,919
minutes in

189
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,280
um what are the challenges

190
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,960
now uh we have a lot we have a lot of

191
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,318
challenges and so we start on the inside

192
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,560
first sort of the internal

193
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,479
view your surface area what you're

194
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,080
defending is exploding

195
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,599
is expanding uh especially in 2020 right

196
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,880
i mean we're already on this

197
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
cloud migration journey as really a

198
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,479
globe

199
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,800
but you know most organizations and then

200
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,039
the

201
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
rapid acceleration and adoption of new

202
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,199
technology from the work from home

203
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,240
work from anywhere type policies and

204
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,160
realities

205
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
uh just means like your surface area

206
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
today looks quite different probably

207
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,479
than it did a year ago maybe not but

208
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,199
either way there's more stuff to defend

209
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,719
right uh and but we're good right like

210
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,840
we we should be good look at all this

211
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,840
stuff we're doing we're doing

212
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,880
architecture reviews we're writing rfps

213
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,318
we're going to meetings we're

214
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,680
troubleshooting we're doing help

215
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,199
desk we're doing hr work sometimes like

216
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,720
go get me all the events that this

217
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,240
person that's being terminated did

218
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,800
before they walked out the door

219
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,160
now i'm not saying any of that is bad

220
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,199
but what i'm saying is look at all the

221
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
stuff we're doing and

222
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,599
somewhere in the middle here is like

223
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,479
strategy or operations or that kind of

224
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,960
thing so

225
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,719
i know we have a lot on our plates as

226
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,120
security teams

227
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,199
and then if you go beyond that there's

228
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,479
some challenges some real challenges

229
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,560
and i've been reusing some of these

230
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,919
slides for years and i think it's

231
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,720
still relevant still accurate uh

232
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,440
because you know things just don't get

233
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,599
better that

234
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,639
fast and so first and foremost a skills

235
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,840
gap

236
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,080
whether it's a lack of

237
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,119
talent in the talent pool or maybe it's

238
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,758
poor

239
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,120
recruiting or misalignment between the

240
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,720
available skill sets and the

241
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,000
requirements right everyone likes to

242
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
joke that you need

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,199
you know 20 years kubernetes experience

244
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,039
or some of these other things that are

245
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,960
only a couple years old and yet you see

246
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,318
job descriptions saying you need

247
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,159
a lot of years of experience of

248
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
something that doesn't make sense

249
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,280
either way there's a gap like i see so

250
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,039
many teams that are

251
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,878
trying to hire trying to find people and

252
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,680
that kind of thing and then secondly

253
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,800
this notion of deploy and decay

254
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,720
so over time our environments are

255
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,199
tooling our detections are actually

256
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,639
getting worse rather than getting better

257
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,639
like sort of by default they're they're

258
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
moving into decay so we need to come in

259
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,319
and correct those

260
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,599
and then you have attacker successes so

261
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
whether it's someone getting into your

262
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,039
environment

263
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
ransomware just run-of-the-mill malware

264
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,240
maybe a more sophisticated

265
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,599
breach maybe you just see it on the news

266
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
it's tough because you just see

267
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
like there's a lot of people kind of

268
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,159
against you or you know

269
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,679
at least not with you and so that's not

270
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,919
necessarily

271
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,279
a pro it's more of a con here right it's

272
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,039
it's it's hard

273
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,800
and then there's a ton of data like you

274
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,040
click a button these days and it

275
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,719
transfers a terabyte of data from one

276
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,480
part of the country to another part of

277
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,800
the country or even out of the country

278
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
so there's a huge amount of data and

279
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,240
what i've seen

280
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
is this often adds up to a lack of cyber

281
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
self-esteem or

282
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,560
you know just sort of like hey man like

283
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,040
what can we do when the odds are kind of

284
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,680
stacked in our uh against us

285
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,680
and um you know we kind of need that

286
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,079
sesame street after school special to

287
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,880
say yes we can do it we can make

288
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,920
positive change or an impact on risk

289
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
reduction

290
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,959
or whatever you want to measure

291
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,959
yourselves by so

292
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,000
maybe that's what this talk is is the

293
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
after school special

294
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,360
but we have a lot of challenges right

295
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and then you start to think about things

296
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,720
like

297
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,279
like cloud and this migration to cloud

298
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
and

299
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,080
often i hear that you know executives or

300
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,200
the business side of the house

301
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,200
they don't realize that you all or we

302
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,920
all are still responsible for security

303
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
in the cloud

304
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,120
even if aws or microsoft or whomever is

305
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,680
responsible for security of the cloud

306
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,800
so just because you outsource maybe more

307
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,319
of the it

308
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,599
or compute side of the house doesn't

309
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,880
mean you're necessarily getting rid of

310
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
your security

311
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,360
obligations and then you multiply this

312
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,880
now that clouds talk to clouds you know

313
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
apps integrate with apps

314
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,560
and so you might lock down one drive and

315
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,000
yet someone integrates with slack and

316
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,479
slack isn't as locked down and now you

317
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,160
quite

318
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,079
you know you have quite of a vulnerable

319
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,839
situation or just an opportunity for

320
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,760
data leaks and such so

321
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,120
um things are moving fast business is

322
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,640
moving fast that's kind of the whole

323
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,320
point that's what you know we want to

324
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
enable innovation and that kind of thing

325
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
but

326
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,399
it doesn't necessarily make our lives

327
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,120
easier and then you know

328
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,880
when we think about what real teams are

329
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,399
actually saying and i'm guessing you all

330
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,480
have stories like this

331
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,560
um these are just quotes that i'm

332
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,079
hearing like i t is going from zero to

333
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,359
100 into the cloud and leaving us in the

334
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,399
dust or we're blind to these new

335
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
accounts or

336
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,160
50 of our engagements are you know now

337
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
cloud from a from an ir

338
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,760
firm um or you have a whole bunch of

339
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,480
accounts and no governance that kind of

340
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,319
thing so

341
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
there's just a lot going on and this is

342
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,600
all just internal i haven't even talked

343
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,240
about really the adversaries too much

344
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,920
yet

345
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,279
right so i get it and hopefully we all

346
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,240
are here together

347
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,240
to help discuss and share tips and

348
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,959
techniques and knowledge and

349
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,399
referrals and everything else because

350
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,399
there's a lot that the businesses are

351
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
doing that isn't necessarily making our

352
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,040
lives better

353
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,480
and that's part of the talk today is how

354
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,599
do we maybe kind of influence that a

355
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
little bit right

356
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,360
so what would a talk be without

357
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
you know maybe like a threat escape talk

358
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,800
right

359
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,160
um and someone somewhere is probably

360
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,640
drinking every time you show a slide

361
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,480
like this right i know those games

362
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,160
but if we think about it like breaches

363
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
are accelerating and you can see i

364
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,800
haven't even necessarily updated the

365
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,200
slide in a few years

366
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,719
because it doesn't really need to be

367
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800
updated there's just a lot

368
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,160
and we've kind of passed the point of no

369
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,160
return where there's enough

370
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,920
you know kind of adversarial success or

371
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,199
nation-state attacks or whatever we're

372
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,560
we're not really going back

373
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,680
like they're having enough success

374
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,599
making money or stealing ip or whatever

375
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,040
so this is reality like the internet is

376
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
now a war zone

377
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,560
so we have to think about that right and

378
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
if you even think about the headlines

379
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,839
from last year there's just there's a

380
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,480
lot right a lot of stuff

381
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,839
going on we probably have breach fatigue

382
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
headline fatigue

383
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,279
pick your kind of buzzword but we're

384
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
seeing a lot of stuff

385
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,399
and um you know it's sort of

386
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,000
desensitized to it

387
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,560
and you know recently there was the the

388
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,959
twitter breach and uh i think uh garmin

389
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,719
just paid what 10 million bucks for

390
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,239
uh ransomware because it basically

391
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
halted a lot of their operations and

392
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
such so

393
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,399
um this is literally just in the past

394
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,040
like month so there's there's

395
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,600
there's a lot uh and so when we think

396
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,160
about

397
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,000
who our adversaries are i wanted to put

398
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,079
a slide in like this because

399
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
i do think we need to think about who

400
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,839
we're up against

401
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
and what they're after what's their

402
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,279
motive right and

403
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,519
you can break this up in different ways

404
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,120
yourself or you know figure out how

405
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,720
how you want to best do like risk

406
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,079
modeling or threat modeling or these

407
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,519
other things but

408
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,040
first and foremost you have to worry

409
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,720
that there are people out there that

410
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,120
literally don't care who you are

411
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,240
they just want access to maybe your data

412
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
maybe your compute

413
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,000
maybe your identity to send out spam as

414
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,800
you or do business email compromise or

415
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,639
whatever

416
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,920
but they're just trying to make money

417
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,639
and money as you know

418
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,360
is quite a motivator especially when a

419
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,399
little bit of

420
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
cyber attack work maybe makes you more

421
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,040
money

422
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,040
from that attack than working a

423
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,240
legitimate job would in a year

424
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,079
something like that right especially

425
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,600
some of these other countries so

426
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,638
you have these opportunistic cyber

427
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,720
criminals and then you have you know

428
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,399
kind of opportunistic but a bit more

429
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,680
maybe targeted hacktivists who maybe

430
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,040
don't agree with you don't agree with

431
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,239
your positions your stances your

432
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
political donations

433
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
whatever it is you have to worry about

434
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,319
like people who aren't necessarily there

435
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
to steal

436
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,839
they're just there more to disrupt right

437
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,279
so you have to think a little bit more

438
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,000
about hey this isn't necessarily about

439
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,639
just

440
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,680
loss of information or data or

441
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,079
exploitation

442
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,880
of compute it might be actually you know

443
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,359
denial

444
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,560
of service or degradation of service of

445
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
whatever you're trying to do

446
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,079
right slow you down in terms of

447
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,279
productivity or the service you offer

448
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,040
and then you have the nation states

449
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,240
which quite frankly are doing everything

450
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,760
they're actually even making money

451
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,199
sometimes to try to you know fund

452
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,800
military and such

453
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,120
but um they're you know probably more

454
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,639
likely after ip or you know lists of

455
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,519
users maybe some of their

456
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,800
uh citizens are in your your database

457
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
for whatever reason and they're trying

458
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,639
to figure out some information

459
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,120
so you got to think about that and

460
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,040
finally

461
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,800
insiders and the reason i put this whole

462
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,399
slide together really

463
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:24,000
is because of insiders the

464
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,680
the first three criminals hacktivists

465
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,079
nation states what are they trying to

466
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,399
become they're trying to get

467
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,439
insider-like access or employee-like

468
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,839
access

469
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,839
so maybe you trust everyone maybe you

470
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,320
vet your employees very well and treat

471
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
them well

472
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,720
and and have very low uh you know risk

473
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,000
when it comes to a malicious like true

474
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,440
employee insider but what can their

475
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,240
credentials do

476
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,680
what can their access do if someone just

477
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,360
gets them with the phishing attack or

478
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,199
whatever but then uses that instead of

479
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,639
sending spam or whatever use that to

480
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,800
then pivot into other

481
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,120
you know credentials find some ssh keys

482
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
on their box log into the server

483
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
what can they do right so you have to

484
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,279
look at everyone in your environment not

485
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,519
necessarily as like

486
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
joe or bob or mary or whomever who's you

487
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,279
know maybe

488
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,800
amazing people but what can their access

489
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,160
what can their credentials do

490
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,839
and don't feel bad thinking that way

491
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,399
because it's truly like

492
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,760
disconnect the human from their access

493
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,800
you got to think about what the insider

494
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
access can do

495
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,439
but you also have to think about your

496
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,440
people and making sure you're not

497
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,760
creating a lot of insiders

498
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,800
as well and by the way insider attacks

499
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,880
do seem to be

500
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,439
a bit on the rise this year with lots of

501
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,040
layoffs and uncertainty and anxiety of

502
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
2020 and all the other stuff that's

503
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,599
going on in the

504
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,079
global climate so you know please be

505
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,440
careful there as well

506
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,040
so we just talked a lot about like the

507
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
human factor

508
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,240
but when we think about you know some of

509
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,000
these challenges

510
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,680
one of the things i like to call out is

511
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,040
that defenders are often defending

512
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,239
infrastructure but attackers are

513
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,439
attacking humans

514
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,160
like the attackers trying to get into

515
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,800
the ceo's laptop the cfo's you know

516
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
financial

517
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,240
spreadsheets or whatever but the

518
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
defender is thinking about ip addresses

519
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,920
and subnets and also other stuff

520
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,279
it's a little bit misaligned so i think

521
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,959
we just got to think about how do we

522
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,880
align a little bit better there

523
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,800
um and then there's you know mistakes

524
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,360
and we just talked a bit about insider

525
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,560
threat

526
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,480
and one thing i'll throw out there is a

527
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,479
lot of times like if you can just log in

528
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,480
rather than use some you know cyber

529
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
super weapon or zero day or

530
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,240
non-public exploit or whatever it is

531
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,160
you're going to try to go in the access

532
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,600
route because you're just logging in

533
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,439
you're not potentially throwing away

534
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,399
this you know 10 million dollar tool or

535
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,040
whatever

536
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,000
so um you know think about like access

537
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,199
and and

538
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,120
logins and then you know think maybe

539
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,599
about zero days and stuff because

540
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
why do this crazy operation if you just

541
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,639
walk through the front door

542
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
or try password one two three or

543
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,800
whatever right so we gotta think about

544
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,120
that

545
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,639
the other thing and then i promise i'll

546
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,720
actually get to more of the meat

547
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,079
this is just setting us up so hopefully

548
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,600
you're still with me

549
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,239
uh i saw this in a ted talk

550
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,240
about health actually but i thought this

551
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,640
applies so well to security

552
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,559
the absence of and i.t the absence of

553
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,400
disease does not mean health

554
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,639
like talk to your team talk to your

555
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,640
board talk to your executives whomever

556
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,640
you know business leaders just because

557
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,079
you're not in the front page of the news

558
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,559
does not mean you're healthy does not

559
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,079
mean you have good information security

560
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,760
so you have to think about like that

561
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,799
step back like are you doing the

562
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,439
equivalent of

563
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,720
you know healthy eating and exercise and

564
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,600
you know getting your checkups and all

565
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,080
the other stuff

566
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,879
because if you're not you know that

567
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,120
there's

568
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,120
stuff brewing down there there's tech

569
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,479
dead there's risk there's holes that are

570
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,239
not being patched

571
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,840
so just think about like the absence of

572
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,200
disease does not mean health right and

573
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,439
maybe you can pass that along to your

574
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,440
team

575
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,240
so

576
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,120
approaching security how do we you know

577
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,960
start to take

578
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,719
all of this stuff that we need to kind

579
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,200
of combat we've mostly just talked about

580
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,240
things we need to combat how do we go

581
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,200
about like

582
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,080
even trying to tackle this stuff right

583
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,840
well

584
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
first and foremost i'm telling you we

585
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,080
can do better maybe again maybe i'm

586
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,840
on the sesame street special but we can

587
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
do better in some ways we are doing

588
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,240
better

589
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,840
like things have gotten better but the

590
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,240
adversaries have also advanced too

591
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
right so um we're not done it's not

592
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,200
enough in some ways it could get worse

593
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,959
this explosion of

594
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,520
devices explosion of data right

595
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,000
talking about all the sort of vaccine

596
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,600
research and everything and clouds and

597
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,679
people trying to hack each other and

598
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,480
take out hospitals and stuff like

599
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,559
so this is not going away you all are

600
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,440
gonna have jobs

601
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,639
and um we need to do the best we can and

602
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,840
we need to raise the bar

603
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,320
right and we can we can do it

604
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,760
and of all the teams i've talked to this

605
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
might even be a higher number now like

606
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,240
800

607
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,000
companies um all over the world

608
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,919
i try to boil it down and maybe you all

609
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
have a better way of

610
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,840
describing the difference but to me it's

611
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,559
it's kind of a simple

612
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,360
difference between do you try to hire a

613
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,480
team

614
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,520
do you try to build a team that is

615
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,320
more i'm going to plug you in with a

616
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,480
tool

617
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,360
and you're going to look at reports and

618
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
alerts

619
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
and be like an analyst in the sort of

620
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,400
pure sense of the word

621
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,639
or am i going to take my resources take

622
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,960
my technology take my data feeds

623
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,039
and step back almost like a like a

624
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,559
excuse me a product manager or service

625
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,120
provider and say how am i going to

626
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,120
build how am i going to engineer the

627
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,678
optimum way

628
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,678
to reduce risk to especially information

629
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,720
security risk in my environment

630
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,080
and the teams i see that are better and

631
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,400
quite frankly a lot of times

632
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,159
um it's you know it starts with just

633
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
having like software engineering skills

634
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,000
on the team but the teams that i've seen

635
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,600
do better and it's not it's not a

636
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,039
zero or one proposition there's there's

637
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,959
good teams on both but

638
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,039
in general if i walk into an environment

639
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,480
and and the mindset is much more of like

640
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,000
how can we build and take the output of

641
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,880
this and shove it into this and enrich

642
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
it with this and

643
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,679
you know tie in this threat feed and

644
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,640
this open source intelligence and all

645
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,720
this other stuff

646
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
that's a better team just just you know

647
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,320
in general so

648
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,520
if you're not doing that that's okay but

649
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
like maybe you can do more of that and

650
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,158
if you are doing that

651
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,520
again how can you maybe do do more of

652
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,240
that like how can you stitch together

653
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,600
and have that engineering mindset

654
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,600
now speaking of mindset

655
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,199
i want us to shift our mindset i want

656
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,480
you to shift your mindset if it's not

657
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,679
already shifted

658
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,720
now what often happens in security right

659
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,400
is we're supposed to be

660
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,000
i don't know maybe the offensive line in

661
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,520
football and the ball

662
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
is hiked and we drop back and we're just

663
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,600
trying to take what's coming at us right

664
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,159
we

665
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
you know maybe maybe in the uh actually

666
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,120
corporate world we're a little bit more

667
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,120
passive we just have to

668
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,120
react to whatever the business deploys

669
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,039
or it deploys we think about the

670
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
environment as if we only have read-only

671
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,440
access

672
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,158
and events sort of happen to us right

673
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,480
that's what i see a lot but can we shift

674
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,360
it can we be more aggressive

675
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,159
like the defensive line right and we go

676
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,000
after

677
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,200
what we want to go after and you think

678
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,039
about the corporate environment it's

679
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,159
like can we think we actually have a say

680
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,158
here we actually have

681
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,760
like a seat at the table to sort of mold

682
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,159
or give our opinion and sort of have

683
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,879
right access to what's going on can we

684
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,400
help shape the environment

685
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
that's what we need to do and that's

686
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,360
really what this talk is about is how we

687
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,720
think about what can we do

688
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,959
in the environment to have an impact and

689
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,480
you know i'm a huge book nerd and my

690
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,280
favorite book

691
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,559
is essentialism and i'll put an actual

692
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
slide at the end for some book

693
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,440
recommendations but

694
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,959
it's essentialism it's about making the

695
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,039
wisest possible

696
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,159
investment of your time and energy in

697
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,120
order to have the highest point of

698
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,120
contribution

699
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,439
basically how do you focus on the vital

700
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,120
few versus the trivial

701
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,760
many often in security we focus on the

702
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,959
trivial

703
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,559
many oh i'm just going to get through as

704
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,600
many alerts as i can it's like did that

705
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,918
really make an impact

706
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,918
or can you like tune it a little or you

707
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,000
know create something more upstream so

708
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,520
you don't need all these alerts

709
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,440
and that one thing would have much more

710
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,120
impact than just resolving you know 20

711
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,400
or 50 or 100 alerts

712
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,120
so anyways where's the best roi of our

713
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
time

714
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,639
i want you to think about that as we

715
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,240
keep going right and again i'm throwing

716
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,880
a lot at you there's gonna be a lot more

717
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,720
stuff

718
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,280
i hope just some of it sticks

719
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,039
contemplation forced reflection

720
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,399
right and you can uh come back and and

721
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,679
hopefully review if there's anything of

722
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,720
interest here

723
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,039
so what we did as a

724
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,760
cyber security or information security

725
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,559
culture or

726
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,320
you know community is we said we need to

727
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,918
slow attackers down

728
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,600
so for the longest time we focus on

729
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,120
blocking or unlocking down

730
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,879
what you know what what could be done

731
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,399
what what's capable of being done

732
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,480
against these systems

733
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,640
and that's great we need to keep doing

734
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,080
that so like what can i block what can i

735
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,840
prevent

736
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,280
you need to have that right you don't

737
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,520
want to just say

738
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,280
everyone come on in you need to have

739
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,879
some blocking some locking down

740
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,039
et cetera you need to slow attackers

741
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,280
down but

742
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,520
we all know or we should know if we

743
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,678
don't blocking is not enough

744
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,960
and so really over the last 10 years

745
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,400
there's been more

746
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,080
investment more resources shifted to

747
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,240
detection and response because you

748
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,280
cannot stop 100

749
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,799
of attacks and threats right and so we

750
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,960
said you know what

751
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,559
something somewhere or the insider or

752
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,720
whatever is going to get through

753
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,559
so we must find things quicker react

754
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,520
clean up remediate et cetera

755
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,559
faster more efficiently more effectively

756
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,080
so we said that

757
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,080
right and so then we did things like

758
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,760
orchestration which grew into this whole

759
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,918
market of like soar and

760
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,120
automation but instead of just an alert

761
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,120
going to a human

762
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,719
you you know so some of these teams and

763
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,199
some of these some of this grew out of

764
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,799
uh corporate security teams that had

765
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,640
software engineers they built

766
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,320
tools like fido and netflix and some of

767
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,480
these others where

768
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,600
you get an alert and you say okay what

769
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,679
device is this

770
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,439
is this the cfo or the intern do i have

771
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,960
any reputational information from my

772
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,679
threat feeds

773
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,360
then all of that data automatically

774
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,120
pulled together and correlated

775
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,000
goes to a human right then the human has

776
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,840
a much better

777
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
opportunity to make a decision use

778
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,879
critical thought rationale etc

779
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,200
and then if they want to take

780
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,760
remediation action you have technology

781
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,320
that can block kill preserve evidence

782
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,000
you know

783
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,678
reset credentials etc but you figure out

784
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,120
where it's best for a machine to do it

785
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,880
where's best for a human to do it and i

786
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,239
think that was really good a really

787
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,200
you know step forward for cyber security

788
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,919
and then also that's not enough to be

789
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
complete

790
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,279
so then this whole notion of like sort

791
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,439
of threat hunting evolved which is

792
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
look regardless of all of my detection

793
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
capabilities

794
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,720
i'm not going to detect 100 of the

795
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,799
unwanted actions in my environment

796
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,760
could be a mistake it could be malicious

797
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,440
activity but

798
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,279
somewhere there's going to be something

799
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,159
that all of my detection rules and

800
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,039
tooling

801
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,039
do not detect so that gap between that

802
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,200
and the entire you know totality of

803
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,120
threats and unwanted behavior

804
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,640
is the gap that hunting fills putting a

805
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,479
human mind going having

806
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,240
you know a thesis or a hypothesis going

807
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,520
after and seeing like is that correct is

808
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,679
there anything

809
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,799
unexpected or interesting and then if so

810
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,559
is it an actual

811
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,240
you know compromise or threat and then

812
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,039
tuning detections hopefully get better

813
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,279
and better better

814
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,480
but threat hunting really evolved so we

815
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,320
did all this stuff

816
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,760
really because what we're trying to do

817
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,720
we're trying to speed

818
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,640
defenders up right so we've done a bunch

819
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,679
of stuff beyond blocking

820
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,640
so are we good right we're good

821
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,799
because we did all that no we still have

822
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,120
employees contractors guests

823
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,400
executives like it's not just about the

824
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,360
external attacker it's also about the

825
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,559
insider threat

826
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,959
internal actor etc right and

827
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,840
mistakes and and all that fun stuff that

828
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,919
we all live with

829
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,520
probably every day so

830
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,000
what else did we start doing we started

831
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,799
discouraging bad behavior now this isn't

832
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,840
all

833
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,240
uh you know exclusive to either speeding

834
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,158
up

835
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,080
defenders or slowing down attackers or

836
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,400
whatever or discouraging bad behavior

837
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
but

838
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,080
you know in this case it's it's it's

839
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,439
it's less focused on the adversary and

840
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,799
less focused on our

841
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,559
information security team it's more

842
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,520
focused on the entire sort of user

843
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,360
population

844
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,200
you start saying hey don't click be

845
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,918
paranoid don't circumvent us don't

846
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
install that

847
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,039
so start forcing training we start

848
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,880
preaching

849
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,960
we all know how well that goes right

850
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
that's the stick not the carrot

851
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
uh sometimes it's necessary sometimes

852
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,520
it's absolutely effective but a lot of

853
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,840
times it's

854
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,080
not enough and not necessarily sort of

855
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,520
acceptable with some of the cultures of

856
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,559
the the corporate environment and stuff

857
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,080
like that where

858
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,678
you know you don't want to be the person

859
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,360
always saying no

860
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,080
uh and so what we've seen now

861
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,360
is this shift of csos and security

862
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,360
leaders security

863
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,840
uh engineers etc to be more

864
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,840
collaborative more constructive like

865
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,120
go to the business unit and say hey you

866
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,240
know what i'm still accountable for

867
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
security i know you're installing this

868
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,840
marketing thing

869
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,439
but like i'm accountable so like we need

870
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,158
to work together and so no

871
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,480
has become yes but like yes you can do

872
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,559
this

873
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,000
but here's the review i need to conduct

874
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,200
or here's the controls i need or the

875
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,400
data i need the

876
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,080
the logs etc and what what

877
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,520
seems to be the case out there i've seen

878
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,279
this and i've heard other csos talk

879
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,520
about this and such

880
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,640
is that you have to appeal to the heart

881
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,000
like you have to make it more of an

882
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,720
emotional thing so

883
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,760
yeah if someone clicks that dumb

884
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,360
phishing link

885
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,200
often it's not that they didn't know to

886
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,799
click it it's that they had apathy they

887
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,159
didn't care they're like yeah i'm tired

888
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,279
whatever i'm going home soon i'll just

889
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,880
click this thing because

890
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,240
it might be something even though in

891
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
their their mind it's kind of telling

892
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,360
them like

893
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
this is not right but they have apathy

894
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,399
so if you can appeal to the heart and

895
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,799
get them to care more about like

896
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,799
why this is making your co-workers safer

897
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,879
and better and the company more

898
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,240
resilient that's when you get some

899
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,600
change right

900
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,559
and so what we're really talking about

901
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,480
is encouraging good decisions

902
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,480
you need to get upstream get earlier

903
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,000
into the process improve the sdlc the

904
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,760
software life cycle procurement et

905
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,200
cetera so you need to be a partner

906
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,600
with the rest of your business so you

907
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,120
enable security risk assessments early

908
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,639
you know things are easier and cheaper

909
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,158
to correct before deployment

910
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,600
i'm probably preaching to the choir here

911
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,799
in a lot of this but i want to call it

912
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,799
out like we need to be thinking about

913
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,520
this stuff and so if you start to put

914
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,360
these pieces together

915
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,440
what we're really saying is first you

916
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,879
want to slow attackers down

917
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,200
because if you don't do that like it's

918
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,799
going to be chaos then you want to speed

919
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,799
defenders up

920
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,480
make sure your you and your team can do

921
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,279
the most with the limited amount of time

922
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,120
you have

923
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,399
but then it's really a

924
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,158
it's a it's it's like you need the

925
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,959
national guard you need your your

926
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,799
company

927
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,039
helping and how they do that is through

928
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,200
the discouragement of bad behaviors and

929
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,720
the encouragement of good behavior or

930
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,720
good decisions

931
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,080
right and so if you flip this around a

932
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,679
little bit

933
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,439
it's really slow attackers down

934
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,960
speed defenders up and in the middle is

935
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,320
your user population

936
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,880
it's really about how can they think

937
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,600
about security

938
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,919
as like a default piece of the puzzle

939
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,719
like

940
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,399
how do i have configurations and

941
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,240
deployments and that kind of thing

942
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,600
be more secure by default that's really

943
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
what i mean here

944
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,879
and hopefully you can use something like

945
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,240
this because

946
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,240
it's quite easy to explain to the

947
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,039
business it's like hey yeah we're doing

948
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
this because it's going to slow

949
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,360
attackers down

950
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,440
or we're doing this because it's going

951
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,879
to speed defenders up or we're doing

952
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,080
this because by default

953
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,520
we want a more secure deployment or more

954
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,360
resilient configuration or access that

955
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,320
goes away faster so that you don't leak

956
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,240
stuff

957
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,600
it's just it's it's it's a good way to

958
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,679
think about things and i think it puts

959
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,439
it in a quite simple way of thinking

960
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:50,880
about things

961
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,880
so um thinking about this framework now

962
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,399
hope you're still with me uh i'm on the

963
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,679
west coast so

964
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,799
started at six a.m uh but uh how do we

965
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,000
how do we think about this well

966
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,279
first of all you've got to be able to

967
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,640
communicate all this which is kind of

968
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,559
the slide i was just talking about like

969
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,840
how do you communicate what you're doing

970
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,520
where you're investing how you're

971
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,080
reducing risk how you're enabling the

972
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,840
business

973
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,439
while still keeping it more safe or

974
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,199
safer um

975
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,360
and and that kind of thing right so you

976
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,480
got to think about communication and

977
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,678
sort of teamwork but then if we move on

978
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,640
to some of those things we just talked

979
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,679
about

980
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,679
slowing attackers down so

981
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,360
i think slowing attackers down is is

982
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,360
often

983
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,639
quite easy to wrap your head around if

984
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,000
you step back and think about it right

985
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,120
and again some of these are quite

986
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,679
simplistic but

987
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,158
you know single sign-on can you force

988
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,679
all the logins all the authentications

989
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,360
through a choke point like through a

990
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,240
single point

991
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,678
because then you have a much better

992
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,000
place

993
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,039
to monitor to make sure it's configured

994
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,039
properly

995
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,799
to see who's logging in right look for

996
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,600
anomalies and things like that

997
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,080
so single sign-on the more single

998
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,039
sign-on we see in our our world

999
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,879
uh you know me from obsidian the usually

1000
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,919
the fewer uh

1001
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,840
compromises we see then if

1002
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,679
you've forced everyone through a single

1003
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,240
sign-on point

1004
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,679
multi-factor authentication it's much

1005
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,279
more obtainable

1006
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,519
because you're just basically turning it

1007
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,159
on for one account

1008
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,200
the single sign-on account and then you

1009
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,960
need to disable

1010
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,559
legacy authentication or weak

1011
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,000
authentication because some of these

1012
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,080
systems do allow

1013
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,039
for methods to get into mailboxes or

1014
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,519
other things

1015
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,640
that bypass the need for something like

1016
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,399
mfa

1017
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,000
or or you know single sign-on as well

1018
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,120
like make sure there's not some backdoor

1019
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,720
accounts into these

1020
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,320
these systems and then think about

1021
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,000
things like anti-phishing or some of the

1022
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,960
common attack vectors

1023
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,480
the more you can do there then you're

1024
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,279
slowing attackers down making it harder

1025
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,120
raising the bar

1026
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,279
right so create fewer entry points make

1027
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,799
it harder to compromise

1028
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,799
and then really it's about like limiting

1029
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,440
attack other attack vectors

1030
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,320
and reducing the blast radius right like

1031
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,200
what what could be

1032
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,519
uh used once someone's in and so you

1033
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,039
know

1034
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,799
oauth applications scrutiny or sort of

1035
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,960
third-party applications we see that a

1036
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,120
lot too it's actually becoming quite a

1037
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,159
hot attack vector because

1038
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,399
people have gotten better at

1039
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,080
multi-factor authentication but if i

1040
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,678
just send you a link and say hey

1041
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,279
you've been invited to join the brand

1042
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,000
new like google drive

1043
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,519
app um click here you click there it

1044
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,039
says hey do you authorize this to have

1045
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,399
basically full access to google drive

1046
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,080
you say yep

1047
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,399
you should probably ask yourself why you

1048
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,918
need to authorize that if it's already

1049
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,239
in google but whatever maybe that

1050
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,240
happens and

1051
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,440
then they're in they don't need to log

1052
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,120
in as you ever

1053
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,200
they don't need to get your mfa they

1054
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,719
have the token token has

1055
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,640
you know whatever scopes you granted to

1056
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,240
it and they can pull data

1057
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,760
read documents from your entire domain

1058
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,279
or whatever so

1059
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,559
um you got to think about that and

1060
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,000
things like powershell can you just

1061
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,440
disable powershell i've been saying this

1062
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,640
for like six years

1063
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,360
um disable it or just say hey look on

1064
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,080
uh sunday night between 11 pm and 12

1065
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,678
midnight

1066
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,678
it's the only time powershell will run

1067
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,279
all of our it jobs will run it then

1068
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,799
and then it'll shut it off across the

1069
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,240
fleet the rest

1070
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,600
of the six days and 23 hours

1071
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,840
can you just do something like that i

1072
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,480
know it's easier said than done

1073
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,760
but hopefully you're you're thinking

1074
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,159
hopefully there's thoughts going right

1075
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,519
like

1076
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,679
maybe yeah maybe i could at least reduce

1077
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,360
it to one day a week or something

1078
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,080
same with like local admin and stuff

1079
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,360
like that or can you do allow list where

1080
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,039
only certain things are allowed to run

1081
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,199
right i mean ipad is kind of the classic

1082
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,360
example of an iphone

1083
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,640
basically yeah it's not perfect but it's

1084
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,719
pretty hard to get

1085
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,919
malware into the apple store and then

1086
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,519
that's really the only thing that can

1087
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,399
deliver software so you basically have a

1088
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,640
trusted

1089
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,518
software repository so it's quite hard

1090
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,440
to get uh

1091
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,279
malware onto you know an iphone or an

1092
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,760
ipad that kind of thing

1093
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,279
so how do you slow attackers down i want

1094
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,158
you to think about that how am i slowing

1095
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,159
attackers down now

1096
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,360
so now slowing attackers down now let's

1097
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,399
think about

1098
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,000
speeding defenders up really starts with

1099
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,678
visibility right because

1100
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,519
by speeding defenders up what we really

1101
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,440
mean is they need access to information

1102
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,159
to be able to investigate to be able to

1103
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,480
triage

1104
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,760
hunt you know that kind of thing and so

1105
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,159
you know i think what you've seen is the

1106
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,560
entire industry shifted away from this

1107
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,639
sort of method of scanning and sweeps

1108
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,279
and looking for iocs or binaries or

1109
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,800
whatever

1110
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,639
to continuous recording whether it's

1111
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,320
endpoint cloud network

1112
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,639
other places in the environment you know

1113
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,079
continuous recording has been quite uh

1114
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,839
become quite common and sort of

1115
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,919
ubiquitous here um

1116
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,918
but then can you take it steps further

1117
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,839
so can you add thread intelligence or

1118
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,440
reputation information so you know like

1119
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,839
yeah i have a whole bunch of

1120
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,879
uh you know data points or information

1121
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,040
but i know some are

1122
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,719
kind of marked as known bad maybe i

1123
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,719
start there and some are known as

1124
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,078
marked as known good maybe i can ignore

1125
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,439
that for a bit maybe ever

1126
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,359
and then focus on the middle once i'm

1127
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,960
once i'm done with those um

1128
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,799
and then you know maybe prevalence or

1129
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,200
frequency like hey if something's

1130
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,640
kind of known bad but happens all over

1131
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,799
the time all the time

1132
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,240
maybe i'm really screwed or i have bad

1133
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,680
thread intel but either way i have more

1134
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,399
information i can make better better

1135
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,078
decisions

1136
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,560
and then finally relationships really

1137
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,040
help help drive this to a better place

1138
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,078
where

1139
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,640
you know is this the ceo or the intern

1140
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,079
that ran svc host late at night on

1141
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,118
christmas

1142
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,200
you know in a strange user context maybe

1143
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,440
i'm jumping out of bed for the ceo

1144
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,879
maybe not for the intern maybe still but

1145
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,560
i have more information

1146
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,920
is this just powershell running from a

1147
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,440
script or is this powershell running

1148
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,040
that was spawned from word

1149
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,960
spawned from outlook pretty pretty

1150
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,320
common attack vector right

1151
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,760
so if you start having these

1152
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,839
relationships and such that's where you

1153
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,680
really start to to get power

1154
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,078
and start to understand what's you know

1155
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,680
kind of what's normal and what's not um

1156
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,200
and you know one thing that that kind of

1157
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,919
works against us though

1158
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,359
is this is our it environment so is your

1159
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,800
it environment is your

1160
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,960
you know kind of just just overall

1161
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,000
corporate environment more like the left

1162
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,240
or the right is are people using gold

1163
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,200
images you know re-imaging and

1164
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,839
installing clean

1165
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,560
you know clean boxes have good hygiene

1166
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,400
can people

1167
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,000
everyone use like spotify and any other

1168
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,920
app they want and it clogs up all your

1169
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,720
logs all these random processes that are

1170
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,480
not really

1171
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,160
trusted or allowed but it's not really

1172
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,119
frowned upon in your policy or your

1173
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,118
culture

1174
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,040
um you know and i've sat in the the

1175
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,280
traffic on the left on some of my trips

1176
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,960
and i don't i don't know who's sort of

1177
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,960
breaking the law or who's

1178
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,320
sort of got right away or whatever on

1179
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,480
the right though it's quite easy

1180
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,920
you know in the in a figurative sense if

1181
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,280
you see a strange truck

1182
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,880
or a person or someone going

1183
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,320
perpendicular you know in your

1184
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,839
environment when everything's going a

1185
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,079
certain way

1186
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,440
it's much easier to spot either from a

1187
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,960
human or you know technology and

1188
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,800
detection rules

1189
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,079
so we've got to think about that and

1190
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,880
another thing i want to bring up

1191
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,920
is and i'm a multi-time vendor so i can

1192
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,480
say this

1193
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,680
push on your vendors ask for features

1194
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,079
ask for integrations

1195
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,200
ask for training you know it doesn't

1196
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,240
mean they're gonna give you everything

1197
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,319
you ask for

1198
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,439
but like push on them you know just one

1199
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,119
simple thing is like

1200
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,040
you bought a product a year ago it's

1201
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,079
coming up on renewal

1202
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,040
has it advanced in that year if it

1203
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,640
hasn't

1204
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,320
now maybe there's reasons why you need

1205
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,078
to keep it or whatever but if it hasn't

1206
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,000
ask your vendor why not

1207
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,839
what are they investing in that how is

1208
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,880
it getting better is it shifting

1209
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,320
your needs are shifting the

1210
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,599
environment's shifting the adversaries

1211
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,599
are you know advancing

1212
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,200
your defenses need to be advancing too

1213
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,800
so push on your vendors

1214
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,040
ask for more and tell them i told you to

1215
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,200
do that and they can yell at me

1216
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,040
to do it so thinking about this

1217
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,480
i just talked about a bunch of stuff

1218
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,800
we're talking about speeding defenders

1219
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
up

1220
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,160
so really what we're talking about is

1221
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,079
like you need to give your defenders

1222
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,279
telemetry you know visibility into

1223
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,280
you know what's going on in different

1224
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,119
parts of the tech stack the environment

1225
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,200
they need access i've talked to security

1226
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,599
teams where they have to put in a

1227
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,640
help desk ticket to get access to o365

1228
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,720
logs

1229
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,560
during an ir and sometimes it takes a

1230
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,118
week for it to give them the locks

1231
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,480
this is during an incident response it's

1232
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,200
like mind blowing

1233
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,320
but it's reality so can you make sure

1234
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,680
you have the right access

1235
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,760
ahead of time so when you're

1236
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,279
investigating triaging correlating

1237
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,599
doing a full-blown you know evidence

1238
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,960
collection and forensics situation

1239
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,320
you have the access you need or at least

1240
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,520
you've built those relationships and

1241
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,839
you've communicated

1242
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,839
why you need access or hey i might come

1243
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,320
to you someday and need this so

1244
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,560
please quickly grant it to me you know

1245
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,920
leverage the hell out of your tools

1246
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,000
you know push on your vendors talked

1247
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,920
about that like we all have tools

1248
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,240
you're not using your tools completely i

1249
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,599
guarantee it there's more value in your

1250
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,118
tools than you are using

1251
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,200
today get more value out of them

1252
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,480
push on your vendors and then write code

1253
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,000
write code write code

1254
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,640
pretty much every product out there now

1255
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,240
has apis or ways you can like stitch

1256
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,359
together information pull information

1257
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,279
out shove it into

1258
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,880
you know just throw up an elastic search

1259
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,599
instance if you need to or whatever

1260
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,079
but like do some engineering work and

1261
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,599
then do

1262
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,839
retrospectives and things like that

1263
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,400
where you know you're sharing lessons

1264
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,440
that you learn this week maybe across

1265
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,680
companies

1266
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,760
like it it doesn't have to be internally

1267
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,359
like tell another team how you operate

1268
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,320
it's not just about like ip addresses

1269
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,319
and iocs

1270
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,079
when we talk about sharing it's about

1271
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,520
like best practices or i hired someone

1272
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,839
really great this is how i did it

1273
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,079
or i constructed a really great security

1274
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,839
program that actually enabled my entire

1275
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,440
company to become my national guard

1276
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,440
share that give a talk at something like

1277
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,280
this talk to each other whatever

1278
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,800
but share that stuff and then can you

1279
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,200
tune you know that constant

1280
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,400
deploy and decay we got to fight it so

1281
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,598
are you tuning things

1282
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,359
right so i'm preaching a bit here but

1283
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,800
have you added like an updated rule or

1284
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,560
tuned something this week

1285
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,480
got to do it okay now the other

1286
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,040
piece i want to talk about which is like

1287
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,280
the default security

1288
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,560
can you enlist other people in your

1289
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,320
organization

1290
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,720
to attend security boot camps and make

1291
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,800
it a perk it's a perfect way

1292
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,959
to offer like a perk i'm going to teach

1293
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,920
you how to secure your home router and

1294
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,440
your kids

1295
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,160
gmail address and make sure when they

1296
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,280
play um you know minecraft online or

1297
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,720
whatever they're not going to bad

1298
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,040
youtube sites or whatever

1299
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,959
right we're not talking earth shattering

1300
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,839
education here but we're talking good

1301
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,520
concepts that help reinforce corporate

1302
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,160
security concepts that you want them to

1303
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,319
learn

1304
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,839
so can you do stuff like that and of

1305
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,000
course teach them about internal

1306
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,759
you know internal things targeting what

1307
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,920
might be going on with your environment

1308
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,520
that kind of thing but get them involved

1309
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,000
and you know i was talking to

1310
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,440
a really awesome team uh in one of the

1311
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
best uh

1312
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,359
most well-known brands in the world and

1313
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,119
they said the best thing they've done is

1314
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,440
they roll in devops

1315
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,880
person and then basically they're a

1316
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,240
full-time security person for

1317
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,440
could be a couple weeks could be even a

1318
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
couple months and then they roll them

1319
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,960
back

1320
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,400
now they have a much better

1321
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,079
understanding of how security works how

1322
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,560
to how to better deploy their own stuff

1323
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,160
in

1324
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,599
a secure way or a way that helps speed

1325
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,560
up defenders or against slow down

1326
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,160
attackers

1327
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,200
um and they're you know just more of an

1328
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,040
ambassador you've built those

1329
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,040
relationships that kind of thing so

1330
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,119
can you do stuff like that where you

1331
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,119
roll in an engineer or someone from

1332
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,800
you know kind of the other side of it

1333
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,520
into security for a bit and then roll

1334
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,040
them back out

1335
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,560
right immersion that's going to be a

1336
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,599
great way to do it

1337
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,440
another thing is access how often do we

1338
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,240
give someone access

1339
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,599
and then that's it i gave you access and

1340
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,078
by default

1341
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,040
access never goes away so this is what

1342
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,480
i'm talking about when i talk about

1343
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,920
drive default security

1344
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,040
can you flip it so by default

1345
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,240
if you do nothing else eventually access

1346
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,480
goes away it like it itself has a dk

1347
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,720
right it itself has a half-life

1348
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,720
and it starts to go away right because

1349
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,720
what we typically set ourselves up for

1350
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,319
is we have to go out of our way to be

1351
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,240
better at security rather than having

1352
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,480
the default path forward

1353
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,319
just make us more secure right so can

1354
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,440
you counter this like identity creep or

1355
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,040
you know everyone's having too much

1356
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,960
access too much surface area

1357
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,119
they don't really need so can access

1358
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,720
have a half-life you see stuff like uh

1359
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,720
like slack is pretty good when you add a

1360
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,560
guest you can right away add a

1361
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,759
uh end date and then you can extend it

1362
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,599
but that means i had to go out of my way

1363
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,000
to explicitly extend their access

1364
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,839
otherwise

1365
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,599
if i do nothing if i go on vacation for

1366
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,279
three months their access goes away i'm

1367
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,160
in a more secure place at least you know

1368
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,520
in theory

1369
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,480
so thinking about that and then you know

1370
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,640
when you think about

1371
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,880
like other aspects of security in the

1372
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,520
business you know can you establish

1373
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,359
sort of pre-procurement review i know

1374
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,240
people sign up for sas quite quickly and

1375
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,160
quite often

1376
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,160
can you establish a pre-procurement

1377
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,960
review can you create an

1378
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,920
access review process can you have

1379
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,520
sponsorship

1380
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,720
internally for guests and contractors

1381
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,759
right like how many times have you

1382
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,279
looked at an account

1383
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,599
especially if it's like a contractor or

1384
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,560
guest and you have no idea who the

1385
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,400
internal

1386
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,920
you know employee your company was that

1387
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,119
asked for them to join

1388
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,040
yeah maybe there's a ticket in some

1389
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,640
other system somewhere or whatever but

1390
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,759
like it's hard to track that down or

1391
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,319
keep track of it

1392
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,599
right can you do that and then you know

1393
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,960
things like single sign-on that we

1394
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,319
already talked about but like

1395
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,640
can each new system just interact or

1396
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,040
just

1397
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,560
uh integrate with your single sign-on

1398
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,680
system so by default you know okay at

1399
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,119
least i'm going to see people like

1400
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,359
logging in because i'm looking at octa

1401
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,680
or

1402
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,279
you know microsoft or whatever so i can

1403
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,720
see this new tool and let's see who's

1404
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,720
logging in who's using it

1405
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,078
and then things like we all share files

1406
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,879
all over the time all the time

1407
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,520
right all over the place do they have a

1408
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,119
password

1409
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,040
can you default them to having an

1410
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,960
expiration date so by

1411
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,400
default all those you know files that

1412
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,000
people are sharing

1413
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,599
eventually you can't access them and you

1414
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,119
don't have to worry about those links

1415
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,560
leaking out or stuff like that and

1416
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,359
things like mail forwarding just shut it

1417
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,640
off

1418
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,400
why the hell do people need mail

1419
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,680
forwarding shut it off

1420
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,040
right so sorry to get aggressive there

1421
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,359
but

1422
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,640
some some things you can do to uh

1423
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,640
hopefully

1424
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,160
just make your systems more secure by

1425
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,000
default right

1426
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,680
that's more on the sas side of the house

1427
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,800
and then the infrastructure as a service

1428
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,879
side of the house

1429
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,880
like default to you know just no no

1430
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,640
public shares networks buckets like

1431
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,160
can you just like lock everything down

1432
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,680
more by default and someone has to

1433
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,520
explicitly open it up

1434
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,799
right because in the past it was more

1435
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,280
explicitly open

1436
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,440
or more uh implicitly open and that you

1437
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,200
had to explicitly close it down

1438
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,480
centralized access to something like

1439
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,640
amazon right like

1440
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,400
for us you have to go through uh g suite

1441
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,000
your g suite account and impersonate a

1442
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,599
role and that kind of thing you have you

1443
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,520
know certain groups and stuff

1444
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,200
um so no one should be actually logging

1445
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,759
in directly through aws they should be

1446
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,000
logging in through our idp and into you

1447
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,599
know

1448
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,440
their accounts and things like that can

1449
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,040
you automate scans static or dynamic

1450
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,640
scans if you're building software so

1451
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,400
that by default at least there's more

1452
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,920
checking before it ever hits

1453
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,440
production and then educate on that

1454
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,000
shared responsibility model we talked

1455
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,800
about

1456
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,480
where you are still responsible for

1457
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,880
security

1458
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,359
okay i hope you're still with me it's

1459
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,319
been about 45 minutes

1460
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,279
let's wrap up here so it's all about

1461
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,960
people

1462
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,480
i said a whole bunch of stuff i hope you

1463
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,040
go back and look at it i hope you've

1464
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,480
taken something with you so far but

1465
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,319
really what we need is aggression

1466
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,480
we need leaders we need aggression we

1467
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,240
can influence the battlefield we play in

1468
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,000
right that we have to monitor

1469
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,598
it's all people problems you gotta go

1470
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,520
build those relationships

1471
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,720
with other parts of the business with

1472
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,800
the board

1473
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,240
you know all progress is people all

1474
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,839
problems are people at least that's what

1475
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,919
i like to say so how can you

1476
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,680
go get more buy-in from business leaders

1477
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,200
or how can you work more with it

1478
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,960
how can you influence the mindset of

1479
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,799
your whole company so

1480
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,960
really what i'm talking about when i say

1481
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,000
drive default security is make it so

1482
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,200
people have to go

1483
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,839
out of their way to be insecure don't

1484
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,598
make it

1485
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,040
where they have to go out of their way

1486
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,480
to do the right thing

1487
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,480
make it where they have to go out of

1488
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,280
their way to do the wrong thing because

1489
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,319
if they just go

1490
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,680
forward they do the right thing and

1491
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,640
really what we're talking about here is

1492
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,720
culture

1493
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,480
right culture age strategy for breakfast

1494
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,480
famous quote by drucker but

1495
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,160
you know it's true like just build an

1496
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,160
environment where people are excited

1497
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,000
we give out you know military challenge

1498
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,879
coins when people report a security or

1499
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,880
privacy

1500
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,280
uh issue i've seen people give out

1501
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,400
stormtrooper helmets or gift cards or

1502
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,880
you know there's all sorts of other

1503
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,560
things um create that culture where

1504
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,359
people are excited to defend the

1505
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,480
business

1506
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:08,480
right because we are on different teams

1507
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,319
but we have the same mission i was

1508
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,440
fortunate the guy in the bottom right

1509
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,200
uh james wetherby to uh an astronaut to

1510
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,280
be at a couple events where he spoke and

1511
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,319
i got to spend time with him

1512
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,599
and he talked about how he would go

1513
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:26,480
and meet all these people working on the

1514
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,079
like on the space shuttle and such and

1515
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,520
really understand the motivations and

1516
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,720
stuff but also make sure they understood

1517
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,680
that he was a person

1518
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,839
that they weren't just building

1519
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,799
something to a schematic that they were

1520
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,279
actually

1521
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,880
shoving humans into this rocket and

1522
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,480
sending it into space and just creating

1523
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,680
that sort of emotional connection and

1524
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,200
that communication

1525
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,480
so you know you might need to do the

1526
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,000
same thing like hey man i'm not trying

1527
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,000
to say no i just

1528
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,160
i need your help right i need to we need

1529
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,640
to work together

1530
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,000
excuse me and then there's lots out

1531
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,720
there right there's a lot of different

1532
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,560
tools out there can you

1533
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,480
use some of these tools blend them with

1534
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,200
maybe the commercial tools you already

1535
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,359
have

1536
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,720
and you know build a better environment

1537
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,000
and like give you an example i have

1538
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,480
credit cards why are credit cards on

1539
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,960
there

1540
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,640
i've seen teams buy some cheap free paid

1541
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,040
credit cards and just sprinkle sprinkle

1542
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,400
the

1543
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,160
credit card numbers throughout their

1544
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,880
environment in little text files

1545
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,879
and if there's ever a charge on it boom

1546
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,079
someone is doing something wrong

1547
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,000
and it probably cost them a thousand

1548
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,640
dollars total to buy like 10 100

1549
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,599
cards so like can you think about these

1550
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,319
interesting things

1551
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,640
of how would i detect how would i you

1552
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,400
know

1553
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,960
again slow attackers down speed

1554
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,040
defenders up drive default security

1555
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,119
and you're probably sick of seeing

1556
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,680
slides like this maybe you're sick of

1557
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,040
giving a slide like this because often

1558
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,640
we say the attacker only has to be

1559
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,558
successful once but you're like a

1560
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,240
soccer goalie who has to stop 100 of the

1561
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
you know penalty kicks or whatever

1562
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,759
but i guess a lot of what we're saying

1563
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,920
too is once they land

1564
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,520
the minute they land in your environment

1565
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,119
it flips they should have to be a

1566
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,319
hundred percent perfect

1567
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,640
now i know that's a little bit of a

1568
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,160
dream but how close to that can you get

1569
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,680
like as soon as their behavior looks a

1570
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,480
little bit suspicious or they

1571
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,240
hit the wrong box or whatever they're

1572
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,559
they're they're caught

1573
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:13,680
so remember slow attackers down

1574
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,920
speed defenders or yourselves up

1575
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,118
and then how can you drive default

1576
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,040
security

1577
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,119
through your environment right

1578
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,359
discourage bad behavior enable good

1579
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,680
decisions

1580
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,598
so think about that i hope this helps

1581
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,960
and the final slide

1582
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,200
and then i'll take questions is

1583
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,079
my book recommendations i have tons

1584
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,160
happy to recommend

1585
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,760
all sorts of books tell me the topic

1586
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,920
i'll i'll probably have a book

1587
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,200
because i again huge book nerd but

1588
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,319
essentialism

1589
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,520
how do you focus on the vital few versus

1590
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,119
a trivial many

1591
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,759
extreme ownership is basically like we

1592
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,880
can always do more ourselves

1593
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,319
so have those retrospectives but like

1594
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,720
how could you have better communicated

1595
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,040
or

1596
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,799
prepped or whatever and then team of

1597
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,920
teams you know we're always working in

1598
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,040
environments where there's teams of

1599
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,880
teams and

1600
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,079
mcchrystal talks about fighting al qaeda

1601
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,599
and iraq as the

1602
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,440
commander of joint special operations

1603
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,920
command so you had these amazing

1604
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,680
special forces actually losing to

1605
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,040
al-qaeda and iraq until they made some

1606
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,319
some changes and a lot of it just dealt

1607
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,839
with information flow

1608
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,599
horizontal information flow getting

1609
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,680
people the information much more quickly

1610
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,119
less bureaucratic uh that kind of thing

1611
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,000
but all phenomenal reads and

1612
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,400
and i highly recommend them so um with

1613
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,520
that

1614
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,119
i will uh stop and take questions but i

1615
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,520
thank you so much for listening to me

1616
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,880
and i hope we can connect after this

1617
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,720
through email or

1618
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:45,839
a zoom call or on linkedin or something

1619
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:45,839
like that so thank you very much
