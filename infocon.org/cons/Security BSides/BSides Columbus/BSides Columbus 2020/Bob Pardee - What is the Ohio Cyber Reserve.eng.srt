1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,080
hi

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,160
and welcome to this session on the ohio

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,640
cyber reserve

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
this will give you a chance to get to

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,119
know a little bit about

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,439
what the ohio cyber reserve is uh

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,400
where it came from what we're doing now

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,359
and uh

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,680
where we plan to go in the future this

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,119
uh

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,040
will be a good session if you

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,399
have interest in the cyber reserve and

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,200
what it is what you can do for the

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,320
reserve what the reserve can do for you

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,000
and maybe if you're already involved and

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
you just want to know a little bit more

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,480
about how we got here

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,440
um this uh this session should cover a

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,440
little bit of all that

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,879
all right so some history you really

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
can't talk

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,919
about the history of the ohio cyber

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,720
reserve

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,439
without talking about the oc-3 the ohio

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,039
cyber collaboration committee

26
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,520
and this is a group that was formed by

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
the governor's office back in the kasich

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,199
administration

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,199
when the governor's office and

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,240
some of the legislature were really

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
concerned

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,079
about the growing cyber threat

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
and what it would mean to the state uh

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,919
we

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,880
we certainly had people doing uh cyber

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,280
protection

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,320
within the state for for state and local

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,759
governments

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,439
um and uh for our critical

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,920
infrastructure providers

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,279
but the the people doing it the the

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,479
number of people we had

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,759
was uh insufficient uh for

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,159
a large uh cyber attack if we ever came

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,880
under

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,079
that kind of attack and some of the

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
smaller

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,798
local government units really didn't

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,119
have the expertise that they needed

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
to respond so we really need to think

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,038
about that

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,598
and that was one of the the components

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,279
of

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:16,879
the oc3 as it was originally conceived

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:21,120
a second component of that was how do we

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,239
develop a cyber savvy workforce

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,760
and a third component is

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,800
where did uh where do these these

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,440
members of this group that we're we're

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,319
trying to

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,079
come up with that can help us respond to

62
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,760
to cyber incidents

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
how would they train where would they

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,079
train um

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
and when we talk about building a

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,640
workforce that is

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,680
able to respond to cyber incidents

68
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,559
how do we build a group like that and

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
how do we

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
uh provide them with a place to train

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,920
and how we

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,959
teach uh the in the k-12

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
and uh the higher education level how do

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,120
we teach

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,119
cyber security we need a

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,959
a place that that we can do that and so

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:18,800
a third of the the major initiatives of

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:22,560
the oc3 was the ohio cyber range

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,799
now when when they

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
first formed the ohio cyber

81
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,319
collaboration committee

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,519
uh it was actually the directors

83
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,879
of multiple organizations within the

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,959
state

85
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,079
so like the director of public safety

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,000
for the state the

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,120
the chief information security officer

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,159
for the state

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,720
um the adjutant general who you know

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,879
commands the national guard um

91
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
was uh was a member of that group and

92
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,040
and uh

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,439
people from uh otech which is

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
uh the parent organization of a number

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,480
of uh

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,640
of computing related uh

97
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,399
organizations for the state and for

98
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,679
higher ed in the state like the ohio

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
super computing center

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,959
and ornette that provides network

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,439
connectivity for higher ed in the state

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
so they got all these these director

103
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,040
level people

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,600
together and said this is a major

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
problem

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,120
we're gonna solve this problem figure it

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,000
out um

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
and of course those folks are are busy

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,960
and this was one of their many

110
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,039
competing uh priorities

111
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,599
so they appointed uh people that worked

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,479
for them

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
to to work on it and uh i was one of

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,320
those folks

115
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,880
uh i was working for the state cso at

116
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,960
the time

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,479
and was appointed to continue working on

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,080
oc-3 stuff as we tried to

119
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,039
to move it forward but even at that

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,639
level

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,880
really none of us were dedicated

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:04,320
uh in any large-scale meaningful way

123
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,159
to advancing the work of oc3 we

124
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,440
did make a little progress here and

125
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,960
there

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,520
we we succeeded in some

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,680
internal training and exercises kind of

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
things uh and better cooperation among

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,039
our

130
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,600
our constituents but really in terms of

131
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,880
uh

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
advancing the the major part of parts of

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,840
the

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,160
oc3 mission we we were just very slow

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,119
and that continued until the adjutant

136
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,280
general's office

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,240
hired a a civilian outreach coordinator

138
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,080
whose full-time job it was to push this

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,639
thing forward

140
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:51,280
and after that happened more and more

141
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,600
civilians and other individuals

142
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,320
both within state government but also

143
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
from uh

144
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
from industry started becoming involved

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
with oc3

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,080
and there were more people to work on

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,758
things and so we we really

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,680
were able to start pushing forward with

149
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,680
the effort

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,800
one of the things that we did was to

151
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,039
divide into subcommittees

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
that would each take one of those

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,560
problems a workforce development

154
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,758
subcommittee a cyber

155
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,039
incident response committee and uh

156
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,720
an ohio cyber range committee and

157
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,880
each of those um did their own work

158
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,960
and then came back and and met together

159
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,479
with the oc3 as a whole

160
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,919
and oc3 is still continuing to do

161
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,919
more of its missions um you know as

162
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,719
as the other components that

163
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,400
it was tasked with like this incident

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,919
civilian incident response

165
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,919
and the ohio cyber range

166
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,639
are spun off into their own entities

167
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,960
so one of these subcommittees was the

168
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,240
incident response subcommittee

169
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,080
and initially that was how we viewed it

170
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,479
how are we going to respond to a major

171
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,880
cyber incident

172
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,680
it would later come to be seen as the

173
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,840
preparedness and response committee

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,120
because we realized that that was uh

175
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,239
that was a

176
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,960
far better more holistic approach to the

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,319
the issue at hand so in 2016

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
the committee reviewed several possible

179
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,120
forms

180
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,280
of organization for the the

181
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,400
whatever these responses the civilian

182
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,559
response teams would turn out to be

183
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,960
and the the proposals included things

184
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,680
like

185
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
organizing them like community certs

186
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
under

187
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,800
the the ohio ema

188
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,599
or organizing them under the

189
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,960
ohio homeland securities cyber center

190
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,759
that they were building

191
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,400
um or you know just different places

192
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,599
that they

193
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
that it could be housed um but each of

194
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,840
those had

195
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,960
uh had issues whether it was uh

196
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,280
you know a lack of cyber security um

197
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,479
you know practice within that particular

198
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,758
organization

199
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,360
um or you know in the case of the state

200
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,520
cso's office we also looked at

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,440
organizing that under there um you know

202
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,919
the fact that they were already

203
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,280
spread very thin just uh protecting

204
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,280
state government without

205
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,919
uh without really pushing down to

206
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,880
responsibility for the local governments

207
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,598
and critical infrastructure across ohio

208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,519
um

209
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,159
or you know in terms of ohio homeland

210
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,640
there's a law enforcement tie-in with

211
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,040
them

212
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,560
and uh there there was concern that

213
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,719
maybe if

214
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,640
we formed these in such a way that there

215
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
was a law enforcement tie-in

216
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,199
some especially some of the private uh

217
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
organizations might not

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,880
want to open their doors in the middle

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
of an incident

220
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,320
to uh to these folks and say sure come

221
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,279
in and

222
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,000
you know have a look at exactly what

223
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
happened

224
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,519
uh because you know some things would

225
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,079
become public and some things might

226
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
become

227
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,839
uh a part of uh uh a

228
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
legal investigation against them and you

229
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,200
know

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
they they might not agree to allow the

231
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,360
organization

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,720
into their systems so uh

233
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,680
ultimately the the proposal that was

234
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
chosen by the

235
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,599
the subcommittee and proposed back to

236
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,000
oc3

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,519
was a committee or was a

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,480
organization where we would form an ohio

239
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,839
cyber reserve modeled on the ohio

240
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,680
military reserve

241
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,800
the ohio military reserve is also housed

242
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,000
within the adjutant general's office um

243
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,519
they are uh the

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,880
descendant uh i guess of uh ohio's

245
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,440
uh militia um they are one descendant of

246
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,160
that

247
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,519
the ohio national guard is another

248
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,880
descendant of uh

249
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,680
that that early militia as is the

250
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
ohio naval militia for those of you who

251
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,719
didn't know that we had a navy because

252
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,320
we were afraid we might get attacked by

253
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,160
canada at any point

254
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,480
well uh we we do um although uh that's

255
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,040
not

256
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
primarily their their role anymore but

257
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,760
uh

258
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,880
the point being there there were these

259
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,079
other groups

260
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,640
uh the the state's self-defense

261
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,279
forces under the adjutant general's

262
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,760
office

263
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,320
and this seemed like a good place for us

264
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,399
to put

265
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,120
the cyber reserve so

266
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,399
over the next year we we thought through

267
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,880
the idea

268
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,839
we uh we put it through multiple rounds

269
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
of review with

270
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
uh experts from around the state uh

271
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,359
various

272
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,320
participants within oc3 and uh

273
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,279
and continued to refine the proposal and

274
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,600
we got that

275
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,760
to the adjutant general's office into

276
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,720
their legislative affairs office

277
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,079
and they started pitching it out to uh

278
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,279
legislators

279
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,719
um so by the uh

280
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,920
the mid to end of 2018

281
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,040
the first bill proposing the

282
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,000
ohio cyber reserve actually was

283
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,640
posted in the ohio legislature it came

284
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
in

285
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,600
during lame duck session we didn't

286
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,640
really think that it was going to pass

287
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,160
before the everybody's terms expired and

288
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,800
we had to start over

289
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,399
but it was a great opportunity to build

290
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,359
awareness of the bill

291
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,160
and of the proposal for our cyber

292
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,959
reserve

293
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
and to to drum up support so that once

294
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,319
we

295
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,959
uh we started out in the new session

296
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,760
uh that we would have a much better

297
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,880
chance

298
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,399
to uh to hit the ground running and

299
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:04,560
get a new bill through more quickly

300
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:07,200
it was reintroduced in 2019

301
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,839
had very significant support right out

302
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,839
of the gate

303
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,760
uh obviously that uh that bill was uh

304
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,800
eventually

305
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,920
signed um by the governor and

306
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,599
uh we were we were good to go now

307
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,040
if you look in this picture i don't know

308
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,079
if you can see my um

309
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,519
my my pointer here okay so this guy this

310
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,638
guy this guy this guy

311
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,440
is okay so some somewhere over here

312
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,200
about three or four inches off the the

313
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,600
left side of your screen

314
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,440
you will you'll see me standing there

315
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,920
well you probably can't see me but

316
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,480
i i was i was in the room uh for the

317
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,360
signing

318
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,920
uh it was a great uh great day for for

319
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,639
all of us

320
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:55,120
uh who had uh worked a long time on this

321
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,160
so one of the things about this that

322
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,200
that just seemed

323
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,519
so unprecedented to me was uh

324
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,040
if you look this is senate bill 52 this

325
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,560
was the actual bill

326
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,079
and here's the voting records right

327
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,399
zero nay votes nobody voted against this

328
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,000
how

329
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,760
how often do you get that many

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,560
politicians in a room and

331
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
nobody votes against it everybody

332
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,880
understood

333
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,040
just how important this was and

334
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,279
everybody voted for it so it's a great

335
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,279
thing

336
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,880
so as it was as it passed

337
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:37,760
uh it took took effect on january 24th

338
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,880
of uh this year and it adds section 5922

339
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,240
to ohio revised code

340
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,160
and that section actually is sort of

341
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
nestled in with the sections on the

342
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,279
military reserve

343
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,720
and the ohio national guard and that

344
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,760
kind of thing

345
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,800
and it specifically clarifies that

346
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,360
uh that this is a a state

347
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,079
specific unit and uh can't be called

348
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,519
into federal service

349
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,479
it appropriated some funds for us to get

350
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,680
started

351
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,399
and then it addressed a number of

352
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,760
issues uh about exactly what it was we

353
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,040
were talking about here

354
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,760
and where it fit so it places us as part

355
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,079
of the

356
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,720
the state self-defense forces

357
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,638
and it addressed a number of issues that

358
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,720
we were concerned about because

359
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,440
other states had tried to stand up

360
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,560
civilian incident response capabilities

361
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,560
before but none of them

362
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
at the time that we were drafting all

363
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,279
this none of them had ever been

364
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,160
used and the reason that that was

365
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,320
was they were missing significant pieces

366
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,120
of what we built into this bill

367
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:54,240
so the first thing was liability

368
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,120
none of those other units

369
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,839
had been structured in such a way that

370
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,480
when

371
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,160
people were acting as part of this

372
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,040
civilian incident response

373
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
corps for their state that they were

374
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,480
acting

375
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,199
as agents of the state they were all

376
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,880
acting as

377
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,279
individuals coming to the state's aid

378
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,279
but where that left them was from the

379
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,279
standpoint of liability if anything went

380
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,320
wrong if they made any mistakes

381
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,760
if anything happened as a result of

382
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,880
of their duties they were personally

383
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,079
liable

384
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,800
uh and that that really uh caused some

385
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,439
concern

386
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,560
for them and for the organizations not

387
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
really wanting to

388
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,680
uh deploy them because uh nobody wanted

389
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,279
to expose their members to

390
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,479
to personal liability so

391
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,120
our bill actually clarified that that

392
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,160
when called the state active duty we are

393
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
actually

394
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,360
acting as agents of the state and we

395
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,040
have the same protections from personal

396
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,360
liability that

397
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,399
that state employees do when they're

398
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,040
acting in the scope of their duties

399
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,480
it also provides employment protection

400
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,599
and this was another reason that

401
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,440
people might be sometimes afraid to

402
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,839
call these units out we do our best to

403
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,120
work

404
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,680
with employers to structure people's

405
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,600
duties

406
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:25,120
around their their work responsibilities

407
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,320
we try to be very employer friendly

408
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,480
as an organization and and show the

409
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
the employers the benefits that they

410
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,000
will get in terms of training and

411
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,279
exposure for their people

412
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,639
um as opposed to uh you know well we're

413
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,360
just gonna take your people whenever we

414
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,639
want them and

415
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,759
and all that but uh ultimately if the

416
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,399
the governor's office does call people

417
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,759
up and says you are mandated to go

418
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,040
someplace

419
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,560
to respond to some major incident

420
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,759
they are protected in the same way that

421
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,560
national guard are protected

422
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,519
their jobs are protected they have a job

423
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,240
to go back to

424
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,240
when it's over

425
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,039
so on january 25th shortly after the

426
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,160
the law actually went into effect

427
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,199
members met for a

428
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
symposium uh and this is the i'm sorry

429
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,280
these were

430
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,039
these were the people who had expressed

431
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,760
the desire to become members

432
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,240
and gone through a uh a whole

433
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,559
qualification process

434
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,000
to determine their fitness for

435
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,360
membership

436
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,760
those folks were called into this

437
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,120
symposium they were

438
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,160
given presentations on what was going on

439
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,520
and where this all fit

440
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,559
into uh the efforts of uh of the state

441
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,760
government and

442
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,678
public safety and other other areas uh

443
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:02,480
and also uh even within the context

444
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:05,600
of uh of efforts of this sort nationally

445
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,120
and then we were all given uh

446
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,840
a stack of papers to sign uh with ndas

447
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,199
and code of conduct and permission to

448
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,240
uh to perform background checks and

449
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,840
uh responsibility for uh

450
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,919
taking care of any equipment we were

451
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,720
assigned and all kinds of uh

452
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,000
uh things that we had to sign and then

453
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,360
at the end of the day

454
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,720
um the first round of members uh

455
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,479
were signed in or sworn in uh

456
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,559
in an official ceremony uh to

457
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,280
be the first set of members of the ohio

458
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,280
cyber reserve

459
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,559
all right so a little bit about the

460
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,199
structure

461
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,720
so the ohio cyber reserve is actually

462
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,919
composed of small

463
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,480
teams um anywhere from 10 to 12

464
00:18:51,919 --> 00:19:00,080
individuals uh per team and uh

465
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,120
these individuals are are

466
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,918
selected to teams or will be selected to

467
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,199
teams

468
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,160
uh based on specific skills needed in

469
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,440
each team

470
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,840
so this the teams are each

471
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,640
going to have a set of complementary

472
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,760
skills

473
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,760
uh within them so that we don't have

474
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,879
uh somebody going out to respond to a

475
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,360
website defacement when everybody on the

476
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
team

477
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,959
are hardcore network people uh you you

478
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,080
need a

479
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,280
set of skills so uh

480
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,559
we're going to have uh teams like this

481
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,799
all around the state eventually

482
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,559
and each team is going to have um

483
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,720
10 to 12 members with complementary

484
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,480
skills and

485
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,559
each team will probably have some

486
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,679
strengths and and so on that they can

487
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,039
bring to bear

488
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:58,160
and teams will support one another with

489
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,360
with special strengths that that a given

490
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,880
team might have

491
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,399
so it's not as if because an incident is

492
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,760
happening in cleveland

493
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,320
and that team is uh is on it and

494
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,200
it's a hospital and we have somebody in

495
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,360
columbus

496
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,799
who happens to be an expert in medical

497
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,559
device technology

498
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,799
uh it's not like that cleveland team

499
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,360
can't get access to that expertise

500
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,000
uh that is that's kind of built into our

501
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,799
our

502
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,840
thinking and the way we're structuring

503
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,240
things

504
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,120
but in terms of who actually goes out to

505
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,039
a response

506
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,360
that initial set of responders that will

507
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,720
be a local team

508
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,639
um for now

509
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,840
we're uh we're a little more limited

510
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,240
because we we

511
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,559
were just standing up but uh eventually

512
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,039
we will have one to two

513
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,760
in each of uh a number of regional

514
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,960
geographic areas

515
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,960
so again most of the

516
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
members are going to have highly

517
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,000
experience are going to be highly

518
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,679
experienced

519
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,640
technical operators in cyber security

520
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,240
and you know have these deep cyber

521
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,440
backgrounds

522
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,799
but there are some other skill sets um

523
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,919
that we need and we we will definitely

524
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
be considering

525
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,600
people who bring those skill sets with

526
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,440
them

527
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:25,039
so one is a type of individual

528
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,400
that we we have definitely already

529
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,080
brought one of those on board these are

530
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,880
individuals with deep ties

531
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,799
and influence in a broad geographic or

532
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,919
professional community

533
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:43,360
so this might be somebody who

534
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:47,120
would have a regional

535
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,360
um you know coalition kind of focus

536
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,158
and and really be well known in that

537
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,120
region

538
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,679
and uh no you know know all the people

539
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,199
that

540
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,280
that you need to talk to knows how to

541
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,799
grease the wheels those people are

542
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,000
extremely valuable

543
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,760
same way um if we had somebody

544
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,280
uh you know in a professional

545
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,440
association uh

546
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,799
where we thought we might be uh doing

547
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
something with that

548
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,360
uh with that area so if there was some

549
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,000
professional association of uh

550
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,678
wastewater treatment people and uh you

551
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,520
know the person who was president of

552
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,679
that association and knew everybody in

553
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,600
wastewater treatment across the state

554
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,799
decided they wanted to be part of the

555
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,480
the cyber reserve

556
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,559
even though they didn't really have

557
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,559
cyber skills

558
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,639
that's another type of person that we

559
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,678
might be looking for

560
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,440
to to help us in

561
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,720
in gaining penetration into those

562
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,280
areas that we will be working with

563
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,919
second type of individual we're looking

564
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,280
at

565
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,400
are people who may not be working in

566
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,440
cyber per se but they may have uh

567
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,880
deep expertise in a particular area that

568
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,000
we're likely to work with

569
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,360
um especially like the on the industrial

570
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
control side

571
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,240
or the medical operations side

572
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,760
voting infrastructure um you know

573
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,520
some other form of critical

574
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,320
infrastructure operations

575
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,240
uh you know pipeline operations or uh

576
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,520
power transmission operations

577
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,240
uh telecom you know people that

578
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,918
that may understand how the guts of our

579
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,320
infrastructure work

580
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,280
they may not necessarily have the cyber

581
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,000
background

582
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,879
but they want to bring that expertise

583
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,360
and

584
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,000
you know they will gain cyber skills and

585
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,000
we will gain

586
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,200
skills in the critical infrastructure

587
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,440
you know and how the guts of that work

588
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,480
that's uh that's another type of person

589
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,400
that we're looking for

590
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,679
even if they don't have that that deep

591
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
cyber uh

592
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,440
you know security background and then

593
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,480
the third

594
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,960
type of individual we're looking at

595
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,960
would be educators and professional

596
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,640
technical trainers

597
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,520
individuals that can stand in front of

598
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,360
groups of people and talk

599
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,440
this this is partly to help us with

600
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,559
one of our missions which includes going

601
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,919
out and

602
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,879
helping schools set up cyber clubs

603
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,679
and partly in just that general

604
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,720
education

605
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,760
and bringing the cyber security uh

606
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,159
level of the community up uh so it may

607
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,679
be

608
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,640
speaking engagements for uh

609
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,360
for community organizations and that

610
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,039
kind of thing

611
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,879
that want somebody to come in and talk

612
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,120
about cyber

613
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,120
talk about protecting themselves online

614
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,360
and that kind of thing

615
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,158
but another area that having the

616
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
educators

617
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,400
in there would be really helpful from

618
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,840
is if we have k-12 educators

619
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,799
who want to become involved and want to

620
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,720
help

621
00:24:52,799 --> 00:25:00,158
us start seeding these cyber clubs

622
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,480
in schools they can talk you know k-12

623
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,600
educator to k-12 educator to

624
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,720
the people in those other schools and

625
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,840
uh help them with their uh you know

626
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,200
ability to to push these clubs out and

627
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
we want to get that down

628
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,720
there's there's a template uh called the

629
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,760
the

630
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,799
cyber club in a box that ohio department

631
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,640
of education

632
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:28,240
has uh has developed

633
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,880
and there are components to that that uh

634
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,840
that we have reviewed and commented on

635
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,080
and we will be

636
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,879
uh helping to implement that with

637
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
schools

638
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,440
uh and so having uh educators uh that

639
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,480
that might have an interest in

640
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,400
being being involved with us

641
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,080
is another area that we're really

642
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,200
interested in getting

643
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:53,520
you know some some people

644
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,880
outside our traditional realm involved

645
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,918
and then another type of membership

646
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,400
so up until now we've been talking about

647
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,559
the regular members of the reserve

648
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
but there's another type of membership

649
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,720
that we always

650
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,399
recognized was probably going to be a um

651
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,240
an area that we wanted to become

652
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,159
involved in and that's

653
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,520
the what we call the associate member

654
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,039
program

655
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,000
so associate members are individuals who

656
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,600
either don't have not had the

657
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,720
opportunity to

658
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,480
get the experience but they have um

659
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,679
a background that might help them um

660
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,760
or or they've they've got

661
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,200
a background but it's not quite where

662
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,760
they need to be

663
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,400
in terms of cyber to be involved with

664
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
the reserve

665
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,600
so what were what we were thinking was

666
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,678
you got these students in cyber security

667
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,480
programs degree programs

668
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,760
um who are coming out and they're being

669
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,120
told by

670
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,879
the the employers

671
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,959
this is an entry level position and we

672
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:10,000
want two years of experience

673
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,559
how somebody for an entry-level job is

674
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,520
supposed to get two years of experience

675
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,039
i'm not sure

676
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,360
when nobody will hire them until they

677
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,440
have two years of experience

678
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,360
but one of the thoughts with the

679
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,240
associate membership program is we can

680
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,520
get these people

681
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,279
working side by side with really

682
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,879
highly experienced cyber security

683
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,360
professionals doing

684
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,039
useful work in their community and they

685
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,080
can build that up and they can put that

686
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,480
on their resume and

687
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,199
look we have this uh you know practical

688
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,760
hands-on

689
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,840
experience that we've built up by being

690
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,840
involved with the ohio cyber reserve

691
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,200
the another really

692
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,480
good way that we uh think that uh some

693
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,679
of these folks might be

694
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,480
uh used is that many of the associate

695
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,240
members

696
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,360
um being you know college

697
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,720
level or or just out of college um

698
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,360
are probably maybe more relatable to

699
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,480
uh some of the the k-12 students in the

700
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,719
cyber clubs

701
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,399
uh than some of our members uh will be

702
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,760
not that not that we're not all

703
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,879
relatable just

704
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,799
uh you know that it provides another

705
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,679
touch point that we might be able to

706
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,240
uh reach out to some of these kids and

707
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,080
uh

708
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:34,720
and get them interested in cyber

709
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:38,000
and then the last group of um

710
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,279
and these are not members but this is a

711
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,159
another group is affiliates or friends

712
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,240
of the ohio cyber reserve so these are

713
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,279
people who have expressed an interest in

714
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,159
helping us

715
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,880
but they are not for whatever reason

716
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,520
they're not

717
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,919
uh willing not able uh you know cannot

718
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,440
make

719
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:01,039
a uh a commitment a service commitment

720
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,640
to becoming a member of the reserve

721
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,600
so uh these are folks who

722
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,559
have some some specific expertise that

723
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,240
they would like to share

724
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,799
and uh they are willing to

725
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,360
take a phone call and watch somebody

726
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,799
through

727
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,678
things or maybe come out and uh teach a

728
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,480
seminar for the members on a particular

729
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,279
topic

730
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,679
that is uh really in demand things like

731
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,720
uh

732
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,440
you know some of the uh

733
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,919
specifics of manufacturing environments

734
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,279
or

735
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,960
uh industrial controls uh or

736
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,919
uh um you know running a a

737
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,880
gas pipeline or an electric company or

738
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,559
something like that

739
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,240
some of these folks who really

740
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,960
understand that

741
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,919
but can't quite make that service

742
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,760
commitment

743
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,679
can express interest in becoming an

744
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,760
affiliate and

745
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,799
what they what they will do is consult

746
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,679
over the phone

747
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,440
with members and and possibly provide

748
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,840
some training opportunities

749
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,320
for members and this is a way to become

750
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,039
involved even

751
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,399
even if uh like your employer is just

752
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,520
dead set against having

753
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,840
you join or something like that uh or

754
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
you

755
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,000
uh you have other reasons that you that

756
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,640
you know that you can't uh

757
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,840
you know go out to to the scene of the

758
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,840
of an incident response

759
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:36,399
okay so our short term structure is uh

760
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:40,000
we we built the the first set of teams

761
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,719
with just experienced individuals and we

762
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,159
we wanted to take the most experienced

763
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,279
folks

764
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,279
and put everybody else into the

765
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,039
affiliate program for now

766
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,480
uh because there there aren't processes

767
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,600
and procedures built

768
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,679
uh everything is brand new uh and we

769
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,240
needed people who could sail the ship

770
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,200
while we were building it uh and that's

771
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,600
that's what we've got

772
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,799
in the reserve right now uh we have

773
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,840
three teams

774
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,559
uh cleveland columbus and cincinnati um

775
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,678
and we've got

776
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,678
a lot of interest in dayton and uh so

777
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,840
that is likely to be the next full team

778
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,840
that we established

779
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,840
and over time we're going to grow that

780
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,480
out

781
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,240
to reasons all around the state and each

782
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,760
region having probably

783
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,320
more than one team in in the region

784
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,240
so that we can uh respond to multiple

785
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,360
events or we can respond to an event and

786
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,960
then refresh

787
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,199
people as uh as people have been on duty

788
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,840
uh working an event for a long period of

789
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,360
time

790
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,480
um excuse me

791
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,678
yeah true true story here um i uh

792
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,640
went out uh yesterday for uh for code

793
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,320
testing

794
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,679
um and have not heard uh back yet but

795
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,439
i'm sure everything's fine and and i am

796
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,039
recording this on a mac and max don't

797
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,320
get viruses so

798
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,440
you you're safe anyway um

799
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,760
back to the presentation yes so uh

800
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,640
uh over time we're going to build this

801
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,360
out and

802
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,159
people with with good cyber security

803
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,519
skills

804
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,000
uh that that need

805
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,120
to be trained more into some of the

806
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,799
roles

807
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,959
are going to be brought in and

808
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,000
we're going to grow our numbers out uh

809
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,159
considerably from here

810
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,840
so one of the things people ask about is

811
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,399
uniforms because you know they

812
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,158
they know we're uh we're organized under

813
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,760
the adjutant general and

814
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,440
you know people are trying to figure out

815
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,840
are we going to be like in

816
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,559
army-looking uniforms or what but no our

817
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,399
uniform

818
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:56,000
is a polo shirt like this with

819
00:32:52,399 --> 00:33:00,320
the ohio cyber reserve logo on

820
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,919
it and a

821
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:07,519
lanyard with your badge on it and

822
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,919
khakis so very similar to

823
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,519
what many of the people that we will be

824
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,840
going out and visiting with

825
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,279
uh might be wearing on a on a daily

826
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,080
basis and that was uh

827
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,519
that was another kind of part of the

828
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,519
decision to go this route

829
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:30,000
okay so uh we are investing

830
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,880
money in the membership uh it takes uh

831
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,039
cash to do uh background checks takes

832
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,000
cash to uh

833
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,039
create credentials and uh purchase

834
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,360
equipment

835
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,679
to assign to people and it takes a lot

836
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:48,559
of money to do training

837
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:51,600
so that kind of money

838
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,080
requires that we should make some kind

839
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,039
of an

840
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,600
annual service commitment to the reserve

841
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,200
what we

842
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,639
what we're trying to to show is that the

843
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,679
money that is being poured into members

844
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,440
is coming back in terms of service uh

845
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,918
what we don't want is to

846
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,720
send somebody through some certification

847
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,918
pathway

848
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,560
or you know to to send them someplace

849
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,158
for a special training and then have

850
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,359
them leave right after

851
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,200
or have them uh not actually spend any

852
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,918
time on the reserve for the rest of the

853
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,399
year

854
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,118
um so we're asking for a minimum annual

855
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,239
service

856
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,639
commitment uh there's no minimum

857
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,359
uh commitment in terms of enlistment

858
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,919
term

859
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,960
you know term of years uh that may

860
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,598
eventually come

861
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,320
as we figure out what uh what is needed

862
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,000
to kind of

863
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,280
uh show value for for the amount of

864
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,960
uh stuff that we put in but uh this is

865
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,000
entirely voluntary

866
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,639
and before people uh before we start

867
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,680
training and doing the more costly

868
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,599
things

869
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,759
with the current membership you know

870
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,400
there they will be

871
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,119
led to understand what that that entails

872
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,240
in terms of

873
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:12,079
uh future commitment uh and uh

874
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:16,000
their uh um association

875
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,720
is at will uh even you know if uh if we

876
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,760
do end up uh training people and they

877
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,040
have to

878
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,000
leave for some other reason um

879
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,839
there there will be options like uh you

880
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,839
know buying out the cost of training

881
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,920
that you were

882
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:36,078
uh you know given or something like that

883
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,640
um or uh you know if it's for some

884
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,839
disability reason that you uh that is

885
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,560
out of your control

886
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,759
uh you know the the those those kinds of

887
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,279
things they're going to make

888
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,359
accommodation for

889
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,640
but we're going to uh expect a level of

890
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:55,759
uh output from the

891
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,680
what the reserve actually invests in

892
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,720
people

893
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,279
so how does somebody uh become

894
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,439
involved or express their interest in

895
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,680
the cyber reserve

896
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,560
um well the first thing i would do is

897
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,960
check out the first two links here

898
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,759
one is just new some general news about

899
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,000
it uh

900
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,200
it talks about the the legislation that

901
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,200
was passed and

902
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,480
what it's all about and the second is

903
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,319
the actual section

904
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,040
of the ohio uh reserve uh ohio revised

905
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,130
code

906
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,599
that that forms the ohio cyber reserve

907
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:33,119
[Music]

908
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:36,240
so you can see all of ohio's laws

909
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,560
on codes.ohio.gov

910
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,640
and this one happens to be the ohio

911
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,839
revised code

912
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,000
section 5922 so

913
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,200
go out and check that out and if that

914
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,079
still sounds

915
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,680
uh potentially interesting to you then

916
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,599
the next step is to sign up for an

917
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,919
account in apan

918
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,200
this is an external partner network run

919
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,560
by dod

920
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,598
that allows people to sign up

921
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:08,000
for a free account and then

922
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:11,280
be able to interact with the dod or with

923
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,720
the national guard for uh

924
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,720
for various purposes and uh

925
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,118
once you sign up for a free account

926
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,799
there then you will connect back in

927
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:26,800
with uh to following this link

928
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:31,680
and that will take you to a survey

929
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,040
and an opportunity to express interest

930
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,040
and don't worry that slide is going to

931
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,320
be reported repeated at the end of the

932
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,000
the deck

933
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,119
and the deck is going to be available um

934
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,200
from uh from the b sides uh

935
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,160
so that you you'll be able to to get a

936
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,520
hold of that

937
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,799
uh and easily find the uh the

938
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,280
sign up link so what happens after you

939
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,040
express

940
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,880
interest well then there's a whole

941
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,040
intake process

942
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,240
once somebody expresses an interest in

943
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,880
becoming a member

944
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,959
um there's a whole series of things that

945
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,240
happens the

946
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,359
individual is sent a questionnaire and

947
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,879
this is to gather information about your

948
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,598
your strengths uh things that you know

949
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,000
uh or believe that you you could prove

950
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,280
that

951
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,480
uh you know that you're able to do

952
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,839
it also is a quick

953
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,599
very uh very high level quiz

954
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,119
just to show that you have some

955
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,000
background uh in

956
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,760
cyber security and uh or i t you know

957
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,119
that kind of thing

958
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,480
um those get reviewed and

959
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,320
uh if you pass sort of that

960
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:50,000
that quick sniff test kind of uh

961
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:53,920
quiz and survey then you'll be

962
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,119
referred to uh actually getting a test

963
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,320
uh the testing is uh

964
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,160
done after uh after

965
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,720
an evaluation of how you did on that

966
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,520
survey because the testing's not free

967
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,359
uh we we actually pay a third party

968
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,599
testing organization to provide

969
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:16,000
uh testing for uh cyber security talent

970
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,680
and we don't want to spend that money

971
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,200
for people that are clearly

972
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,759
not not really ready for for it

973
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,759
and wouldn't do well so

974
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,480
[Music]

975
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,280
assuming that you do well enough on that

976
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,770
then you will

977
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,400
be sent for this test the test

978
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,400
[Music]

979
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,240
there there are multiple versions of the

980
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,920
test that

981
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,359
measure your your capabilities in

982
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,960
various areas

983
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:50,078
so uh you may choose a test

984
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,440
uh that is oriented towards something

985
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,520
specific so if you're

986
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,280
you know primarily involved in

987
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,520
application security you might

988
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,200
take the application security test if

989
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,359
you're primarily involved in

990
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,720
industrial control security you might

991
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:06,078
take that test

992
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,959
um but

993
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,440
that that's uh that's where where it

994
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,680
goes

995
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:17,359
and then uh when a group of members

996
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,078
has taken that um the uh

997
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,560
there's a review board and these review

998
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,960
boards

999
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,078
meet periodically so it's not like it

1000
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,720
will happen immediately

1001
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,440
after you take your test um the review

1002
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,799
board

1003
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,599
looks through all these testing results

1004
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,520
um and we'll also look at the ones that

1005
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,720
didn't proceed to testing

1006
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,200
and see who they we want to offer

1007
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,959
membership or associate membership to

1008
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,000
because even some of the people that

1009
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,560
might not uh it might be clear from

1010
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,119
their

1011
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,680
survey results that they're not ready

1012
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,640
for

1013
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,040
regular membership may may be good for

1014
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,920
the

1015
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,160
the affiliate program or i'm sorry for

1016
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,280
the

1017
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,200
associate membership program

1018
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,280
um and after that

1019
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,720
there's a forum that's han that's held

1020
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,960
multiple times a year

1021
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,399
where the candidate the candidates get

1022
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,760
an introduction to the

1023
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,359
reserve meet a bunch of members uh

1024
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,400
they'll sign all their paperwork and

1025
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,400
then get sworn in

1026
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,520
so our current activity

1027
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,280
um some provisional team leads

1028
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,599
uh and assistant leads have been

1029
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,560
appointed for each of the regional teams

1030
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,079
so we have leadership within the

1031
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,560
national guard that is

1032
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,359
uh actually kind of overseeing the

1033
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,960
effort

1034
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:44,078
although they are really edging the

1035
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,359
cyber reserve in the direction of as

1036
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,800
much self-governance as as we can

1037
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,598
can take on um so

1038
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,400
the master handbook has been developed

1039
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,760
and it

1040
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,480
is undergoing ongoing refinement uh it

1041
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,680
provides a

1042
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,079
high level outline of how the

1043
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,279
reserve is structured and and some of

1044
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,560
our operations our

1045
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,160
missions that kind of thing um these

1046
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,599
provisional team leaders

1047
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:18,078
um have been appointed

1048
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,920
by the uh the um

1049
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,119
commander of the ohio self-defense

1050
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,599
forces which is

1051
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,520
the my my perception of it is that's

1052
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,280
everybody outside of the national guard

1053
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,920
within the adjutant general's office

1054
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,040
that is

1055
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,839
you know so that's us and it's the ohio

1056
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,440
military reserve and ohio naval militia

1057
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,640
uh those folks uh so appointed they

1058
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,319
appointed uh

1059
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,400
individuals for the term of one year

1060
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,440
um so that we can start getting a

1061
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,920
feeling for who

1062
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,800
really wants to do what in the long term

1063
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,920
um

1064
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:59,040
each of the teams was appointed

1065
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:03,040
two co-leads and two co-uh

1066
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,400
leads and so so four leads

1067
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:10,480
in each region to help start

1068
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,480
kick-starting this whole effort

1069
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,680
the provisional team leads have been

1070
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,040
meeting

1071
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,240
uh weekly uh every other week uh

1072
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,480
the whole state team uh so all the

1073
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,319
team leads from all the regions meet and

1074
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,440
then on the off weeks

1075
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:31,359
then the individual teams uh

1076
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:34,560
their leadership needs uh each region

1077
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,359
um has also connected at least one town

1078
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,160
hall

1079
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,119
uh to meet with all of the members in

1080
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,399
the region

1081
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,200
and uh start giving them a feeling for

1082
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,280
where we're at

1083
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,799
what uh what we need their help with

1084
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,880
what efforts are underway

1085
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,920
and so on and get their questions

1086
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,520
answered

1087
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,640
and there is a plan for a

1088
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,960
a statewide town hall to be coming up

1089
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,680
here

1090
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,720
soon it may have happened by the time uh

1091
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,720
by the time you see this

1092
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:11,040
so our current effort is massive

1093
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,359
we are essentially standing up a whole

1094
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,720
new arm of state government

1095
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:19,860
from scratch um we don't have

1096
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,680
any of the charter or or

1097
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:24,480
[Music]

1098
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,960
documented standards policies procedures

1099
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,359
that

1100
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,800
any of the other uh pieces of state

1101
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,960
government have

1102
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,359
you know from their years of existence

1103
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,160
so we have to develop all of that

1104
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,440
we do have some stuff that the guard is

1105
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,040
able to share with us

1106
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,880
we have some stuff that the ohio

1107
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,279
military reserve has been able to share

1108
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,359
with

1109
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,440
us some things that the state ciso's

1110
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,480
office has been able to share with us

1111
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,040
but for the most part we are

1112
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,000
uh defining our own standard operating

1113
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,279
procedures

1114
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,400
our own policies our own hr policies

1115
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,520
everything that you have to do to uh

1116
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,480
to create a mid-sized organization we

1117
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,000
are doing that

1118
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,480
from scratch right now and so one of the

1119
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,760
main

1120
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,480
areas that our membership is involved

1121
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,359
with

1122
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,960
at the moment is actually developing our

1123
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,960
standard operating procedures

1124
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,319
we have a number of work groups that are

1125
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,599
spinning up

1126
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:26,800
to uh to uh do a lot of this

1127
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:30,079
uh policy and procedure development um

1128
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,839
and this is really important um

1129
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,839
to uh to get all this

1130
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:41,440
finalized and formalized so that we can

1131
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,279
actually show people that we have

1132
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,359
uh operating procedures we have

1133
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,040
standards that we follow

1134
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,400
and so on before we can even start to

1135
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,680
consider ourselves

1136
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,680
operationally capable

1137
00:45:54,079 --> 00:46:01,040
and then once we actually

1138
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,118
have the the team structure uh

1139
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,160
finalized as part of you know the stuff

1140
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,160
that we're doing

1141
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,160
we are saying these are the skills that

1142
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,040
must be on a team

1143
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,920
a lot of that is laid out in the master

1144
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,640
handbook

1145
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,880
but we are reviewing revising based on

1146
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,279
what we know that we're going to need

1147
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,040
and once we have that then we can start

1148
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,319
to slot individual members

1149
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:27,119
into individual positions and assess

1150
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,720
their readiness to perform that job

1151
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,480
that doesn't mean oh you don't get the

1152
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,439
job if you're not ready

1153
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,119
means we need we know then what we need

1154
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,680
to do

1155
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,640
so once we have clear criteria that we

1156
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,560
can measure

1157
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,400
folks against then we can start to

1158
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,440
measure the individuals

1159
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,880
and the teams as a whole and

1160
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,640
address any training needs

1161
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,680
certifications required

1162
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,879
and so on so that we can show that our

1163
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,359
members are

1164
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,960
ready and that's that's important

1165
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,759
because

1166
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,720
when we go to an entity and say we are

1167
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,880
going to

1168
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,640
help you respond to this incident or we

1169
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,480
are going to help you build a cyber

1170
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,279
security program

1171
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,319
if we cannot show that our people are

1172
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,319
qualified

1173
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,359
and the standards that they're qualified

1174
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,560
against

1175
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:19,598
um how can we uh

1176
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,160
get people to trust us that that yes we

1177
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,960
are

1178
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,558
qualified to help them uh either through

1179
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,839
a disaster or

1180
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,960
help them build their security program

1181
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,720
um leadership's also starting to talk

1182
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,400
about the need to practice

1183
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:39,520
uh begin practicing things as a team

1184
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,920
because even for those individuals who

1185
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,040
are

1186
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,040
highly qualified and uh and

1187
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,720
even the ones that are highly qualified

1188
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,200
in incident response which

1189
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,799
is uh another thing because many of the

1190
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,118
folks that we're bringing in

1191
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:57,839
um are experienced cyber security pros

1192
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,400
but not necessarily an incident response

1193
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,599
so if

1194
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,000
if you're a career red teamer

1195
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,359
and you come into the reserve you will

1196
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,319
get trained into an

1197
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:09,040
a response into a blue team role that

1198
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,920
you will

1199
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,279
carry out in the midst of a uh of a

1200
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,520
major

1201
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,400
cyber incident that that we get called

1202
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,359
out to

1203
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,839
uh because at that point we're not

1204
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,839
looking to

1205
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,079
to perform red team activities we are

1206
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,760
looking to help

1207
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,119
the organization with their blue team

1208
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,400
stuff so

1209
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,280
we need to make sure that that everybody

1210
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,000
is in a role that is useful in the

1211
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,200
particular

1212
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,160
response that we're in um and that they

1213
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,839
have been assessed

1214
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,279
but then also that we've been assessed

1215
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,880
as a team uh

1216
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,640
because as we start to work together

1217
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,680
even the people who are

1218
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,920
highly uh capable in incident response

1219
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,440
to start out with probably haven't

1220
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,440
worked together

1221
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,720
and have not worked under the standard

1222
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,640
operating procedures

1223
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,640
that we are developing so we need to

1224
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,680
start doing that

1225
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,960
and we are working with

1226
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,759

1227
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,040
those other

1228
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,680
oc-3 efforts and

1229
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,440

1230
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,240

1232
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,200
we can take with us to

1234

the k-12s when we do our uh

1235
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,480

1238
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,760
