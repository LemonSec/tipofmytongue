1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,960
good morning it's about time to start so

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,120
thanks for tuning in to patch management

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,440
cornerstone and cyber security

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,879
my name is joe cummins i want to start

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,559
off by admitting this is a selfish

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,880
presentation

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,880
it's a collection of things i have

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,359
learned over the last 20 years that make

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,840
my job

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,680
easier most of the content is based off

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,840
basic computer practices

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,759
if you've been working in it for a few

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,198
years much of the content will sound

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,599
familiar

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,439
it really is about managing basics but

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,320
the spin i want to put on it is how to

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,559
manage

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
is how managing these things can help

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,280
reduce the time and energy it takes to

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
run a monthly

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,200
patch process turns out those things

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,000
also help reduce time and effort for

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
some security processes as well

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
most of the presentation is black and

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,760
white except for a few color

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,440
color slides see if you notice them i

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,718
was also intrigued with

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,879
slide transitions so warning

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
someone might be a little goofy the

30
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,760
first group of slides about me

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,680
where i worked what i learned next group

32
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,240
of slides

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
is about those things that relate to

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
patching the last group is about the

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,320
process and how those things can affect

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,158
it

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,679
so you may ask yourself because i ask

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
myself this all the time

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,400
same job for 20 years how did you do

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that well fortunately i landed a few

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
great companies along the way

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,200
and the tools and techniques used to

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,520
secure workstation

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,640
have changed enough in that time to keep

45
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
it interesting

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,840
i've also been consulting on the side

47
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,679
for decades

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
the evolution of securing a business is

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
constantly changing

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,119
you must be ready i spent hours

51
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,399
researching new technologies

52
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,560
investing investigating patch issues

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,119
researching vulnerabilities and keeping

54
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,200
up with the latest cyber security news

55
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,799
at this point i'd like to find out who i

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
was talking to but i don't think i'll be

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,880
able to do that

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,119
so i'm going to assume that we are all

59
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,079
interested in patching

60
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,439
and that you have a process in place you

61
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,600
might want to prove it or you're

62
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,758
starting a process

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
i do want to emphasize this is a

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,200
workstation patching uh

65
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,160
process non-server but you know those

66
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,679
processes are similar enough um this the

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
concept should apply to anything that

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,720
needs to be patched

69
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,920
and i do use asset machine pc

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,120
computer and workstation interchangeably

71
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,679
it should make sense though

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,560
so who am i um i've been involved in the

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,440
i.t world since 1982

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
about 38 years experience i was educated

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,040
northern

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,760
southern ohio kirkland ohio about 20

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,440
miles east of cleveland

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,920
and ohio university down in athens ohio

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,120
my first job after graduating from

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,319
lakeland with a

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,280
mis degree was helping a

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,958
dad's friend code he was about to retire

83
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,599
he didn't want to learn a new language

84
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
and i just

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,119
happened to know or was learning that

86
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,839
language so we helped each other

87
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
moved to columbus in the early 90s since

88
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,879
moving to columbus i've worked for three

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,519
multi-billion dollar companies and

90
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,959
healthcare

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,080
fast food and a utility most of my

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,920
security was learned from an

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
infrastructure group

94
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,518
in a large utility like i said the group

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
was responsible for everything related

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,159
to workstation and mobility products

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,200
i've never worked in a cyber security

98
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
security group

99
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
but i've worked on many cyber security

100
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,359
projects i like to think i know

101
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
what they do from a high level i

102
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
participated in most security projects

103
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,319
involved

104
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
involving workstation security over the

105
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,280
last 30 years patching

106
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,080
antivirus hips pam mac ips

107
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
ids disk encryption certificate

108
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
authority data

109
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
classification event viewer logging

110
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,120
secure ftp

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,400
to policy configurations firewalls uh

112
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,760
proxy servers i probably missed a few i

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,280
i i i don't know all the gory details of

114
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,079
all those processes but i learned enough

115
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,159
about them

116
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
to understand what they do for the most

117
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,519
part

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,599
my next slide has a corneal line on top

119
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,200
um

120
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,798
i've been doing patch management for it

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,119
was a two-word term i started doing

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,760
patch management probably late 90s but

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,440
early 80s i said earlier as a programmer

124
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,560
didn't like it too hard so i didn't

125
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,320
work at it too much mid 80s i went to

126
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,440
ohio university i worked in

127
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
their labs at a pc lab and mac lab i

128
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
went down there

129
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
to get into the business school but my

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
grade point wasn't high enough

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,440
and there was an alternate degree called

132
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,400
the uh there's a bachelor of science in

133
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,600
communication systems management csmt

134
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,799
there's basically a business degree or a

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
telecom degree

136
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
emphasizing business so i learned some

137
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,240
networking to go along with my

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,280
mis degree from lakeland mid late

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,000
90s i in columbus i started off in

140
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,039
computer rooms working the 8pm eight a.m

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
shift

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,720
last uh computer i worked in there was a

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,280
pc in the corner it had

144
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
tivoli af operator on it i started

145
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,039
playing all that and automating a lot of

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
stuff and sending emails and messages

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,520
and

148
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,160
next you know i was working in the pc

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,919
world it was at its infancy at that time

150
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,759
so it was pretty good timing

151
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,520
companies just started adopt computers

152
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,400
uh all the good and bad that came along

153
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,159
with it

154
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,239
um during that time i upgraded some

155
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,520
regional offices for a restaurant chain

156
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,680
from windows 3 1 which was

157
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,599
non-networking to windows 95 which

158
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
required a network so

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,039
we it was a project inventory the

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
systems uh

161
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,520
got the new uh pcs and the network

162
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,639
equipment installed it and

163
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,359
did that over the whole year late 90s up

164
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,520
until now

165
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
um like i said i'm a utility company an

166
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,359
engineering group

167
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,320
and we are responsible for hardware

168
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
software

169
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,479
asset management we evaluate recommend

170
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
test and maintain it

171
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,159
do os provisioning we create the image

172
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,360
it goes on the pcs in our

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,199
enterprise i do patch management uh

174
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,400
other people are grouped to privilege

175
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
access

176
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,679
pam privilege access management

177
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,159
basically removing

178
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,440
admin rights group policy software

179
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,560
delivery

180
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,880
packaging there's a group for mobility

181
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
and all the vdi equivalents of all that

182
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
stuff

183
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
let's see

184
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
so that timing see i just absorbed a lot

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
of uh

186
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,758
cyber security activities uh next slide

187
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,880
um this was at the bottom of the last

188
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
slide that other side was getting a

189
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,600
little busy

190
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
uh it shows the the life cycles i've

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,919
been involved with you can see windows

192
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,680
3.0 to 3-1 you know patching was

193
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,318
ad-hoc it was you know we put all the

194
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,639
patches the image

195
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
pardon me and then patched it once in a

196
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,280
while not too much

197
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,520
when it was mt4 to 2000 i had developed

198
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,919
a process a 30-day process

199
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,560
but most of it was manual did a lot of

200
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,799
scripting

201
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,759
and um database work with recording all

202
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,080
the data

203
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,759
and then around uh you know 2000

204
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
to windows 10 it was a lot more

205
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
automated

206
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,199
you can tell i'm a windows guy microsoft

207
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,440
has kept me employed for

208
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,440
a very long time um

209
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,000
all right so let's move on

210
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,120
ninth okay this is why i started

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,520
patching 1999 8000 pcs across 11 states

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,840
in three

213
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,880
locations when i first started patching

214
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
there was no structure

215
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,159
patches released when the vendor was

216
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,440
ready firewalls

217
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,080
antivirus and patching and some kind of

218
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,759
email scanner passed as security back in

219
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,280
the late 90s

220
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,880
most bad people hadn't figured out what

221
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,440
to do with their skills

222
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,560
and once they did figure out they could

223
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,919
make some money with it

224
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,440
that's when things started to get rough

225
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,280
so i had to make some sense of the whole

226
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,879
mess i had to create some structure i

227
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,039
created a monthly process

228
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,720
that started on the first of every month

229
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,120
for example the patches released from

230
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,199
january 1 to january 31

231
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,360
were used to create a set of patches

232
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,599
that would be deployed after testing

233
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,520
and i called that the patch badge so

234
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,800
january patches were february's patch

235
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,080
match

236
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,039
short story is like i said i wrote

237
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,080
vbscript to interrogate the machines

238
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,400
see if the patches were needed

239
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,840
that were from the patch batch if so

240
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,039
install them recorded

241
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,080
that in the backend database

242
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,479
so it could be rendered in the web page

243
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
they downloaded from vendor the the

244
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
downloads were from a vendor site to a

245
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,958
dfs share

246
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,799
that was had 12 servers geographically

247
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,958
distributed across enterprise for faster

248
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,399
downloads the data like i said was

249
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,880
recorded to back in

250
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,958
sql database and had a web front end so

251
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,040
we can deliver some reports

252
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,719
we had a monthly change control that

253
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,920
documented all our work with different

254
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
tasks from

255
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,519
uh the different people that were

256
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,920
involved there was a large

257
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
contingent of field operations staff

258
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
that did a lot of testing they weren't

259
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,080
really

260
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,279
application testers but they found a lot

261
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,959
of errors

262
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,720
actually when they were doing it they

263
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,719
found most here

264
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
um and they found it because they were

265
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
the ones that are responsible for fixing

266
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,640
them if there was there

267
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,360
so application management wasn't

268
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,360
uh it was terrible there was no software

269
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
development life cycle

270
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
they never retired apps and there was

271
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,519
plenty of different

272
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,600
versions of the same app everywhere our

273
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,120
group oversaw the assets

274
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,279
the tools then were new we weren't

275
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,399
really that good at it to be honest and

276
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,560
you know we did what we could main thing

277
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,560
was i was not allowed to force reboots

278
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,239
for some reason that was just a part of

279
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,479
the culture that

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,399
reboots were frowned upon i guess i

281
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,560
don't know but let's change

282
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,920
so let's move on flash forward to today

283
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
um 19 000 there's probably 20 000 pcs i

284
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,079
haven't updated

285
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
for a while 11 states the locations have

286
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,040
increased

287
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,120
somewhat i am using a patching

288
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,760
compliance module from a

289
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,720
configuration management tool i use the

290
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,600
one from avanti

291
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,680
they're all the same it's a tool do the

292
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,000
evaluations find one that has all the

293
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,760
features you want to use and

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,440
uh use it look for the automation

295
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,360
features a lot of them do have

296
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,839
automation features that can speed

297
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,839
things up

298
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
privilege access management was

299
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
implemented in that time we removed

300
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
admin rights that was big

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,160
inventory was a lot better we got better

302
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,599
using the tools and we

303
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,279
the machines we were in charge of

304
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
getting client we put the clients on the

305
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,040
machine so we

306
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,880
were pretty diligent at that there was

307
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,519
uh we still use change management to

308
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,839
communicate

309
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,200
and document the process uh you can see

310
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,920
there's plenty of difference out there

311
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,519
i'm sure your company has one but it is

312
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,800
automated now so every

313
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,040
i think it's on the eighth of every

314
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,079
month it's automatically created with

315
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,360
a number of different tax tasks with a

316
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,319
number of different groups involved

317
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,399
that's nice because it's all

318
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
consolidated in one place

319
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,440
the there are security groups now that

320
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,959
are have a major influence in patching

321
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
vulnerability management group is the

322
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,880
one i work with a lot the closest with

323
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
and uh the sdlc the software development

324
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,240
life cycle

325
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,519
is it's a little better it's always been

326
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,480
worked on it's one of the hardest things

327
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,160
to get going

328
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,920
but it is one of the things that is

329
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,959
worth improving we'll get into that

330
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,479
later

331
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,800
so i went over these last set of slides

332
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,440
things change and what i've learned over

333
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,959
time

334
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,720
is i like that little transition the

335
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,800
solid patch management process makes

336
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
cyber security easier

337
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,319
i'm not sure if science out was right

338
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
word so i should have said any so i

339
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,000
learned to automate or

340
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:46,320
what do you call it uh animate

341
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,160
so i get any any patch management helps

342
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,839
the gold patch management is to reduce

343
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,680
the attack surface caused by hardware

344
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,440
and software vulnerabilities

345
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,719
your attack surface is increased with

346
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
every vulnerability

347
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
that exists in your environment i found

348
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,240
the easiest and most effective way to

349
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,120
reduce the attack surface is to fix the

350
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,320
vulnerability

351
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,519
that's what patching does the driving

352
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
force behind patch

353
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,760
patching is a risk management decision

354
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,600
based on your company's tolerance

355
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,279
to leaving machines unpatched and

356
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
vulnerable to attack

357
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,720
if you have a low risk tolerance you

358
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
probably want a fast turnaround in

359
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,560
patching if your risk tolerance is

360
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,680
infinite you'll never pass i don't

361
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
recommend that

362
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,439
just means that you're you're higher

363
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,279
higher silence you're not going to pass

364
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,839
patch as fast you got to decide what

365
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,720
solid means like i said it's subjective

366
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,800
so you want

367
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,320
it should your cycle be 15 days 20 days

368
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,000
30 days

369
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,600
should you measure the timing patch can

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,839
you get 90

371
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,040
saturation in a week two weeks three

372
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,079
weeks those are things you have to

373
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,439
decide

374
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:51,680
and uh weigh toward what a solid is

375
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,600
so how do you make patch management

376
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,279
easier and cyber security easier

377
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
there are three things that i'm going to

378
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
focus on today remember that things and

379
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,479
your quotes and that is

380
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,239
software hardware and user managing

381
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,639
these three things goes a long way to

382
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,240
reducing your company's attack surface

383
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,240
most of some of the information may not

384
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
be new what i want to do

385
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,959
is have you look at it from the patching

386
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,279
guys perspective

387
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,439
so patching now to move forward we have

388
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,360
to agree on what patching is and

389
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,639
i like this definition i don't know i

390
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,040
made it up i guess

391
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,240
patching applying fixes enter updates to

392
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,040
technology

393
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
at set intervals to maintain and secure

394
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,839
optimal operation

395
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
uh notice that i did say technology i

396
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,800
know

397
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
it is my job was patching workstations

398
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
but a lot of this

399
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,399
can be applied to just generalized

400
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,319
technology that needs to be updated

401
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,800
and the intervals is what makes it a

402
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
process

403
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,880
so i found this up patching becomes

404
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,479
easier as a variance of things you patch

405
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,800
decrease look at all the things you got

406
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,160
you got to patch the windows os mac os

407
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,040
and apps linux

408
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,519
mobility apps hardware software apps all

409
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,839
the apps for that third-party software

410
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,639
network stuff database stuff storage

411
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,560
stuff

412
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,399
here's my another animation oh my it

413
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,279
does get complicated

414
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,519
and uh and a modern business large and

415
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,519
small with remote locations

416
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,760
and a web presence you know all this

417
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,760
stuff is is there you need to patch it

418
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,000
so this slide this uh one of the color

419
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,720
slides it's pretty obvious

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,240
it's a little abstract um does anybody

421
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,160
know what this stuff has in common

422
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
type it into the chat window there i

423
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,279
should be online

424
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,240
uh these are the related activities

425
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,760
processes and additional things

426
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
that can affect the monthly patch

427
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,600
process i don't think the list is all

428
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,959
encompassing i

429
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
i've been adding it and thinking over

430
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,479
the years but i just added ai

431
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
recently there was a scanner that had

432
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,160
some new

433
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,440
uh artificial intelligence functionality

434
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,279
like a slider and they turned it up a

435
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,800
little too far and it stops on my patch

436
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,000
downloads

437
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,680
i added cloud recently i did see some

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,480
cool stuff on

439
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,760
analytics where they can analyze your

440
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,120
company and come up with a

441
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,560
representative set of test machines that

442
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,000
hits most or all of the applications in

443
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,560
the environment

444
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,040
uh the animals one i thought was

445
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,959
interesting

446
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,319
we have a fiber network that goes down

447
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,359
every once in a while because of

448
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
gunshots

449
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,360
and hunting season if a bird's sitting

450
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:41,839
on a wire sometimes people shoot at it

451
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,839
all right

452
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,120
whether whether is another frequent

453
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,120
interrupter or at work utility if

454
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,720
there's a storm the restoration

455
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,399
uh efforts um they asked me to

456
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,000
carefully monitor the patching during

457
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,759
that time i can

458
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,040
keep the west and east and south and

459
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,320
north separate so it

460
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,920
is a little bit uh easy to do that way i

461
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,720
dns has been on there for a while but

462
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,519
that's been in there for the news

463
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,000
last week i guess we had there was an

464
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,839
emergency patch that uh

465
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,839
had to go out and it went out

466
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,479
that is the end of the first section now

467
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,239
let's talk about the things

468
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,759
these are the things that can have an

469
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,680
impact on patching

470
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
it's not a complete list just the ones i

471
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,880
have time to talk about

472
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,120
remember they can have a negative or

473
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,000
positive effect depending on the size of

474
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
your organization these

475
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,279
activities could be a few people's

476
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
responsibilities or many different

477
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,720
groups responsibilities

478
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,240
many of these points are based off

479
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,959
processes that you may have up and

480
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,279
running

481
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,199
some camping some can be considered

482
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,480
computer hygiene or maintenance

483
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,560
asset management whatever you want to

484
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,279
call it a lot of times this stuff gets

485
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
overlooked

486
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,199
or hasn't been looked at for a while

487
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,720
later on i'll get into more detail

488
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,240
explanation how improvements here

489
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,240
benefit the patching process

490
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,520
all these points are relevant but the

491
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,160
top three four have the greatest ability

492
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,679
to

493
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,120
influence patching those are three i'm

494
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
gonna spend the most time on the last

495
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,079
four i'm just gonna mention

496
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,359
app management at some point in the

497
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,639
future it's

498
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,240
it will be the most critical thing to

499
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,120
manage the virtualization of

500
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,880
applications

501
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,039
will allow apps to be run anywhere on

502
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,799
any platform user management there's a

503
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,199
couple things three things there admin

504
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,280
rights permissions and auditing

505
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
hardware management configuration

506
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
hardware management

507
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,039
some of the important things are

508
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,480
configuration management and risk

509
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,440
classification

510
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,320
network uh condition network condition

511
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,840
matters

512
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,399
and you get pretty expensive to try to

513
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,799
keep up with uh user demand

514
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
security products creative products can

515
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,840
cause patching to stop think about it

516
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,280
patching acts like what security

517
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,600
products look for

518
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
it hits a machine downloads a package

519
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,959
exe or msi

520
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,320
executes the downloads reports back to

521
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
command and control

522
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,439
if those products aren't configured

523
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
correctly security software stops

524
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,160
patching

525
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,440
to some degree enterprise culture and

526
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,640
c-level buy-in

527
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,960
are a little more uh abstract

528
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,880
but well worth the effort since uh

529
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,880
culture directly deals with the end user

530
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,159
all right so this is it managing

531
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,159
applications standardized standardized

532
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,320
standardized it's all about the apps

533
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,240
get to know application support and

534
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,799
development people

535
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,160
apps are what business businesses run on

536
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,639
it's all about the apps as

537
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,640
virtualization takes over app management

538
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
is going to be even more important

539
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
at some point in the future we'll all be

540
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,440
supporting apps in one way or another

541
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,160
the hardware layer won't be a

542
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,000
consideration as much as it is today

543
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,440
people get to work on whatever device

544
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,760
they're comfortable with

545
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,720
and virtualization plays a hard key role

546
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,200
in that

547
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,760
so with applications a software having a

548
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
software

549
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
development life cycle is a must

550
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,919
application lifecycle called what you

551
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,799
want

552
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,960
is about manager applications and

553
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,918
keeping production versions consistent

554
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,160
and retiring old applications if i could

555
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,919
work at a place that used one app

556
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,200
think about it the attack surface is

557
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,840
reduced you don't have three different

558
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,520
versions

559
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,000
of a pdf reader uh testing takes less

560
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
time

561
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
all the different configurations that

562
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,840
you should test it on but

563
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,320
time permitting you do the best you can

564
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,360
number patches is smaller so

565
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,360
burden on the network is reduced having

566
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,879
a formal support and testing structure

567
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,320
in place for every piece of software is

568
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,960
critical know who supports what

569
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,678
hours of time can be wasted looking for

570
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,720
who supports the broken app

571
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,039
the disk data and risk classification

572
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,640
apply a risk score to software products

573
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,280
it's nice to know what applications are

574
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,520
critical for operating the business

575
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,559
that can help prioritize what to patch

576
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,039
or maybe uh

577
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,320
creating a special group for those

578
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,280
critical apps

579
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,480
could be a process you undertake to

580
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,639
isolate them and make sure they get

581
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,960
patched in more time and manner

582
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,440
assigning risk we talked about that who

583
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,440
accessed what app and when that's

584
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,679
identity and access management i'm using

585
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,960
it as a general term

586
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,480
it's powerful tools used to control and

587
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,240
unlock access i firm believe you're in

588
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,919
least privileged principle only give

589
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,320
them

590
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,080
access to what they need especially for

591
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,720
process ids

592
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,639
all this information that im gathers is

593
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,559
help for doing treble resolution

594
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,840
and to keep an eye on what users are

595
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,440
doing especially

596
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,120
if they have admin rights or you have to

597
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,120
do some for forensics on a

598
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,158
machine that's been compromised

599
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,000
configuration management database

600
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
that stuff's important let's you know uh

601
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,200
software usage if they're not using it

602
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
uh take it away sometimes license

603
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,000
software can get pretty expensive and

604
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,400
people use it you can manage it through

605
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,440
that those methods so managing software

606
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,039
helps with testing

607
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,039
deployment and network usage

608
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,640
the user the two main points here admin

609
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,760
rights

610
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,520
and iam again understand the difference

611
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,960
between admiration permissions

612
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,720
think of it like this you can be an

613
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,679
admin on a machine but you still need

614
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,400
permission

615
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,760
to access applications and depending on

616
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,080
who you ask

617
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,520
removing admin rights stops up about 95

618
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,520
percent of malware

619
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,158
i think that's a little bit high but uh

620
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,879
it's just a figure admin rights allow

621
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,400
the user

622
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,200
or the hacker to do anything they want

623
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,720
in the system make it easy to give in

624
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,240
remove admin rights you don't want

625
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,840
someone who has just fired your admin

626
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,080
rights for a very long time

627
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,280
especially if they're disgruntled

628
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,000
evidence of what

629
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,918
hackers and malware are after when

630
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,240
malware is run with admin rights

631
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,240
inherited from a logged in user or

632
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,320
elevated through a vulnerability

633
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,360
the malware hacker can do anything to

634
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,120
that machine

635
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,959
and depending on the network access of

636
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,039
the uh right cigarette

637
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,000
it may make it much easier to move

638
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,000
laterally through your network

639
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,760
if possible only supply admin rights

640
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,480
when needed the principal at least

641
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,919
privilege again

642
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
and you could even take it further to

643
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,120
the zero trust framework where nothing

644
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,720
is trusted

645
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,158
that's a pretty simple simplified

646
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,000
explanation of it but

647
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,520
the privilege of lease principle and

648
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,440
zero trust frameworks

649
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,120
uh take additional effort but they're

650
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
they're they might go outside of

651
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,039
patch management they're well worth the

652
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,360
effort

653
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,200
mobility remember mobility that's a

654
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,039
whole nother aspect of patching all the

655
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,760
different mobility products out there

656
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,559
and

657
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,960
the access the user has and what rights

658
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,960
they have

659
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,439
some regulatory requirements require a

660
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,439
business unit in a regular area

661
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,199
have they cannot talk to each other we

662
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,240
there's one in our area where we have an

663
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,360
unregulated

664
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,360
sign that can't talk to a regulated side

665
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,639
so regulatory requirements are in

666
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,240
consideration

667
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,919
when it comes to users the hardware

668
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,840
again standardized standardized

669
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,360
standardized you need to understand what

670
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,439
you're up against by having an accurate

671
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,399
inventory of unique models and systems

672
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,559
on the network

673
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,120
each model usually has its own driver

674
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,559
set bios updates chipsets buses network

675
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,719
adapters

676
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,840
uh wired wi-fi you get the point

677
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
remember the variance of things

678
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,320
principle

679
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,080
the more models running on the network

680
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,559
the more effort required to do that to

681
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,158
test

682
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,240
and patch and track all the different

683
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,200
vulnerabilities so standardization helps

684
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
reduce

685
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,640
the workloads standardized that's one

686
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,918
thing i tell you about hardware

687
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,480
don't have three different vendors

688
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,600
minimize the choices it helps reduce the

689
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,720
attack surface why

690
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,760
have microsoft or ibm

691
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,559
and lenovo and there all that different

692
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,879
choices

693
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,158
require a lot more testing a lot more

694
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,320
patching

695
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,200
just like a life cycle is crucial for

696
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,360
software

697
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,679
have a hardware life cycle it's just as

698
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,000
important helps keep old and sometimes

699
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,080
unsupported hardware off the network how

700
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,400
many years you should wait between the

701
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,480
refresh is a risk management decision

702
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,320
once you decide that should you forklift

703
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,880
do it all at once do have a rolling life

704
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,918
cycle do 25 percent of your machines

705
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,559
every

706
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,080
every every year uh that's something you

707
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,158
need to decide

708
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,520
um audit audit activities on the asset

709
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,480
usually through event logs or you can

710
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,799
use third-party software to do that

711
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,919
a big one here is assigning a risk score

712
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,639
based on data for

713
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,000
data classification risk scores are

714
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,520
determined by the apps running on the

715
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,559
server or what kind of data is on the

716
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,158
database

717
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,840
helps you decide which ones to monitor

718
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,200
more closely and helps determining your

719
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,678
patching schedule

720
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,279
usually putting the critical ones first

721
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,880
vendor relations has been in the news

722
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,200
lately

723
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,159
as a possible attack vendor many vendors

724
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,480
attack vector

725
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,919
many vendors want access to their linux

726
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,039
security appliances or

727
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,679
non-linux security appliances verify

728
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,200
um who they are and and look at their

729
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
security posture before you let them on

730
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,919
your network

731
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,360
uh again some some regulations require

732
00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,559
systems being locked cages uh we have a

733
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,120
regular retirement from nerc which is a

734
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,559
regulator electrical industry where

735
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,320
these critical assets have to be in a

736
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,000
physically locked cage

737
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,120
so there's a lot of considerations in

738
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,880
that area too for hardware

739
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,559
we'll touch upon the network these uh we

740
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,760
hit on the first three spin a little

741
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,760
detail on those

742
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,000
these last one i'm going to touch upon

743
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,840
network condition matters

744
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,120
no condition can have a major impact on

745
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,120
success or failure

746
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,039
and is usually out of your control it's

747
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,719
usually related to patchy downloads or

748
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,200
port closures

749
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,200
get to know the people who run the

750
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,080
network have a good friend at your

751
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,799
24 7 knock or sock whatever you want to

752
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,158
call it

753
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,120
make sure you can have someone to call

754
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,760
when when you come across some

755
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,719
network issues have a formalized process

756
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,640
in place

757
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,480
for issue reporting escalation and

758
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,279
resolution if needed

759
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,799
uh have a police anatom analogy you

760
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,240
could call a swat and get all the

761
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,918
interested people together

762
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,360
to come to some trouble resolution

763
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,360
you should know all your ingress and

764
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,918
egos points and how data flows through

765
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,439
them

766
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,120
the vpn connection has been in the

767
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,159
spotlight with all of us working from

768
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,799
home lately

769
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,240
it also has hampered my ability to query

770
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,440
for accurate patch groups

771
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,000
because there's not a lot of whole

772
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,000
information on iron that comes through

773
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,320
that can distinguish the vpn user and

774
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,320
where they are

775
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,918
make sure the network can handle the

776
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,439
traffic

777
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,200
i think every network has slow links

778
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,640
know where they are

779
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
when you're patching if you have a big

780
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,360
patch batch that could

781
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,120
hamper network performance or getting

782
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,520
the patches and machines

783
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,719
you can have 24 hour baselines

784
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,039
determined

785
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,240
to see where bandwidth is available or

786
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,840
how it's used

787
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,320
and then monitor those deviations from

788
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,559
baselines to know where you can patch

789
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,240
understand when network bandwidth is

790
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,879
available and not available

791
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,559
remote locations can have low bandwidth

792
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,559
that do cause some patching issues

793
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,760
um i didn't know where to put this slide

794
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,120
i talked about regulations and

795
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
frameworks for a while

796
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,199
these are some of the regulatory

797
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,840
standards and industrial frameworks

798
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,520
that are out there regular regulatory

799
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,279
standards or requirements you must meet

800
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,200
your work in certain industries

801
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,520
and frameworks are standards you choose

802
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,840
to implement for example this has a good

803
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,039
patch management framework that you can

804
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,760
follow

805
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,520
any company you follow whereas hipaa has

806
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,120
regulatory requirements if you're in the

807
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,840
medical industry that you have to abide

808
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,279
by

809
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,039
i tell you truth i don't know what all

810
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,360
those mean uh

811
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,039
but my point here is that if you're in

812
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,039
industry know what the regular

813
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,399
requirements are because they can be

814
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,399
very time consuming to meet

815
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,440
security products know their processes

816
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,918
and understand their protocols the key

817
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,279
is to

818
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,840
have process and people in place for

819
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:55,039
quick and easy collaboration escalation

820
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,559
and a resolution all this security stuff

821
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,200
can affect patching

822
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,039
when i say protocols i mean the actual

823
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,279
practices and procedures and who

824
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,360
leads them and it's also nice to know

825
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,720
what what protocols different software

826
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,520
uses and what different

827
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,440
security products use and knowing the

828
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,559
ports just helps in general and

829
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,080
if you're going to be a patch person

830
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,918
the key is to knowing what these

831
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,600
products do and what kind of effects

832
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,279
they can have in patching

833
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,120
and most importantly make sure you have

834
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,360
a contact point for every security

835
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,959
product in your environment

836
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,360
the next slide might tie live stream

837
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,120
together software hardware

838
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,000
user security and how it's all

839
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,000
interrelated

840
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
i might be getting a little outside

841
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,880
patch management here but all this stuff

842
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,320
but i put all this

843
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,919
on one slide to show there is some

844
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,279
overlapping hardware and software and

845
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,279
some of the processes

846
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,520
and to show that it all runs on the

847
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,360
network and being aware of this

848
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,158
being aware of all this helps me to

849
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,559
patch get to know the software hardware

850
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,760
users and networks used to access and

851
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,158
protect data

852
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,600
as a patch person you're exposed to all

853
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,679
groups in the company

854
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,760
you reach out and touch every pc every

855
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,360
month i've learned that patching is the

856
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,679
first thing everyone looks at when there

857
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,719
is an

858
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,960
issue i'm assuming many now

859
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,080
i'm assigned many non-patching trouble

860
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,919
tickets so

861
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,279
understand the basics of all this help

862
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,919
you perform the job

863
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,679
it also helps you to know who you can

864
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,880
reassign tickets to when

865
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,320
one is erroneously routed to you get to

866
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,159
know the computing environment

867
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,439
get to know how it works especially

868
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,559
security products

869
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,279
and processes eventually at some point

870
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,080
uh if you're patching you'll run into

871
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,480
some issues

872
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
with them

873
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,840
okay these um i'm just going to touch

874
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,120
upon these last three i feel like a

875
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,639
short change them

876
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,799
uh they're a little more abstract than

877
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,320
the first three three and a half

878
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,559
with half of the networking i include

879
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,080
that the higher on the org chart the

880
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,799
message comes from the greater

881
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,799
probability of success people seem to

882
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,000
listen to c-level executives

883
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,918
the higher on the merge chart the

884
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,279
message comes from the more likely

885
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,799
employees will listen

886
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,120
i have two males about an upcoming

887
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,200
security event one from us from the

888
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,639
admin that is performing the work the

889
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,880
other from the ceo

890
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,320
which one is read more i'll put my money

891
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,640
on the cdl note

892
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,080
um cyber security is discussed at many

893
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,919
board meetings now

894
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,158
it used to be pretty hard to get time

895
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,799
for security at the at that level

896
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,279
that's changing uh cost thanks to the

897
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,960
cost of rising breaches

898
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,039
people are still the weakest link make

899
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,840
sure patching is talked about

900
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,480
encouraged and rewarded this is about

901
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,799
culture

902
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,720
train your people they are usually the

903
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,840
weakest link and will probably always be

904
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,000
the weakest link

905
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,520
teach them about security even a basic

906
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
online course can help

907
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,760
and making it mandatory might help them

908
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,080
understand the importance of patching

909
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,360
or some or even some companies are

910
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,559
making cyber security

911
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,840
a criteria in their bonus structure

912
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,039
it is very serious uh let them know what

913
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,678
you're doing and

914
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,720
and when you're doing it make patching a

915
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,720
habit tell people why it's so important

916
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,880
and and telling them why it's so

917
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,559
important can make them care

918
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,159
having a monthly calendar available for

919
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,480
end users to check uh

920
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,760
patching and security events is a step

921
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,320
toward that end

922
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,799
uh make it easy to report issues the

923
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
easier

924
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,600
it is to report issues the faster you

925
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,600
can resolve them

926
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,880
done with the second section let's talk

927
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:32,240
about the process

928
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,799
i like that transition i started

929
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,559
patching

930
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,559
i thought 30-day cycle would be plenty

931
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,639
of time to download tests and deploy

932
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,120
patches to the environment

933
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,799
it still is a 30-day cycle but it's

934
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,439
instead of starting on the first of the

935
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,279
month

936
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,039
today the starting date for each month

937
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,720
is patch tuesday

938
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,200
microsoft started labeling the second

939
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,880
tuesday of each month patch tuesday

940
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,600
this is the date that they released most

941
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,600
of their patches

942
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,000
many other software vendors also post

943
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,039
their patches on that date as well i'm

944
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,880
not going to

945
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,399
go over all the details of the process

946
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,600
i'll hit a few important ones along the

947
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,840
way

948
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,240
i will have a bunch of bullets in my

949
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,360
notes when i post this

950
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,559
presentation you can look at those

951
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,600
um throughout the

952
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,279
process communication is important we

953
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,199
talked about it here and there but

954
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,120
good communication about what is going

955
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,760
on cannot be neglected

956
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,918
with that in mind these are the things i

957
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,799
do to inform and document what happens

958
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,320
every month

959
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,080
we may touch on these a little earlier

960
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,120
but this little more detail change

961
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,799
management

962
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,959
one monthly master change with

963
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,918
assignable tasks to detail all the

964
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,000
activities from all the groups involved

965
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,000
that can be automated

966
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
it is automatically working it is worth

967
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,799
automating uh the workflows a lot of the

968
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,320
new

969
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,679
uh service now and uh

970
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,960
a couple i don't remember the other ones

971
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,640
names but they all have workflow

972
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,240
automation you can use

973
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,480
the monthly email released on the first

974
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,960
day of patch psycho with links to

975
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,279
patching details and resources

976
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,399
on patrick tuesday or shortly after an

977
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,039
email was sent to

978
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,518
itunes managers app support managers app

979
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,600
people help desk security groups and

980
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,200
business unit contacts that email

981
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,840
provides details

982
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,039
on testing timeline patches to be

983
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,199
deployed

984
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:26,320
the schedule who to call with issues

985
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,559
formalized communication between uh

986
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,559
from formalized communication channels

987
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,480
between all groups involved

988
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,918
engineering help desk app support

989
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,159
network and security

990
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,960
over the years i found it beneficial to

991
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,039
know the

992
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,880
other players that the patching process

993
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,039
can cause work for

994
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,120
for example if there is an issue the

995
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,039
help desk gets inundated with uh

996
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,639
calls the patching website

997
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,320
we've been over a little bit it has the

998
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,080
deployment schedule and links to the

999
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,080
change control and

1000
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:01,678
uh schedule with issues

1001
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,799
um announce testing in patching schedule

1002
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,640
and cab meeting

1003
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,360
cab meeting is a change advisory board

1004
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,839
meeting a lot of companies have a

1005
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,440
daily one that if you have a change

1006
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,159
coming up for that day or the next few

1007
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,918
days

1008
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,599
you announce it we do that regularly

1009
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,679
with a patching

1010
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,520
workstation server and whatever any

1011
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,839
other group that does do

1012
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,839
patching

1013
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,359
during this testing period robust test

1014
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,079
environment is important

1015
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,159
i generally provide about eight working

1016
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,159
days for patch testing

1017
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,200
but let me say if it's a if there is an

1018
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,119
emergency emergency deployment declared

1019
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,879
because of active code exploiting a

1020
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,720
zero-day vulnerability

1021
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,480
the testing window could be reduced to

1022
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,719
zero usually about

1023
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,280
three days is what we test on with it

1024
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,279
zero day

1025
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,359
testing is critical the purpose of

1026
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,839
testing is to find and fix

1027
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,680
issues in the small test groups prior to

1028
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,839
deploying them to the enterprise

1029
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,078
the time it takes to test has a direct

1030
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,640
correlation to the variety of things in

1031
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,280
things to test so remember that less

1032
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,520
variety

1033
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,320
less time as variety goes up so does

1034
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,000
testing time

1035
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,079
as the models of hardware and versions

1036
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,160
of software running in your environment

1037
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,280
increase so does the complexity and time

1038
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,520
to test

1039
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,720
ideally you should test all versions of

1040
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,640
all software

1041
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,160
on all hardware models but that is not

1042
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,400
practical

1043
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,160
you make your best effort to test the

1044
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,200
most prevalent configurations in your

1045
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,118
environment

1046
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,480
and be ready for uh unexpected

1047
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,800
remediations

1048
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,320
for instance you could have a task in

1049
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,160
the change management

1050
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,480
that you can enter all the issues into

1051
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,879
and if like the one we use i can follow

1052
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,800
it anytime anybody adds anything to the

1053
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,960
to that task i get an email

1054
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,960
you can never have enough uh application

1055
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,040
and patch testers make it easy

1056
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,079
to join and leave the patch testing

1057
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,400
groups

1058
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,920
i have a query for an 80 group that is

1059
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,640
for patch testers and if you're in that

1060
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,400
group

1061
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,560
you're a tester it makes it really easy

1062
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,560
to

1063
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,839
keep track of the page testers

1064
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,599
it's critical to test all the

1065
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,960
functionality of an application after

1066
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,280
patching

1067
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,560
it's not that hard you'll launch the app

1068
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,560
sign in if necessary

1069
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,599
use the app and report the issues and

1070
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,759
that can all be automated

1071
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,520
if some groups don't have a testing

1072
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,040
environment you can provide a testing

1073
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,160
environment

1074
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,040
is there is some cost to it and time and

1075
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,279
money to set up a virtual workstation

1076
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,119
a certain workstations that testers can

1077
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,359
use with the different flavors and

1078
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,960
operating systems and stuff so uh it

1079
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,240
might be worth setting it up

1080
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,079
for some critical apps that don't have

1081
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,078
that kind of testing environment

1082
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,760
again now we're going to deployment

1083
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,240
remember it's important to tell the

1084
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,720
people

1085
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,560
what you're doing and hey people i'm

1086
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,399
about to bake your pc

1087
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,279
um if there's a patching problem you can

1088
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,720
hear about it

1089
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,880
like i said it's pretty obvious

1090
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,959
it comes in big groups if there's an

1091
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,599
issue that didn't get caught in testing

1092
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,520
it

1093
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,760
the help desk gets inundated and i get

1094
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,759
called

1095
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,078
the deployment is a stage deployment

1096
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,720
with small batch of assets

1097
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,480
that i add to and get bigger and bigger

1098
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,319
it starts on the last day

1099
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,160
and the testing day ends on the next

1100
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,320
month's deployment start date

1101
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,960
i start by turning the tasks i use for

1102
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,040
testing into the production test

1103
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,800
and try to try to keep those number of

1104
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,640
groups down to a minimum

1105
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,720
if you have too many groups the queries

1106
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,359
get hard to manage

1107
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,720
you get tend to get a few machines in a

1108
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,839
lot of different groups so

1109
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,720
it's like you say one thing keep your

1110
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,720
groups to a minimum

1111
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,560
it's much easier to patch one group than

1112
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,839
managing all the

1113
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,759
like let's say 10 groups you got to

1114
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,560
manage that scheduling queries some

1115
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,599
remember keep those views to a minimum

1116
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,640
monitor your console and help desk calls

1117
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,680
i found that once the word is out about

1118
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,200
patching a lot of the issues

1119
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,799
that are out there become patching

1120
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,319
issues so if you get a ticket you can

1121
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,359
spot check that machine and see if it

1122
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,000
got patched

1123
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,160
you can cross-reference the the machines

1124
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,320
that were patched that day

1125
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,598
to the issues coming in and if you if

1126
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,480
you see something like that that could

1127
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,599
help

1128
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:28,320
um have a remediation plan to handle

1129
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,320
handle the issues that you find um

1130
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,000
that would help in the long run to

1131
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,720
get all the groups involved and who to

1132
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,720
call and stuff

1133
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,480
uh one of the important things i found

1134
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,599
out you need is rebooting

1135
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,079
and sometimes that bothers people make

1136
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,520
sure you

1137
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,440
control and configure the reboots

1138
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,000
having the ability to set parameters is

1139
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,280
important most of the patching tools do

1140
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,240
have the ability to

1141
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,200
set configuration like time to time it

1142
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,399
can reboot when it can't reboot

1143
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,160
if you don't make people reboot

1144
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,400
a certain percentage won't and they will

1145
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,399
complain when you force them

1146
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,839
if you use as admin right they can stop

1147
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,240
patching completely so remember it's

1148
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,078
important to remove admin rights

1149
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,520
some patches are not installed until the

1150
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,839
system is rebooted

1151
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,400
attack surface is not reduced when a

1152
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,960
system sits in a pending agreement state

1153
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,200
and the machine is left sitting in an

1154
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,079
unstable state

1155
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,040
appointment they should uh what's the

1156
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,480
next one

1157
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,160
there should be a way to mark machines

1158
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,520
as do not reboot

1159
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,040
so in this case if you have a machine

1160
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,720
you can't reboot make sure they fill out

1161
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,839
risk exception i don't know we talked

1162
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,399
about that yet

1163
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,279
um but it should be filled out by the

1164
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,359
party that is requesting the stoppage

1165
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,720
no matter how hard you try someone's

1166
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,759
always going to have an asset that can't

1167
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,520
be rebooted

1168
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,119
have them fill out a form the risk

1169
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,200
exemption form info

1170
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,480
should include the name contact the

1171
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,520
asset name

1172
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,920
how long will the stoppage be are there

1173
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,560
mitigating circumstances in place

1174
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,200
of the patch all that stuff is pretty

1175
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,319
important

1176
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,200
to know make sure

1177
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,359
your people know the difference between

1178
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,240
reboot and log off

1179
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,279
sometimes you can set a job up you want

1180
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,598
to set a job up

1181
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,880
to work when no one's logged in

1182
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,800
and people don't know the difference

1183
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,520
between logging off and

1184
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,200
rebooting or signing out you can run

1185
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,480
into some issues

1186
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,359
um again i'll go to the bottom one

1187
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,680
clearing out

1188
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,720
memory intent files reboots help with

1189
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,680
that it keeps the machine running better

1190
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,520
let's move on after the deployment post

1191
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,319
deployment by this time

1192
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,520
you're also doing some pre-work for the

1193
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,759
next cycle

1194
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,640
so compare your stats with the security

1195
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,920
groups

1196
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,799
um installs failed installs machines

1197
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,119
missing patches

1198
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,440
etc i usually work with the security

1199
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,920
group to see if our sets match

1200
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,000
verify patches did indeed install this

1201
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,000
is where you can spot check bigger

1202
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,359
groups of machine just to validate the

1203
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,599
installs

1204
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,119
check your geographic footprint just to

1205
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,960
make sure

1206
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,720
investigate and remediate fail

1207
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,760
investigate and remediate failed

1208
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,680
installs

1209
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,760
investigating or meeting failed installs

1210
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,520
is very time consuming

1211
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,800
you could get lucky and find a trend

1212
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,599
where you know you

1213
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,880
you know you patch location x and you

1214
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,599
see all those

1215
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,800
office versions are broke in that office

1216
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,240
um

1217
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,319
that would be pretty obvious but a lot

1218
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,000
of times they're one-off machines and

1219
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,599
it does take a lot of time to remediate

1220
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,240
them

1221
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,359
complete and uh close your change

1222
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,598
control

1223
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,279
uh closing monthly change control and

1224
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,720
verifying all support documents are

1225
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,400
attached is important

1226
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,959
a lot of times that information can be

1227
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,440
used for audit purposes

1228
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,640
or is used for auto purposes so this

1229
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,240
last slide let's tie it all together

1230
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,319
let's slide this little dizzy in there

1231
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,759
so wrap it up imagining the big three

1232
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,040
will go a long way in reducing the

1233
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,960
attack surface

1234
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,960
patching becomes easier as your attack

1235
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,960
surface decreases

1236
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,280
the application standardized application

1237
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,040
life cycle process help set

1238
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,880
only the latest versions of all apps

1239
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,040
should be in production

1240
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,560
eliminate duplicate apps like some

1241
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,920
office is a prime example don't have

1242
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,279
office

1243
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,640
16 19 and 10 classified for criticality

1244
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,520
helps you determine

1245
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,400
uh what to patch first only give access

1246
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,079
to people who

1247
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,640
use the app but if they don't use it

1248
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,560
take it away hardware is standardized

1249
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,920
keep model choices to a minimum and

1250
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,400
audit usage

1251
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,599
lifecycle is is critical for keeping

1252
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,720
unsupported

1253
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,280
hardware off your network users

1254
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,040
remove admin rights control or at least

1255
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,000
monitor usage for critical apps and

1256
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,040
hardware for

1257
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,040
future forensic investigations or audits

1258
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,560
getting these basics in order makes

1259
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,200
patching easier

1260
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,400
mainly by reducing attack surface

1261
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,839
network usage

1262
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,839
and the time it takes to patch

1263
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,920
and i oh i did include uh some visual

1264
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,078
another color slide this is just a

1265
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,720
swimlane chart you can go through these

1266
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,760
that you want it basically says all of

1267
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,040
what i said

1268
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,280
in a visual form to some extent uh this

1269
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,960
is

1270
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,040
i like that is my one of my favorite

1271
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,560
transitions this is another

1272
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,480
timeline thing where it shows where

1273
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,160
everything overlaps

1274
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,520
and um i think we have time for some

1275
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,399
questions so

1276
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,359
that was the end and thanks for

1277
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,359
listening
