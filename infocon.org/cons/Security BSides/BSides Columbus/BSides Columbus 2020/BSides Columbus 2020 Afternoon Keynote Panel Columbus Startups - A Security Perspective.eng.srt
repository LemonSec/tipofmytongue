to

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,319

a long time

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
sorts of different organizations and we

118
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,758
kind of

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
used to poke poke at each other between

120
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,840
startup life

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,720
and different sorts of professional life

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,679
and after having such a tenured career

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
brendan

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,400
decided to be the first security person

125
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,520
at root insurance route insurance is

126
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,638
a well fast growing

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,919
tech startup here in columbus ohio

128
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,000
and they are a unicorn in startup land

129
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,719
that means valued at a billion dollars

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,919
or more

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,120

132
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,240
while brendan's experience as the first

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
standalone startup to a corporate

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,479
organization

175
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,159
and the last two years i spent at virgiv

176
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,318
kind of doing the opposite

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
where virtiv spun out of emerson and

178
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,120
became a startup

179
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,720
and so i think it'll be interesting as

180
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
we're talking to see just the different

181
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,840
perspectives on

182
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,359
kind of that same journey in both sides

183
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,679
of it

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
that 100 years of experience coming out

185
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,840
i'm going to keep that going yes we're

186
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,840
old we get it

187
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,680
well in a startup things are often

188
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,759
greenfield

189
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,360
what that means it's a black slate you

190
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,000
can do what you want right uh

191
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,520
what are some opportunities or thoughts

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,039
on building

193
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,039
new security programs or solutions in a

194
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,318
startup would you kick us off

195
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,318
with your thoughts on that question

196
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,960
please brendan

197
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
oh absolutely um you're right it is

198
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
entirely greenfield

199
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
that was one of the things that really

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,560
attracted me to working for startup

201
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,080
i was thrilled with the idea of being

202
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,840
able to get in and

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,599
just build it like you said building

204
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
security programs something you've done

205
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,680
before

206
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,360
it was fantastic one of the things

207
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
i'll tell you you're asking for lessons

208
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,479
learned or things that i did

209
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,318
one of the things that i took advantage

210
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,880
of in the green field

211
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
was to try to avoid point project point

212
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
products

213
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,039
since i had greenfield i decided that i

214
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,199
didn't want to have

215
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,240
30 vendors i'd rather have three or four

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,680
or five

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
and that was a great experience just

218
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,039
trying to find vendors that hit

219
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,319
multiple problems and did it well

220
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,680
and then work with them from the

221
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,840
beginning to build the security program

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,919
and the kind of vendors that work well

223
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,119
with a young company or a more

224
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,198
innovative company

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,879
are often fundamentally different than

226
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,960
the kind of companies you see

227
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,319
the logos you see in the these big

228
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,520
corporations

229
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,000
in our city around us do you have

230
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,960
any thoughts you'd had on greenfield

231
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
environments

232
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
they're just

233
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,080
um yeah i think one of the

234
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,639
interesting challenges that we face with

235
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,280
smaller security programs is adapting to

236
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,399
the business i

237
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,799
enterprise security is largely

238
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,719
in some ways very aesthetic you know

239
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,279
you've got this large-scale problem and

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,200
you

241
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,799
know most organizations build piles of

242
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,720
bureaucracy to

243
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:47,439
work around it especially as a startup

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,279
or a smaller organization you your

245
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,120
biggest strength is your agility your

246
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,800
ability to adapt to change and the

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
security program

248
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,560
needs to kind of lean into that to some

249
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,160
degree in order to ensure the business

250
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,079
is successful

251
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,319
the way that i've historically

252
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,279
approached it is i tend to take a very

253
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
risk-based approach let's understand

254
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,519
what the

255
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,959
risk is and articulate that to the

256
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
business and

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,920
work with the business to figure out how

258
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,720
best we can mitigate that risk the

259
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,240
bang for your buck as it were seems to

260
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,440
give us the best approach

261
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,839
and allows us to continue to modify and

262
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,920
continue that conversation as that risk

263
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,839
changes as the organization grows and

264
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,000
changes

265
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,839
i love that jesse how can you support or

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,440
enable the business

267
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
that's something that's so often

268
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,800
medicine and security teams

269
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,359
these days and well and

270
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,040
corporations are bigger companies

271
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
sometimes we still get away with that

272
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,800
right

273
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,760
the department of no uh is slowing down

274
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,479
the business

275
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,000
in a startup very young company and you

276
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,880
slow down the business

277
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,480
you probably won't be there very long so

278
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,279
it's a really

279
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,399
different a situation called truly but

280
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,439
it's also

281
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
an opportunity too an opportunity to

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
innovate

283
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,760
because you're not stuck with piles of

284
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,000
legacy craft

285
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,079
can you tell us about some unique

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,800
opportunities where you've had to

287
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,439
innovate in security and your broad and

288
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,319
diverse background shot

289
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,440
oh innovation yeah um just about every

290
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,920
organization it's funny

291
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
we're focused on talking about the

292
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,439
startup lifecycle

293
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,640
style but you know it's funny you know

294
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,320
again playing on the

295
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,079
2 000 years of experience or whatever we

296
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,040
have on the panel um

297
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,079
now he's calling us old well i think i

298
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,279
get it on the game

299
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,000
uh the the thing i've seen in my career

300
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,079
is that security has gone from a

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
checklist kind of function

302
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,399
to a storytelling function right the

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,200
most effective security programs

304
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,800
understand how to translate you know

305
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
what does the business care about to

306
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,160
what is the

307
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,800
technology need to deliver and you know

308
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,240
so

309
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,000
what i've seen a lot of times when it

310
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,959
comes to innovation is people finally

311
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,640
learning

312
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,160
that you can't just walk in and spout

313
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
off a bunch of tools

314
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,920
and expect people on the other side of

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
the table to give you the money for them

316
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,160
um and especially in startup plans right

317
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,640
where there isn't a huge bucket of money

318
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
to

319
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,560
spend on things that don't drive the

320
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,519
profitability or the bottom line of that

321
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,439
company in its critical stages of growth

322
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,040
uh coming into a new company that's only

323
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
in the startup and saying i want to go

324
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640
out and

325
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,239
you know buy you know qradar for

326
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,079
instance right this huge

327
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,000
very very versatile sim package

328
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,599
you're going to drop a price tag on the

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,680
on your founders and they're probably

330
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,399
going to look at you like you have seven

331
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,000
seven eyes right it's and they're gonna

332
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,279
go what is this gonna do to make us more

333
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
profitable and if you don't

334
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,360
adapt to that quickly um that's a very

335
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,639
different change from being in the

336
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,880
enterprise world where

337
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,240
i have a 1.2 million dollar security

338
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,720
budget this year what

339
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
widget do i want to buy um and that

340
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
mentality

341
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,120
hopefully is also changing in the

342
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
corporate world and i have seen a change

343
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
away from that

344
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,480
kind of mindset so that's where i see

345
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,240
the biggest innovation is is learning to

346
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,160
be better communicators and to better

347
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,839
understand what our companies do

348
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,040
because that's what a startup can teach

349
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,480
you better than anybody else

350
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,319
yeah i love that because that's

351
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
ultimately what a startup's doing right

352
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
and that's

353
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,719
entrepreneurship it's solving a problem

354
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,199
that uh companies or people care enough

355
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,000
about

356
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,600
to pay you to solve it for them you're

357
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
not solving their problem you're not

358
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
making money and you won't be around

359
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,720
much longer

360
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,720
thoughts on a security innovation jesse

361
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,959
um i definitely agree with sean there

362
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,839
it is very interesting now being on the

363
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,439
other end of that

364
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,320
and one of the more recent challenges

365
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
that i've had to

366
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,320
embrace is helping one of the largest

367
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
organizations

368
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,040
in the world understand that difference

369
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,279
is okay

370
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,319
and give them that confidence and that

371
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,279
transparency

372
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,240
to move forward because at this point

373
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,720
it's not

374
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,639
you know the scrappy startup with the

375
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,240
small founder who's accountable for the

376
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,560
risk that we take on

377
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,880
it's somebody far removed from the

378
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,000
program at some sea level

379
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,639
it ultimately is and they want

380
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,720
things like data and that's totally

381
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
understandable and acceptable

382
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
and so we've had to kind of build a

383
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,519
little bit of

384
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:39,519
process that didn't have before and that

385
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,920
comes with its own fun as especially

386
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
those who knew the place before start to

387
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,959
grump about well it's not the way it

388
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,199
used to be and helping them

389
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,199
understand why it's important and why it

390
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,880
matters

391
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,560
so i guess that i guess that's my my

392
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,279
takeaway my biggest note is

393
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,560
the uh helping to understand the seek

394
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,880
seek to why isn't just

395
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,839
at the top level it's also sometimes at

396
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,320
the bottom

397
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,519
you need to help your fellow smes and

398
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,160
peers understand

399
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,959
why we need to do these things and win

400
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,600
hearts and minds

401
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,719
very insightful thank you brendan

402
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
security innovation

403
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,279
i really liked what jesse and tron both

404
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,800
said and i'm going to try and combine

405
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,279
them a little bit

406
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
sean said stories are a great way to get

407
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,120
security

408
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,560
across and make it more holistic and

409
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,440
jesse was talking about a risk-based

410
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
approach

411
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
my experience with startups and

412
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,599
innovation and

413
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
security is is very interesting and you

414
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,279
learn this lesson

415
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,480
if you're in i.t or information security

416
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,000
long enough

417
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,600
and you progress enough you learn the

418
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,279
lesson that the business is much more

419
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,079
important than what you do

420
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,360
and that you're really only there for

421
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,279
the business

422
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,639
but in a startup you learn that lesson

423
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,920
very fast

424
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,240
and you learn it very very thoroughly so

425
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,439
it was very interesting to realize that

426
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,760
risk

427
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,320
started with the ceo cto cfo

428
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
chief legal officer and it went down

429
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,920
from there

430
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,600
so we had to keep in mind we you know

431
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
there were certain security functions

432
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,839
that we

433
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
could not do right away even though they

434
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,160
might have been considered slightly

435
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,160
basic

436
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,680
because you weren't sure whether the

437
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,639
doors are going to be open

438
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,519
two weeks from now and i'm talking very

439
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
early startup

440
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,279
obviously as time goes on and as you

441
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,680
start to meet

442
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,120
goals and see yourself doing very well

443
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,359
then things change and you start to

444
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,279
advance you start to mature your program

445
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,839
it's just really interesting to see how

446
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,439
it's totally focused on risk you're

447
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,040
in the same way that you do in a fortune

448
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,120
500 company where

449
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,719
you stack your risks and you address the

450
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,279
ones that are the highest and

451
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,680
the most impact but it's just it really

452
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,439
is much more sharply focused

453
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,439
on the innovation that happens in the

454
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,920
startup you you just cannot do

455
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
certain things until a little bit more

456
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
maturity is gained

457
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,199
in the business not even in the security

458
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,199
program

459
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,079
yeah in the business right because if

460
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,279
the business isn't working well

461
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,680
your paycheck might not be working those

462
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,600
fundamentals become so much more real in

463
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,239
environments like that absolutely

464
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
so in startups right operating on burn

465
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
rates

466
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,240
where you're spending more money than

467
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,959
you're making spending investors mon

468
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,199
money no and that's in later stage right

469
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,199
and earlier stage concept c

470
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:34,399
um there aren't always big budgets or

471
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,560
big vendors so like sean exampled

472
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,480
earlier you know showing up and talking

473
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,758
to the founders with a

474
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,000
a six-figure uh

475
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:49,360
cost for a technology or vendor product

476
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,160
and well that that just might not work

477
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,079
not not in a young company judy even in

478
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,759
a later stage company that might not

479
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,120
work that's a lot of money when

480
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,000
you're not publicly traded what are some

481
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
ways

482
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,559
you've tackled security solutions with

483
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,000
less resources

484
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,599
and you want to kick us off with that

485
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,199
one shot

486
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,000
sure um so i guess one of the things

487
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,520
that happens

488
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
in startups that's a little bit

489
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,400
different i think than in the corporate

490
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,119
world

491
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
is my hiring practices were different

492
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,918
right

493
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,280
i would hire for utility rather than

494
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,760
speciality

495
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,520
in in that world uh because i needed to

496
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,440
solve multiple problems with a very

497
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,918
finite pool of people

498
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,919
and when i couldn't find people who

499
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,840
could do those specific things

500
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,520
i grew them i would find somebody with a

501
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,320
lot of potential and i threw a lot at

502
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,280
them

503
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,439
and that that's stressful but i think

504
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,760
everybody comes out of that experience

505
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,080
probably stronger practitioners so

506
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,360
solving problems that always meant

507
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,439
you know looking at the tool bag and

508
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,360
making sure you had you know kind of the

509
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,440
alton brown mentality in a kitchen you

510
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,760
never want a tool that does one thing

511
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,640
right a tool needs to do two three or

512
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,320
four things

513
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,400
to be useful and to have it in your

514
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,600
drawer and i think that that's a lesson

515
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,720
that a lot of corporate

516
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,719
security people could learn

517
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,160
like that thoughts on

518
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
small budgets big solutions jesse now

519
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000
this is one that you know all too well

520
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,840
since you and i live to a good chunk of

521
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,360
it cover my meds

522
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,360
um i definitely agree with sean uh we

523
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,039
would sometimes hire differently than

524
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,678
you would in a large corporation you

525
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,160
would grow

526
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,799
people and that is really awesome when

527
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
it

528
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:37,760
succeeds watching you know your peers

529
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,080
growing change in that way um i think

530
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,320
part of that becomes you get very

531
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,240
creative with your solutioning

532
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,520
you don't have that you know the 1.2

533
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,400
million dollar

534
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,440
it budget you've got a customer is

535
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,000
demanding or

536
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
compliance requirement is demanding that

537
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,840
we solve a thing

538
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,959
how do we check the compliance check box

539
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,918
and actually drive

540
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,559
value is often the you know business

541
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,440
driver for that kind of a thing in that

542
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,480
in that time frame and so you get

543
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
creative and

544
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,320
so it becomes a lot of at least in our

545
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,918
world became a lot of building open

546
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,678
source tooling and

547
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,440
taking a bunch of bailing wire and duct

548
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,880
tape and bundling it together

549
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,559
to build something that was it was

550
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
something we were proud of it was

551
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,039
awesome and it's on right it was you

552
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,400
know a little janky but it worked

553
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,960
and it worked well for our purposes

554
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,559
yeah you fight scale right and and the

555
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
problem you risk with the startup is if

556
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,559
you have explosive growth

557
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,400
in that first two or three years that

558
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,000
solution you built to solve the problem

559
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
that first year

560
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
may fall apart as soon as you get

561
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,240
success

562
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,039
and then you have to redo it and and

563
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
yeah that's

564
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,480
that's always fun i guess is the best

565
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,880
way of putting it

566
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,799
it isn't its own way i think my my

567
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,080
favorite analogy on that one

568
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,080
uh we set up a on-prem mail solution

569
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,000
using a it was a basic aha

570
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,600
set up and it's male you don't think

571
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,520
about it right

572
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,918
fast forward i think it was two and a

573
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,360
half years we discovered that we were

574
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,240
sending so much email

575
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,120
that we were tipping over the relay and

576
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,919
so we had to go

577
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,639
and rebuild the aha for i think it went

578
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,320
from two to five nodes and all the

579
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,799
additional things that you have to add

580
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
around dns and whatnot for it to

581
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,360
do the load balancing scale at that

582
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,678
point it was totally a start-up kind of

583
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,678
problem

584
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,919
i suspect at this stage

585
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,840
you joined root insurance budget

586
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
budgets might not have been constrained

587
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,720
but i'm sure it was

588
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,080
maybe a culture shock relative to big

589
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,640
corporate budgets

590
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,678
any lessons you'd like to share on that

591
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,679
subject with this trend then

592
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,720
i think that the budgets were pretty

593
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,679
well established

594
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,679
by the time that i tried

595
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,240
you

596
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,120
typical zoom problems so i think i was

597
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,120
employee number 240

598
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,719
so by that time the budgets were fairly

599
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,799
not constrained

600
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,559
but still i was very conscientious of it

601
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,840
you never want to have a security budget

602
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,480
that's so big that you're drawing

603
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,080
attention

604
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,320
i mean that's a very bad thing in any

605
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,039
size company so we were trying to be

606
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,918
innovative with how we dealt with things

607
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,679
root had a

608
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,320
very great advantage in that they had

609
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,360
some really really brilliant developers

610
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,678
who had done

611
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,080
a lot of block and tackle before i got

612
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,440
there and they were available to assist

613
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,080
as well so they if we had a security

614
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
concern

615
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,520
with something that they were doing they

616
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,240
were able to come and work with us

617
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
and figure out a solution sometimes it

618
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,600
was some extra code

619
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,039
sometimes it was reconfiguring some

620
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,280
stuff in

621
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,240
the cloud provider they were just really

622
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,280
really good at it

623
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,919
one of the challenges we had that really

624
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,678
made the difference was we didn't use

625
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,679
active directory

626
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,520
which is very very interesting when

627
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,120
you're trying to be an innovative small

628
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,120
company and move forward

629
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,959
try to get a huge vendor or even a

630
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,799
medium vendor to understand

631
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,400
in the beginning of the meeting that you

632
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,200
don't use active directory you actually

633
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,919
have a lot of

634
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
meetings to end quickly but that was a

635
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,360
small challenge one of the innovative

636
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,240
things that we did for budget and for

637
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,000
solving that problem was we actually

638
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,960
used the same community that we were

639
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,960
part of

640
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,240
we very often found ourselves looking to

641
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,799
startups

642
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,760
we also did as jesse said we open source

643
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,080
was a big thing

644
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,520
at root but we also turned to startups

645
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,000
we turned to companies that were

646
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,280
in the same boat or maybe earlier stage

647
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
startups even

648
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,960
and found that they had really

649
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,320
innovative solutions that could help the

650
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,000
startup community

651
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,000
with their problems in innovation

652
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,360
i love that you mentioned that and um

653
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,600
tech executive circles and well locally

654
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,280
we have such diverse companies

655
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,240
often i'll be surrounded in a room by

656
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,559
uh folks who work at some of the biggest

657
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,720
companies in the city and

658
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:12,480
one of the things i always share is

659
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:16,480
it is our responsibility to support

660
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,880
young companies if we gripe about

661
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
a lack of solutions or a lack of

662
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,640
innovation

663
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,720
that solves that problem there are

664
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,760
plenty of areas in our businesses

665
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,919
that are lower risk where

666
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,360
what would make a big impact with a

667
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,520
young company

668
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,399
and be a potentially competitive

669
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,520
advantage for

670
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,240
us would be a relative small drop in the

671
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,440
pocket

672
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,480
and budget pocket so that is so true

673
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
brendan i

674
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,880
i think it is incumbent on us all to

675
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,279
help support the larger

676
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,840
ecosystem along those lines i when we

677
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,559
talked

678
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,879
jesse brought this up we talked about

679
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,840
building things uh growing people

680
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,400
and that that is so very true and i

681
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,480
think those are universal lessons um

682
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,080
and a lot of the young companies i

683
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,120
worked with uh cover my meds we

684
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,240
deeply held that value of growing people

685
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,199
um but it's really

686
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,000
different right in a lot of shops it's

687
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,919
how do we

688
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
find this vendor to solve this problem

689
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,720
how do we support the solution that we

690
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,279
bought

691
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,279
um it's a common model i'm sure most of

692
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,799
us are familiar with it

693
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,440
in a young company it's

694
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,918
not only how do we solve this problem

695
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
but

696
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,200
how do we do it best more efficiently

697
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,039
best for us

698
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,039
and often that's a combination of

699
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,000
building it a combination of growing

700
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,200
people

701
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,720
and i i'd say like some of the coolest

702
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,679
solutions i've seen built

703
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,799
to solve real problems for in startups

704
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,000
hey can you

705
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,799
share with us jesse as some

706
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,240
things you built or or problems you've

707
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,720
solved

708
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,480
using a different approach than just

709
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,159
calling up a vendor and throwing money

710
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,440
at them

711
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,919
um so i think my best example uh so my

712
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,919
job before covering my meds we were a

713
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,360
pretty big splunk shop that was

714
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,960
my primary goal test there was to build

715
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,080
up the splunk enterprise security

716
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,640
program

717
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,720
and when i transitioned to cmm we you

718
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,600
know you didn't have the seven digits to

719
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,880
throw at splunk and that was the right

720
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,000
call

721
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,039
um but especially for a rapidly growing

722
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,960
company

723
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,640
we couldn't hire people fast enough so

724
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,039
we needed something

725
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,919
and uh at the time i joined it was

726
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,679
alienvault i believe was the the sim

727
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,279
that they had in place

728
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,240
it was barely able to keep up at that

729
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,679
point with the palo alto logs much less

730
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,360
all the other things i wanted to add to

731
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,159
it

732
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,039
so we went and we found looked at

733
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,360
options

734
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,799
hadoop was a little too heavy it was the

735
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
other thing that i was kind of familiar

736
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,400
with

737
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,080
so we found elastic and so we built an

738
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,640
elastic search cluster and this was mind

739
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,158
you the elastic 1x days

740
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,200
20 was like pre beta

741
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,640
so it had its clunkiness

742
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,240
they've smoothed many of the edges out

743
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,159
since then

744
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
but we built a nice i think it was a

745
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,120
three or five node cluster to be able to

746
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,159
ingest

747
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,158
at that scale all of our log data and

748
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,320
then all the effort spent to normalize

749
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,320
it

750
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
and that was it was it was a fun project

751
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,000
but

752
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,679
it was it was a lot of work and

753
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,039
we ended up throwing it all away for i

754
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,679
think it was like three years later

755
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
we bought splunk

756
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
yeah there's a certain skill where it

757
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,480
doesn't always make sense

758
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,799
uh that's for sure it's um

759
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,039
always i i there's been some vendor

760
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,480
solutions where they cost so much it got

761
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,879
to a point where i'm like huh

762
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,200
i can build a team to build this for

763
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,279
less than i'd pay you a year

764
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,559
i have literally told vendors that in

765
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,080
the past like

766
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:12,000
you cost too much i can go higher in fte

767
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,960
and i will do it too brendan

768
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,240
any build stories you have from your

769
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,960
startup experience

770
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,960
or or otherwise solutions you've solved

771
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,840
by building things

772
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,039
yeah actually it lends itself from what

773
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,559
i was talking about before without

774
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,279
having active directory

775
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,000
we had an identity access provider that

776
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,440
we used

777
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,480
um really great solution

778
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,039
but they work better i guess you could

779
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,600
say

780
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,799
with active directory so we had a little

781
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,360
bit of a hurdle

782
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,639
and the solutions that were built were

783
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,520
built to

784
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,559
make that work better and uh it was

785
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,600
homegrown

786
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,879
um a guy on my team who was phenomenal

787
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,799
i don't want to mention his name but he

788
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,399
knows who he is if he's listening he was

789
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,158
really really good with this solution

790
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,080
mention his name it's a compliment

791
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,880
unless he wouldn't like it

792
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,678
i don't know okay okay i probably

793
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,600
shouldn't

794
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
but yeah he was he was really great at

795
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,120
it he developed the system

796
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,279
and it was getting kudos everywhere it

797
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,918
was essentially tied into

798
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,520
hr so when they hired and onboarded

799
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,840
role-based access controls

800
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,799
all the sas applications were granted

801
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,520
right away

802
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,000
it went into the tool and did its work

803
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,320
and it

804
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,840
didn't rely on active directory so that

805
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,399
it was a phenomenal piece of work that

806
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,120
we did

807
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,639
from this ground up and i think there

808
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,600
were some people at the company who were

809
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,320
questioning

810
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,840
the time to build until it was done and

811
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,520
then it was obvious that we just saved a

812
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,039
hell of a lot of money time and effort

813
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,440
because we didn't have to roll out

814
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,480
active directory

815
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,000
that was a great great situation it's

816
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,080
funny folks hear that and

817
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,039
it's probably mind-blowing no active

818
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,080
directory

819
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:56,000
i've made a conscious effort to avoid it

820
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,760
and uh really the past five years

821
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,399
because with young companies greenfield

822
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,480
environment

823
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:08,000
modern technologies and solutions it

824
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,440
doesn't usually make sense

825
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,320
i agree it's the sas applications that

826
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,080
everyone

827
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,439
is using nowaday and if you're in a

828
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,840
company that doesn't think they're using

829
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,840
sas

830
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,199
applications you probably are and you

831
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,520
just don't know it yet

832
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,360
uh and that's just the honest truth get

833
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,120
get like a firewall check or

834
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,439
you know sas application check you'll be

835
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,479
shocked i can tell you

836
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,000
early on in route it was probably around

837
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,399
250 to 300 employees we ran a firewall

838
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,120
check

839
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,520
for about an hour and we were sure we

840
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,918
had somewhere around 30 to 40 sas

841
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,520
applications we could count officially

842
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,120
a certain number and then we figured

843
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
there'd be more there was more than

844
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,120
double

845
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,399
what we thought as a fairly generous and

846
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,918
we knew that would happen

847
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,600
because that's the story that everybody

848
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,600
tells it wasn't shocking

849
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,959
it was actually slightly lower than i

850
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
thought it might be in a nightmare

851
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,159
situation

852
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,679
but this tool helped a lot it helped

853
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,080
gather all those um

854
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,840
various resources it helped us identify

855
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,199
them it helped us correct them

856
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,720
bring the identity under proper controls

857
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,240
it was really well done that's great

858
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,240
yeah there are so many great modern

859
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,799
identity solutions now

860
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,440
that didn't exist before there are

861
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,080
really

862
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,760
multiple good ones to choose from no

863
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,039
one's paying me so i'm not going to

864
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,158
name drop them i want it anyway

865
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,158
right but there are a lot of good

866
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,799
solutions out there

867
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,520
so uh well hey before we continue

868
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,960
anything

869
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,279
you'd like to add to that subject sean

870
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,480
it's funny because my example is a

871
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,360
combination of

872
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,080
both jessie and brendan's situation um

873
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,760
we're

874
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,520
working with startups and and this is in

875
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,960
my consulting days as well as my

876
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,918
employee days

877
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,200
right um putting together for small

878
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,039
organizations that

879
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,039
you know this is a hosted platform for

880
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,000
web pages the company i was working with

881
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,360
at the time

882
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,360
and they don't they don't have an active

883
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,240
directory they also

884
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,320
don't have a sim so we're having to find

885
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,120
a way to solve that problem

886
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,080
at the same time because their customers

887
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
are coming in

888
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,279
and wanting to audit right from

889
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,640
compliance perspectives

890
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,919
and they're going so how do you manage

891
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,000
these things and the answer that they

892
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,039
have is well there's a form on a desk

893
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,880
that i give to somebody in hr and then

894
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,158
something happens and it's magic and we

895
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,240
don't really know

896
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,440
um which is very typical in the startup

897
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,039
world right

898
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,039
it's magic that anything gets done on a

899
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,600
daily basis

900
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,879
but so we ended up doing something like

901
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,879
um

902
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,519
building a security onion appliance that

903
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,080
also fed into an elastic stack

904
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,799
right and we knew day one we started

905
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,039
this project

906
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,080
knowing this is going to get thrown away

907
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,399
in a year

908
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,639
right that was the premise and when we

909
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,879
sold it to management we said look

910
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,799
we're using open source tools this will

911
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,159
not scale as the company grows

912
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,320
but right now you need to hit your

913
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,760
compliance objectives so

914
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,840
these are the tools that we can put in

915
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,879
place to do that

916
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,080
and you know for a directory we had they

917
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,000
were a google customer and they're like

918
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,279
well just use google's directory

919
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,760
we're like yeah well there's some

920
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,600
limitations there um

921
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,679
and they were largely a mac shop so

922
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,519
let's just add further complications to

923
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,679
all of these pieces

924
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,120
and everybody's afraid of ldap so you're

925
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,799
not ever going to have them stand up a

926
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,559
linux ldap

927
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,840
especially when they've got exactly one

928
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,240
security person

929
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,000
that's not a consultant on staff and

930
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,159
they know they can't support it

931
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,519
so we had to be innovative like brendan

932
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,960
said we went and

933
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,440
actually brennan and i worked together

934
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,080
on on some of the investigations he was

935
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,679
doing early on in his time peru

936
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,120
but we ended up looking at a lot of the

937
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,360
same kind of

938
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,959
startups because again there's that need

939
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,000
to feed back into startups

940
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,519
when you're a startup and we found you

941
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,360
know outside of the open source solution

942
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,440
we found a directory provider

943
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,559
that again this is a one or two year

944
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,480
solution

945
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
ex expect that it's going to burn out

946
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,519
its usefulness

947
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,639
and just plan for it and and that was

948
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,600
again the business conversation

949
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,679
great thoughts um one thing i'll just

950
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,719
mention quickly is i i hear

951
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,640
so so often that elk doesn't scale i

952
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,480
i know a dude who took it to nearly a

953
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,320
petabyte so

954
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,039
it scales maybe you can scale it or not

955
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,039
but it's a pretty sweet solution there's

956
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,640
a lot of good open source solutions out

957
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,080
there that scale but

958
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,640
it requires a higher bar of engineering

959
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,120
talent

960
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,039
so if that's not the kind of

961
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,080
organization or team you're building

962
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,039
it might not be a good fit um

963
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,918
along those same lines and we've been

964
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,120
talking

965
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,919
around this subject with a lot of young

966
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,120
companies

967
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,440
over the past five or so years many of

968
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,678
them are cloud native

969
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,519
an internet connection with no physical

970
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,360
infrastructure

971
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,360
how do you approach security differently

972
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,000
in these cloud native environments

973
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,959
uh sean kicks us off on this well that's

974
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,120
easy

975
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,799
you put the onus of security on the

976
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,638
application platform

977
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,918
and then you monitor and manage those

978
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,399
controls the

979
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,319
the idea of a coffee shop network is

980
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,118
foreign to a traditional security person

981
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,399
right

982
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,159
and that your corporate network would be

983
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,000
a coffee shop

984
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,760
but here we are every single day we live

985
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,960
in this situation right now

986
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,960
um even though there are a lot of

987
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,599
corporations that are adopting solutions

988
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,359
that

989
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,359
you know can help with the remote work

990
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,598
problem we've effectively just created

991
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,679
an

992
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,520
entire workforce working from a coffee

993
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,679
shop on a daily basis

994
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,119
and so the need to engineer controls at

995
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,119
the application entrance

996
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,879
your authorization and identity platform

997
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,760
becomes much more important than

998
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,040
a lot of people probably thought it was

999
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,000
i love that

1000
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,119
it often in security we don't make the

1001
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,079
distinction between

1002
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,440
product and um operational

1003
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,079
responsibilities i

1004
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,639
i'm seeing more rumbling about product

1005
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,320
centric

1006
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,800
cso sizzo in the market lately

1007
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,359
and it's always been innate to me

1008
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,880
because if we're building a technology

1009
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,000
solution be it an insurance

1010
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,720
platform supported by technology or a

1011
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,160
prior authorization platform

1012
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,480
uh that's supported by technology or uh

1013
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,680
ai and machine learning platform well

1014
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:25,280
it's entirely technology right

1015
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,560
well the features in the product

1016
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,599
that relate to security are so

1017
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,759
much more well maybe not more important

1018
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,720
but as important as the operational

1019
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,680
stuff

1020
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,598
and zoom had that lesson right uh not so

1021
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,399
long ago many of us in the security

1022
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,960
field are

1023
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,520
familiar with all the security features

1024
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,400
that were

1025
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,320
quickly introduced as we became more

1026
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
reliant on video conferencing

1027
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,200
technologies

1028
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,920
and it seems that in security we're

1029
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,960
often

1030
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,440
playing catch up right in startups

1031
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,160
it's often a new environment without

1032
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,359
legacy

1033
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,920
craft and i at a past shop i

1034
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,440
i used to call it unicorn catching right

1035
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,240
because we solved some

1036
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,640
unicorn problems that uh an organization

1037
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,959
with

1038
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,640
20 years of history wouldn't be able to

1039
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,440
at least would not be able to tackle

1040
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,920
easily

1041
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,240
it was difficult for us too but we could

1042
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,200
do it

1043
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,959
what are what are some unicorns that

1044
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,279
some of you have caught

1045
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,880
some problems you've solved that in most

1046
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,359
organizations you wouldn't be able to

1047
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,320
solve

1048
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,480
and this will be our last uh

1049
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,040
conversation before we move to closing

1050
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,720
thoughts i

1051
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,720
want to kick us off on this one jesse

1052
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,880
oh that's a hard one um

1053
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,720
if i had to point at one thing i would

1054
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,280
say the automation

1055
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,560
and i will wholeheartedly admit that

1056
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,040
it's imperfect

1057
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,960
still to this day but we

1058
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,960
like i just mentioned earlier scaling at

1059
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,160
humans just doesn't work especially in a

1060
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
startup

1061
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,720
and so you have to build things

1062
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,599
intelligently and

1063
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,640
strategically in order to be able to

1064
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,240
keep up

1065
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,118
and so a lot of our pipeline

1066
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,680
is computers talking to computers and i

1067
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,480
think that's actually interesting

1068
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,799
for us in some of this conversation uh

1069
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,079
cover my meds is probably

1070
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,760
one of the last large companies

1071
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,520
that startups that have become a large

1072
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,880
company that built an on-prem

1073
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,040
infrastructure

1074
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,200
we have actual blades inside the data

1075
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,960
center doing actual

1076
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,279
bit fiddling and to be completely honest

1077
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,440
i

1078
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,359
can guarantee you if we had to rebuild

1079
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,200
it today it wouldn't happen it would all

1080
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,520
go up in the cloud

1081
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,399
and we'd be leaning a lot heavier on sas

1082
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,800
applications

1083
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,560
and things to solve our problems that we

1084
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,320
just they simply weren't options back

1085
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,880
then

1086
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,960
the security model in the industry

1087
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,079
hadn't matured at that point to allow

1088
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,240
for

1089
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,760
phi type handling in most of those

1090
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,839
instances uh again

1091
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,440
warner is painfully aware of that whole

1092
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,520
conversation

1093
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,720
all we needed was about nine months and

1094
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
it would have been fundamentally

1095
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,240
different

1096
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,000
yep but the timing just wasn't there

1097
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,919
back then

1098
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,400
um so

1099
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,480
you you know if we had to do it today it

1100
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
would all be a bunch of apis talking to

1101
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,640
apis and that's actually the cool

1102
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,079
thing about a lot of sas applications is

1103
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,440
it's all natively built

1104
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,560
in i had to spend so many conversations

1105
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,720
with vendors because

1106
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,880
the i literally told a vendor at one

1107
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,959
point i think it was around the laugh

1108
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,040
i'm willing to lose some operational

1109
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,119
control strength in order to allow for

1110
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,320
automation

1111
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,359
and i meant it as long as tool b met the

1112
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,119
job if it had the api strength

1113
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,560
long term it would be a better play in

1114
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,760
most cases and they

1115
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,680
just they were one of those old funny

1116
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,440
daddy companies i didn't understand it

1117
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,118
and their ui

1118
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,040
shows it because it looks like it comes

1119
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,480
from windows 2000

1120
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,680
um so yeah it's

1121
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,000
it's a thing and i think that that's

1122
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
very

1123
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,119
important and will continue to only

1124
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,200
become more so

1125
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,400
as we become security practitioners in

1126
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,799
the cloud first world

1127
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,560
so interesting right how things change

1128
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,520
with time i'm

1129
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,440
working with a technology company that's

1130
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,560
a hundred years old right

1131
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,200
this same engineering mindset

1132
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,920
the things look way different when you

1133
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,160
have a hundred year history to pull from

1134
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,839
brendan uh unicorns you've caught and

1135
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,759
then uh after that

1136
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,160
after your thoughts on this subject we

1137
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,520
will transition into

1138
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:55,200
uh sean who will uh be uh

1139
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,599
encouraged to share his closing thoughts

1140
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,040
absolutely so one of the challenges that

1141
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,040
we had at root was

1142
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,160
we not only were very innovative very

1143
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,960
fast and uh we were cloud native

1144
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,920
they had no data center at all so it was

1145
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,839
very interesting

1146
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,960
as sean mentioned before the coffee shop

1147
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,880
mentality

1148
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,319
the office was a place where there were

1149
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,960
meeting rooms

1150
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,400
and your compatriots were easy to find

1151
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,800
if you wanted to get up and walk over to

1152
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,200
them

1153
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,640
but it wasn't necessary there was no

1154
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,118
application on premise

1155
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,078
i honestly don't recall if they had a

1156
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,040
single thing

1157
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,480
on-prem everything was a sas app or in

1158
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,880
cloud provider

1159
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,640
so one of the interesting problems that

1160
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,599
we had as a security team was

1161
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,118
how do you secure that when the office

1162
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,240
isn't important when the data center

1163
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,720
isn't important

1164
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,479
how do you actually get those devices to

1165
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,279
be secured so we built

1166
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,960
a lot of infrastructure in sas

1167
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,960
applications as well

1168
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,960
in order to handle that which was

1169
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,440
exactly the right way to go

1170
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,200
because if you have somebody who is just

1171
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,040
going to be on the internet

1172
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,279
where they are is irrelevant even if

1173
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,839
they're in the office it's irrelevant

1174
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,839
you really have to do sas applications

1175
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,160
so that when they connect

1176
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,680
their agent if it's an agent base is

1177
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,319
going to check in

1178
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,960
and that was the way to do it we managed

1179
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,640
to do

1180
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,000
many many security features and

1181
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,440
functionalities that way

1182
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,079
and that was a lot of fun because you

1183
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,880
really

1184
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,359
you did gain some limits because some of

1185
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,200
the

1186
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,960
more entrenched vendors in the security

1187
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,399
field did not have that type of an

1188
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,839
offering yet

1189
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,599
but you really did have a lot of

1190
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,319
opportunity with new startups

1191
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,760
and new innovations in the field and we

1192
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,000
were able to take advantage of a lot of

1193
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,880
it

1194
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,480
and build up client security because as

1195
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,160
i started we were a little bit different

1196
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,800
even though we were all that innovative

1197
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,160
and cloud first and everything

1198
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,200
we also had regulatory compliance so we

1199
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,920
had to control

1200
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,640
our end points to at a certain bar there

1201
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,359
was no

1202
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,078
if and about we had to do it and uh that

1203
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,000
was really

1204
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,480
the interesting unicorn chase that i had

1205
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,680
that's great thank you brandon yeah i i

1206
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,800
love the

1207
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,440
contrast uh between uh and the

1208
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,359
conversations uh jesse and brendan right

1209
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,560
because cover my mouth don't quote me on

1210
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,920
this is uh

1211
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,520
probably uh 15 plus years soul

1212
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,960
and the timing and then root is uh

1213
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:26,480
five ish years old right so a

1214
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,680
similar ethos a similar approach

1215
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,560
but just due to the timing the solutions

1216
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,598
are slightly different

1217
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,040
after i i don't

1218
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,200
spend much time with physical

1219
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,440
infrastructure these days let's just put

1220
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,359
it that way

1221
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,200
this has been such a great conversation

1222
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,200
i i appreciate

1223
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,640
all your thoughts and thank you so much

1224
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,598
for that um sean

1225
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,200
any closing thoughts before we wrap up

1226
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,280
yeah so we spent a lot of time talking

1227
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,399
about the challenges and the advantages

1228
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,760
of being in a startup and i i keep

1229
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,920
bouncing back and forth between

1230
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,440
consulting and startups in the last few

1231
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,560
years because

1232
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,560
i find that a i learn the most when i'm

1233
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,319
working with startups

1234
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,000
and i'm challenged because i have very

1235
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,319
few resources and really

1236
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,599
interesting problems to solve so if

1237
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,200
you're somebody who's been in an

1238
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,640
enterprise role and you're feeling a

1239
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,240
little bit stagnant

1240
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,000
and you want to see where the next path

1241
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,640
in your career could go

1242
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
you need to consider startups they will

1243
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,960
give you the opportunity to

1244
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,920
just fail spectacularly and still learn

1245
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,920
something

1246
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,119
um when you often don't get that

1247
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,119
capability in

1248
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,400
a you know 200 year old banking

1249
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,480
institution

1250
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
right so that's that's the big takeaway

1251
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,160
for me in my experience

1252
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,680
in both startups and consulting is

1253
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,520
consulting teaches you a lot but a

1254
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,520
startup is really hit the ground running

1255
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,240
and you learn and you can fail

1256
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,520
and it's good to fail much better than

1257
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,560
it is to succeed in many cases

1258
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,119
i i used to say three to five years in a

1259
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,000
startup a growth company and that's a

1260
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,960
key point a startup that's growing

1261
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,119
is worth 15 years in a corporation and

1262
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,079
depending on your role might even be a

1263
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,359
mini masters business as well in many

1264
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,839
mba

1265
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,400
jesse uh closing thoughts on startups

1266
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:20,400
and innovation

1267
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,359
i definitely agree with sean um

1268
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,200
one of the things that i especially now

1269
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,200
that now i'm a leader and

1270
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,399
not just as me but both as being a

1271
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,919
leader

1272
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,720
is that failure is it's not exactly

1273
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,319
encouraged

1274
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,520
but it's part of the process

1275
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,040
we allow room for those people to

1276
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,359
stretch themselves and accept

1277
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,200
that you don't always get it right the

1278
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,279
first time and that's okay

1279
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,279
it's part it's ingrained in the startup

1280
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,160
mentality because you're

1281
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,000
doing this cool unknown thing as a

1282
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,118
business in general

1283
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,200
and part of that means that you have to

1284
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,880
build these spaces that in some cases

1285
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,879
there are no answers nobody

1286
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,079
nobody's done the thing before so

1287
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,200
there's no

1288
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,119
blueprint or guidebook or guru

1289
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,720
that you can go to and go how do i do

1290
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,160
the thing you're

1291
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,160
figuring it out as you go

1292
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,240
love that thank you jesse uh brendan

1293
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,839
closing thoughts

1294
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,520
uh i wanted to close with a little story

1295
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,920
because it kind of summarizes some of

1296
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,839
what

1297
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,040
uh jessie and sean said and it talks

1298
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,000
about the agility

1299
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,680
and the innovation and speed and what

1300
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,560
you're able to do as a startup as

1301
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,520
opposed to

1302
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,279
a well-established company when i early

1303
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,560
on it root and this is purely

1304
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,839
coincidence

1305
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,319
i was passing in a hallway and i heard

1306
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,759
somebody from customer service walk up

1307
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,359
to a programmer

1308
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,960
as they were passing each other and need

1309
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,400
a brief conversation

1310
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,040
about something in our app

1311
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,480
that the customer said well why don't

1312
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,319
you do this

1313
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,160
and the customer service rep said you

1314
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,240
know that's a great idea

1315
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,680
and walked over to programming and this

1316
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,640
is about 10 o'clock in the morning i

1317
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,799
think

1318
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,879
and just coincidentally again later on

1319
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,520
in the day like 3 30 or 4 o'clock or

1320
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,760
something

1321
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,440
but some seeing two people cross paths

1322
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,960
while i happen to be there

1323
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,440
and he was telling her how it was

1324
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,440
deployed

1325
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,440
so they were able because you know micro

1326
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,359
services and devops and just

1327
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,040
the speed of innovation they were able

1328
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,960
to make the little piece of

1329
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,800
code change that they needed to do

1330
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,560
exactly what that customer suggested to

1331
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,160
improve the customer experience

1332
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,920
they were able to do it really quickly

1333
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,118
get it tested get it pushed to

1334
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,359
production

1335
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,359
i was amazed i mean that was like just

1336
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,839
very refreshing to see that turn around

1337
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,440
because

1338
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,880
if you've been in corporate america have

1339
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,079
you been in fortune 500

1340
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,119
sometimes that takes you know a prop

1341
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,520
proposition in a meeting an approval you

1342
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,079
know

1343
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,520
a ticket that has to go through a system

1344
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,680
it has to be brought into

1345
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,280
testing for days and there's another

1346
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,680
team that's going to test it

1347
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,599
the the way that it works nowadays with

1348
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,160
the innovation is phenomenally fast
