00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,839
hello

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,399
and welcome to hack for show report for

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,800
dough

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,719
um first let me congratulate you for

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,400
coming to a talk with such a boring

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,000
subject no one likes to talk about

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,599
reporting we always want to talk about

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
the new cool hacks the new cool

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,480
detection methods and things like that

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,439
but reporting i think is uh is a topic

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,480
we need to talk about

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,240
more so pat yourself on the back from me

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,240
for coming to this talk

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,000
my name is brian king um i am at bb

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,399
hacking and

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
discord places i hang out i'm a pen

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
tester with black hills infosec i've

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,640
been there for

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,399
like four or five years somewhere around

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,200
there now um

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,000
but what's different is about me is i

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,559
i'm actually an

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,559
artist uh my my education my my

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,440
undergrad education is a bachelor of

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,718
fine arts

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,399
and i think that what i learned

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,320
in being an artist and having that

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,079
training is a little different way of

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
seeing things

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,319
i got my job my first computer job was

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,760
doing tech support and then i moved into

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,919
qa testing and then

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
pen testing so maybe a little bit

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
different

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,159
path than some of you have taken anyhow

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,240
i thought i would share some stuff from

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,840
what i've learned along those ways to uh

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,839
to help you out with your reporting

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,960
so if you are a pen tester then

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,640
your report is your product a lot of pen

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
testers and a lot of people i think they

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,640
think the pen test is their product and

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,200
it's part of the product but it's it's

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,600
not the thing that people pay you for

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,360
um to be doing a pen test is not

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,158
something anybody ever wants to hire you

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
to do they want

48
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
because if you don't give them the

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
report then then there's no benefit

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
right

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
the they you get hired as a pen tester

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,119
to do a pen test yes

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
but also to tell whoever hired you about

54
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,960
what you found

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
and normally we do that with a report

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,158
and the

57
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
the report is is not a side effect some

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,880
people think you know well i'll do the

59
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
reporting later i'll take my notes as i

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
go

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,719
and then i'll do the report at the end

62
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,839
and i'll produce you know some artifacts

63
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
of my testing which will be you know

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,640
this output from the scanners and those

65
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,200
types of things and also

66
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,079
the report is an artifact of my testing

67
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,079
it is not

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
it is not a side effect it is the

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
primary thing that you're doing

70
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,679
when you're testing for pay it's a

71
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,120
little different if you're just having a

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
good time if you're doing ctfs or things

73
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,680
like that it's obviously different there

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,800
but if you're doing this

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,800
as a profession the report is

76
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
the thing that you're producing they're

77
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
not paying you to play and have a good

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,440
time

79
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
nobody there is nobody on earth who gets

80
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,560
paid to play

81
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
all these people on this slide here you

82
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,360
think of them as players they play

83
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,280
sports they play music

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
uh they play they they play roles

85
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
they're actors they're comedians

86
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,359
but even they're not getting paid to

87
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,280
play they're getting paid for what they

88
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
what they bring in they're paying for

89
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,599
the result either they're winning games

90
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,319
or they're entertaining while they lose

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,238
games

92
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,440
or if they're they're producing music

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,680
that people want to purchase

94
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,519
or they're making people laugh it's it's

95
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
the side effect of that

96
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,680
that's that's what they're getting paid

97
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,720
for um i said side effect when with

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,319
actual performers

99
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,480
it's kind of a side effect i think but

100
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
the ones who are good at it recognize

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,319
that the side effect they're having a

102
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
good time the side effect of that

103
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,079
is the actual value that they're

104
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,399
producing there's nobody

105
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,400
who gets paid literally to play

106
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,120
except kids right kids they don't really

107
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,480
get paid but that's how they make their

108
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
living right they get free room and

109
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,238
board

110
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,798
and their parents encourage them to go

111
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
out and play yes when you are a child

112
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,640
and you're learning something

113
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
you should play and and it's good that

114
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,079
kids

115
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,280
get that time right anyway but i'm not

116
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
talking about kids on the beach i'm

117
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,360
talking about you

118
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,480
as a pen tester the whatever hacking you

119
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
do during the test

120
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,518
is is interesting and cool for that time

121
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,959
but most of those things are going to

122
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,280
get fixed at some point if you're

123
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,200
exploiting some vulnerable software

124
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
that that thing is going to get fixed

125
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,560
and that exploit

126
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
isn't going to work forever if you find

127
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
something that's misconfigured and that

128
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,799
allows you access to something you

129
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,799
shouldn't have access to

130
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,720
they're going to fix that and you won't

131
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,040
be able to do that forever

132
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,959
but the report that you write that's

133
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,319
that's what lives on beyond the test

134
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,399
that's what people are going to go back

135
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,519
to to look at to see what happened

136
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,679
during this test

137
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,918
whether it's the immediate aftermath and

138
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,479
they're looking for things to

139
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,919
to make corrections things to fix or

140
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,280
down the road and they want to see

141
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,758
you know did we have a thorough pen test

142
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,559
did we see this vulnerability before

143
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
the uh pentas reports live forever um

144
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
one of the funniest things

145
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,199
i've seen as a pen tester is uh is

146
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
previous

147
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
pen test reports like you get into the

148
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,840
internal environment and looking around

149
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
and shared folders for interesting

150
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,280
documents

151
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,320
and and whenever you can find the um the

152
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,719
folder that has

153
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,759
their previous 10 pen test reports in it

154
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
that's um

155
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,720
that's pretty funny anyhow these reports

156
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
live on for a long long time and some

157
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,520
people that's all they're going to see

158
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
about your reports the people who make

159
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,599
decisions about

160
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,479
about what you found on your test

161
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
they're going to look at the report

162
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,159
they're not going to call you

163
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,919
you don't want them to call you you want

164
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,600
them to be able to look at that report

165
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
and have that stand on its own

166
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
because if they have to call you then

167
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,520
you have to remember what happened you

168
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,880
have to dig out the report yourself you

169
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,960
have to go through

170
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
some some refreshing of your memory what

171
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
actually happened during that time

172
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
and it's way better if you can explain

173
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,360
it clearly

174
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,800
in the report so that the report stands

175
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,360
on its own and you don't have to be

176
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,639
involved much beyond

177
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,479
delivering the report so

178
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
for these reasons i think that the

179
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,320
report matters more

180
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,680
than your hacking skills matter you need

181
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,599
the hacking skills obviously

182
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,759
but i personally would rather have

183
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
somebody who can hack pretty well but

184
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,120
write really well

185
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
versus the other way around a hacker

186
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
who's awesome and just just you know

187
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,000
pops things left and right and does

188
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,440
these

189
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
cool new attacks that maybe i never saw

190
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,199
before that's interesting but if that

191
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,318
person can't explain them to me

192
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,440
as a person who's hiring somebody to

193
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
do that test i don't care i don't care

194
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,400
that you're really cool

195
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,599
and and you've got new exploits and you

196
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,359
can pull off things other people can't

197
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,720
pull off if you can't explain it to me

198
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,080
in a way that makes it valuable

199
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
information for me

200
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,359
as somebody who's running an environment

201
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,280
or developing an application

202
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,400
and wants it to be more secure

203
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,318
so when you're doing uh pentas

204
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,758
you're telling a story you're you're

205
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,759
telling the story of

206
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,360
what you see in the environment um

207
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,960
you you don't want to tell you don't

208
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,319
want to try to show how awesome you are

209
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,599
you don't want to john strand says you

210
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,720
don't want to try to impress the wizards

211
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,400
wizards trying to impress

212
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,080
other wizards is is no fun it's a it's a

213
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,520
losing game for everybody

214
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,120
really you you don't need

215
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,719
to do that you don't need to try to

216
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,360
impress other people

217
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
who are hackers you need to you need to

218
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,840
describe what you found

219
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,400
it feels like you need to impress other

220
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,479
people but really really you don't

221
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,679
and i think that feeling of needing to

222
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,560
impress other people

223
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
is where imposter syndrome comes from uh

224
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,440
years ago imposter syndrome was

225
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,120
something you know a few people found a

226
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,880
few people would talk about but now it's

227
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
like it's everywhere everybody's talks

228
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,159
about

229
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,680
having imposter syndrome and we all do

230
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
everybody feels like

231
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
you know i'm i'm not the best person at

232
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
this job

233
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,440
and maybe maybe you're not i mean if

234
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,560
there is a best person that's only one

235
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,160
person and the rest of us

236
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,919
aren't as good as that person but

237
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,759
honestly there isn't a single

238
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,440
best person at a job people have

239
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
different skills they have

240
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,319
a different set of skills and that's

241
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,919
where you sometimes start to feel like

242
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
you're inadequate is if you see somebody

243
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,599
else

244
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,440
who's doing something awesome that you

245
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,800
don't know how to do

246
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
don't forget there's something awesome

247
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
you know how to do too and maybe that

248
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
person doesn't know it

249
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
but whether that person knows or not

250
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,800
doesn't matter you're you're doing the

251
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,719
work right

252
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
as long as you're doing the work you're

253
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,000
not an imposter

254
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
right you don't have to be the best in

255
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
order to be somebody who does

256
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,639
that job only one person can be the best

257
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
if you even

258
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,639
have a good definition for that and i

259
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,360
think it's no syndrome to recognize

260
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,560
your limits that you have you you know

261
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,599
certain things and there's other things

262
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
that you don't know and when you

263
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,878
recognize that

264
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
that means that that you're self-aware

265
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
and that's good

266
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,198
it doesn't mean that you're an imposter

267
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
it doesn't mean you're suffering from a

268
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
syndrome

269
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,440
i know how it feels i know it feels that

270
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,479
way i feel the same way sometimes

271
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,199
but it's not true it doesn't have to be

272
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,960
true

273
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,400
when you're doing the testing think

274
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
about yourself when you come up against

275
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,039
a wall think about yourself as somebody

276
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
that you care about

277
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,479
and as somebody that you want to see

278
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,159
succeed right because hopefully

279
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,039
you do want to see yourself succeed and

280
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,640
you do care about yourself so be kind

281
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,080
be pat yourself on the back when you

282
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,718
find something cool and don't sweat it

283
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,399
too much

284
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,080
when you miss something or when somebody

285
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,800
else finds something that maybe you

286
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,800
wouldn't have found

287
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,240
anyhow back to the story the story the

288
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,360
report what are you doing

289
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,080
when you do the pen test the story

290
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,519
is what's interesting to you in the

291
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,440
environment that you're testing

292
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,959
it's it's it's maybe a sequence of

293
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,320
events it's the ups and the downs it's

294
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,800
things that work something that didn't

295
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,959
work

296
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,640
it's alerts that you triggered its

297
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,680
techniques you tried that got blocked

298
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,279
um i like this this um

299
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,439
this methodology flow chart here um it's

300
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,959
it's fun sometimes to just google for

301
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,000
pen testing methodology

302
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,760
and look at the variety the vast

303
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
variety of different things that people

304
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
say here's a pen testing methodology

305
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,800
my favorites are the ones that are

306
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,000
linear like this like you start with

307
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
gathering information

308
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,640
and then you do your analysis and

309
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,160
planning and once you're done with that

310
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,120
you do the vulnerability identification

311
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,360
and after that

312
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,399
you do the exploitation and then you do

313
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,600
the risk analysis

314
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,320
after you've done the exploitation and

315
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,000
then at the end you do the reporting

316
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,600
a don't wait till the end to do the

317
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,640
reporting and b you're going to flop

318
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
around from those things you're going to

319
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,839
start in one place you're going to move

320
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,279
around it's never linear

321
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,920
anyway it's just fun so so a good pen

322
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,000
test

323
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
is one where you what is a good pen test

324
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
to you it's one where you came in and

325
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,600
you got what you came in for you get all

326
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,120
the flags you get you get domain admin

327
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,399
you get free writing environments maybe

328
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,079
you've got the source code for the

329
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
application that you're trying to test

330
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,959
you got room with execution you got some

331
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,240
you got in there you just got all the

332
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,359
stuff and that's so much fun and it

333
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,800
feels so great

334
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,240
and that's that's a good pen test um a

335
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,920
great pen test though

336
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,680
is one i think where you do all those

337
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
same things and you get

338
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,439
nowhere you don't get privilege

339
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,040
escalation you don't get the source code

340
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,920
for the application you you don't maybe

341
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,079
you get like

342
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,439
like cross-site request crossfit request

343
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,640
forgery you get something like

344
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,640
small and and that's all you get

345
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
but you have tried all those other

346
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,720
things

347
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,160
and that's that's great that's great for

348
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,519
the the customer because you've just

349
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
given them this huge list of attacks

350
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,959
that aren't going to work in their

351
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,079
environment

352
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,560
and that's great um there's there's no

353
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,479
winning

354
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,160
for the tester if you do a great job and

355
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,880
get all the stuff that's cool but that's

356
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,319
not winning

357
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,399
if you do a great job and don't get

358
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,560
anything that's not losing

359
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
and for the customer it's the same thing

360
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,239
there's no passing a pen test there's no

361
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,720
failing a pen test

362
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,519
there's it's just information it's just

363
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,000
information

364
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,040
so you want to write down in your report

365
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,120
what's interesting

366
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,800
about the environment good and bad and

367
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,839
and that's that's your report that's

368
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,839
what you're in there to do

369
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
when you're telling the story remember

370
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,320
that you have two audiences at least

371
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,120
um usually two uh you have you have the

372
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,279
story of the

373
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,040
the the that the technical people want

374
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,480
to hear and you have the story that the

375
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
business people want to hear so the

376
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,800
technical people

377
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,079
i imagine them as myself as somebody who

378
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,640
has the same interests

379
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,239
and roughly the same skills that i have

380
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,920
this is maybe somebody who knows

381
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
a particular technology way better than

382
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,920
i do but there's other stuff that i know

383
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,519
that maybe they don't know

384
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120
so i try to imagine this person as

385
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,079
myself a couple years ago

386
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,120
and when i'm writing down the things for

387
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,959
my report

388
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
i'm writing it in language and terms and

389
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,279
with illustrations that would have been

390
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,880
helpful to me

391
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,480
about two years ago or whenever i was

392
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,000
new at this stuff

393
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,160
and i want to make sure that that

394
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440
technical person can follow along in my

395
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
footsteps and that is to say that they

396
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
can actually recreate

397
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,079
the things that i did because i gave

398
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,720
them enough information

399
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,439
for it so that's useful for them because

400
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
then they can

401
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,519
they can double check and make sure that

402
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,360
i saw what i thought i saw and then also

403
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,360
once they fixed it they can follow the

404
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,880
same steps again and see if the fix

405
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,880
actually worked so it's good for them

406
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,480
that way the the business people

407
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,959
sometimes we forget about them

408
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,519
and sometimes we um we don't give them

409
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,680
the credit

410
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,040
i think that they deserve these are the

411
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,479
people who own the environment but they

412
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,719
don't live in the environment

413
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
these are the people who who use

414
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,519
computers

415
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,120
only for what they can get out of the

416
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
computer and not because using the

417
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,040
computer is fun

418
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,519
uh and it's easy sometimes to think well

419
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
you know

420
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,279
they don't understand they don't get how

421
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,959
the computers work

422
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,040
it's not bad it's just that that's not

423
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,479
their focus they're they're smart people

424
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
i mean you don't get to be

425
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,720
um executive people who are running

426
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,680
organizations and not be some level of

427
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
smart

428
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
so so you have to you have to still

429
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,440
treat them

430
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,719
as smart people just in a different

431
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,720
domain

432
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,560
than than the domain that you're in and

433
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
the thing to focus on for the executives

434
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,399
i think is to focus on which levers

435
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,079
to pull in their environment so is this

436
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,680
uh is this a

437
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,599
a patching and updating problem that

438
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,638
we've got here is this an inventory

439
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,399
problem we've got here

440
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
is this uh staffing for incident

441
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,600
response problem we've got here

442
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,199
those are the kind of things that they

443
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
want to know they don't care about your

444
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
cool command line hacks they want to

445
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,519
know what is the cause of the problem

446
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,639
and you know which of my managers can i

447
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,560
assign this to

448
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,680
to get it fixed so one real quick story

449
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
just to show you the difference of how

450
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,560
you would present

451
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,319
the same information to those two

452
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,079
different audiences

453
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,519
say you got um hash is stolen from a

454
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,479
domain controller you got them offline

455
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,959
you cracked 85

456
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,639
of them so the technical audience wants

457
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,160
to know how did you get those hashes

458
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,600
where where did you get them from which

459
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,959
system how did you get local admin

460
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,480
rights on that system how did you get

461
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,920
those out of my environments what were

462
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
all the things you did that i could have

463
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,160
seen

464
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,560
that i missed in order to um to achieve

465
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
that

466
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,560
result show the commands so that that

467
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,519
person can recreate those things

468
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,638
for the business audience don't mention

469
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,760
ntds.did

470
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,399
don't don't mention um password hashes

471
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,040
as such tell them what you did what did

472
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,120
you do

473
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,639
you were able to get encrypted passwords

474
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,839
for the entire environment

475
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,160
you were able to pull them out of the

476
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,040
environment you were able to crack 85

477
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,639
percent of them

478
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,880
and this shows that your password policy

479
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,480
allows people to choose weak passwords

480
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,639
and that's the lever they can pull they

481
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
can pull the password policy lever

482
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,480
uh they could maybe pull some monitoring

483
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,800
levers through that

484
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,839
those both tell the same story but in a

485
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
different way for a different audience

486
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,880
this is this was a actual comment i got

487
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,519
during tech review from one of the

488
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
reports

489
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
i did at work and this is what i'm

490
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,600
always going for i it was a test there

491
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,199
was

492
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,040
it was it was a disaster for the

493
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,000
customer there there were so many

494
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
problems

495
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,959
and just really kind of basic

496
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,680
fundamental things that they weren't

497
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,399
doing

498
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,959
correctly uh or safely or securely or

499
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,959
whatever even by correct right

500
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,160
but this the this told me this feedback

501
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,279
from internally told me that i did a

502
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
good job explaining it without being

503
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
condescending

504
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
and without beating them up too much i

505
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,000
gave them a clear and accurate story

506
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,560
that they were able then to receive and

507
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
read

508
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,279
and act on that's what i'm always going

509
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,758
for in my pen test

510
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,279
so there is it's hard to talk about

511
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,279
security right because everything is a

512
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,519
secret you're not allowed to talk

513
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,040
to the public about problems you found

514
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,680
in a pen test that you did for a

515
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,560
customer

516
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,920
because that would be bad it's it's good

517
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,518
that it is that way but it makes it hard

518
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,040
for us to have conversations about real

519
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,800
things we end up making stuff up and

520
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,800
doing proofs of concept on test systems

521
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,160
and those are great as far as they go

522
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:56,000
but they're not ever the whole story so

523
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,360
julio here has created a a repository of

524
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,480
public pentest reports

525
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,920
that's fantastic um it's it's got

526
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,519
so many of them in there now it's a big

527
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
big repository and it gives you a chance

528
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,079
to see what other people are doing when

529
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,439
they write reports some of these are

530
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,199
real reports that were meant to be

531
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,680
public for

532
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,120
public audits and things like that some

533
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,160
of them are sample reports that have

534
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,560
been like redacted

535
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,079
intentionally or done up against a test

536
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,279
environment so that

537
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,680
the person writing the report could

538
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,800
showcase their reporting abilities

539
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,800
i'm not sure where they all came from

540
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,160
but that's where a lot of them a lot of

541
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,399
them come from there

542
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,079
so i'm using some reports from this in

543
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,320
this talk and i suggest that you

544
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,160
go take a look at this yourself and and

545
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,000
see see what's there just look for look

546
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,920
for good examples if you're bad examples

547
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,199
it's a wonderful resource

548
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,279
so when you're writing why are you

549
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,160
writing you're writing to inform the

550
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,680
reader right

551
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,360
you're writing so that we can

552
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,719
communicate information to them

553
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,399
right so here is one

554
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,079
sample from one of the reports that's in

555
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,440
this repository

556
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,519
this is don't focus too much on the

557
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,639
words but this tells you what happened

558
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,680
what they found they found a weak

559
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,199
password policy

560
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,279
they show you where they found it

561
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,359
there's source code files and line

562
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,039
numbers and they tell you the impact why

563
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,119
does it matter this is a whole story

564
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,520
what i found where i found it why it

565
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,520
matters

566
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,160
going down a little bit more on this

567
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,480
they um there's they make a claim

568
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,439
they say when the um when the user goes

569
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,679
to change their password

570
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,799
it applies a six character minimum so

571
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,559
and then they show you the source code

572
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,918
where that happens so here's my claim

573
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,760
here's some evidence to support that

574
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,440
claim here's some discussion about why i

575
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,640
think that claim is important

576
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,240
and now you can disagree you could

577
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,679
as the receiver of this report you can

578
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
say that doesn't matter in my

579
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,480
environment

580
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,879
and that's fine that's your that's your

581
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
job with the report is to balance

582
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,919
different

583
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,400
uh requirements security requirements uh

584
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,640
usability requirements all that stuff

585
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,679
but this report has told you the fact

586
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,760
that they found

587
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,280
and it has interpreted them from the

588
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,120
point of view of a pen tester

589
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,399
and now you have some facts and some

590
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,399
data that you can act on

591
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,799
here's another one from q53 report they

592
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,360
did looked at cryptocap

593
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,639
and they talk about math.random they say

594
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,918
math.random is not considered

595
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,440
predictable

596
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,640
or is not considered unpredictable um so

597
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,480
i'm starting to ask some questions so

598
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
who says what do you mean not considered

599
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,080
unpredictable

600
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,840
what makes it not unpredictable why is

601
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,520
that bad

602
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,879
it's a little less factual but it still

603
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,160
it still makes an argument it still says

604
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
it makes this claim and it gives you

605
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
some information

606
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
to try to back that claim up so this is

607
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,360
still this is still good a little less

608
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,360
strong but it's still good

609
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,880
another one here we have um pro checkup

610
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,678
did an anonymized report

611
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,960
and there's a bunch going on here that

612
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,400
that i want you to notice in this

613
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
screenshot there's a lot of information

614
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,919
here

615
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,280
that's not immediately obvious and

616
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,039
the the only thing i did to this was i

617
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,240
added the arrows it would have been cool

618
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,919
it would have been better i think if the

619
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
original report had some arrows or

620
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,320
something similar to focus your

621
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,879
attention

622
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,159
but look at all that's packed into this

623
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,760
brief little thing here

624
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,360
uh on connecting the test equipment to

625
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,240
the network

626
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,600
that means they brought their own

627
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,520
equipment right they're not using

628
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,678
something that's already on the network

629
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,360
a dhcp service was available to gain ip

630
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,000
addresses okay so they plugged something

631
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,520
into the network

632
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
and they got an ip address and now they

633
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,440
could communicate on that network

634
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,639
that's useful information right there

635
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,559
maybe this network

636
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,080
is fine for that maybe it's maybe that's

637
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,520
not a problem but maybe it is a network

638
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,520
where they only you only want to have

639
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,440
authorized known devices on it so right

640
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,080
there is something interesting

641
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,720
to the reader and then in this

642
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,159
screenshot

643
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,080
a couple things about this first it's a

644
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,080
screenshot as text which is great

645
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,120
if your information is text because now

646
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,678
you can copy and paste

647
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,159
right and it wraps better around page

648
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,200
breaks rather than using an image

649
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,520
what do we have here we've got the

650
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,360
username and the hostname

651
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,760
we've got the hash at the prompt which

652
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,479
means what means your root

653
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,679
uh and we're on ifconfig for f0 and we

654
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,880
find out that we have an

655
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,960
uh uh we have an uh ipv4 address

656
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,960
and we know what network we're on the

657
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,480
hardware address there has been redacted

658
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,159
but if it was not then the reader of

659
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,600
this report if they had a good inventory

660
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,960
might be able to tell for sure if this

661
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,158
was one of their systems or not now they

662
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,400
already said it's not

663
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,280
but mac address is an identifier

664
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,640
hardware address

665
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,678
is an identifier and that's interesting

666
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
and the last part here down at the

667
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,760
bottom is the receive bytes and the

668
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,400
transmit bytes

669
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,760
that this this is interesting and is

670
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
it's not cut off it's interesting

671
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
because it tells you it's an active

672
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,559
interface

673
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,960
um that's not critical right it's we're

674
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,158
gonna it's it's safe to assume that you

675
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,559
you're probably using this interface

676
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,919
that that's how you started your testing

677
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,918
but having it there with some data going

678
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,480
back and forth not a ton it does show

679
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,039
that it's actually active on that

680
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,880
interface

681
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,640
which is interesting makes it a little

682
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
bit better a little more

683
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,200
readable a little more factual about

684
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
what the test was doing

685
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,679
aside from informing the readers you can

686
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,919
use writing to insult the reader

687
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,559
and that's something i recommend against

688
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,679
in your pen test reports

689
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,158
so here's one a company called mnemonic

690
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,880
did an audit of the norwegian voting

691
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,120
systems

692
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
source code and they have this caption

693
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,840
here

694
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,280
it says the example code was flagged by

695
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
find security bugs plugin and then it

696
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,918
says why

697
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,039
is a crypto class using an insecure

698
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,120
random generator that's

699
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,879
that's not don't ask questions in your

700
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,280
report make statements in the report

701
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,400
i think what they're saying is that an

702
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,480
insecure random

703
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,919
number generator is not an appropriate

704
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,520
thing to use for something

705
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,120
that needs to be cryptographically

706
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,200
secure and

707
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,120
that would be a better way to say it uh

708
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,600
i mean the answer to this question is

709
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,280
either we didn't know better or we did

710
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,158
know better and we chose this for some

711
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,720
other reason

712
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,159
or i mean there's not like a it's not a

713
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,880
constructive thing to do

714
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,400
it's it's very accusing uh later on here

715
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,480
it says you know interestingly

716
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,159
the method used in an insecure instance

717
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
initialized with the time as the seed

718
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,919
this seems

719
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,959
dubious it means that the bcs might try

720
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,520
to guess the seed

721
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,120
to predict it's just it doesn't come off

722
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,879
well it comes off as

723
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,879
a little bit condescending i think

724
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,240
other things you can do with your

725
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,320
writing accidentally is you can

726
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,600
disorient the reader it's easy to make

727
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,200
it's easy to make this mistake if you're

728
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
especially if you're not writing as you

729
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
go

730
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,440
it's easy to lose track of what was

731
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,400
happening um

732
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,600
during your test and not explain it in a

733
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
way that's easy to follow

734
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,600
so here's a report from security with

735
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,960
the pdo

736
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,639
bitcoin exchange this is a short report

737
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,559
and i want to be clear that i'm not

738
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,480
picking on this tester

739
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,000
i think this tester did a great job on

740
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,919
the repo on the test

741
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,120
i think the report just didn't maybe

742
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,440
didn't get enough attention

743
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,639
maybe it was um i don't know he did a

744
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,000
lot of good work i think

745
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,760
and there are things that could be

746
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
improved on the report

747
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,360
is the point i'm trying to make here uh

748
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,320
this is page one of the report there's

749
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,639
no introduction

750
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,559
there's no contest no context for what

751
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,799
we were testing here

752
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,559
uh there's there's some code here right

753
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,480
away there's uh

754
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,158
it talks about the omni-off gem that's

755
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,559
vulnerable to state fixation well what

756
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,520
is that

757
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,120
is that something that's part of the the

758
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
pdo did they write that is it a third

759
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,719
party library

760
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,840
uh i don't know what that is and then

761
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,440
there's an image tag

762
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,199
down here image source equals

763
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,000
youngbee.com

764
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,559
weibo what what is that i don't

765
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,840
understand

766
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,480
it's not obvious to me what that image

767
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,199
tag

768
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,480
is there for and then it says after that

769
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
the attacker can log into the victim's

770
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,280
account

771
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,559
um how how do they log into the victim's

772
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,559
account

773
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:39,840
i'm not i'm not clear on what's going on

774
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,279
page six of a seven page report it says

775
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,959
is a summary says using the first two

776
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,480
tricks we're able to hijack the account

777
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,279
don't don't call them tricks

778
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,840
um maybe say what they were exactly

779
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,760
using this vulnerability and that

780
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,279
vulnerability

781
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,440
then using the 2fa vulnerabilities we

782
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,480
can do the following we can we can

783
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
we can create an sms 2fa using a breach

784
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
in this controller

785
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,039
we can brute force if they're both

786
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,158
activated we can brute force this so we

787
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,240
can predict the one-time

788
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,679
one-time password which means we can

789
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,679
steal the coins from any exchange user

790
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,760
feels like that's kind of hidden right

791
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,400
steal the coins from any exchange user

792
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,240
that's

793
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,240
like the whole point of the exchange is

794
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,960
to keep those secure right that's a big

795
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,760
big deal

796
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,799
if you can steal the thing that this

797
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,320
service is meant

798
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,440
to protect um it kind of

799
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,439
kind of gets buried

800
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,439
and then at the end it's it says overall

801
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,200
it's a very secure

802
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,039
exchange and the code quality is high

803
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,480
especially because basically

804
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,039
everybody else sucks this doesn't follow

805
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,039
right i'm

806
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,640
i'm confused because on the last page

807
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,760
you said i can using these simple

808
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
vulnerabilities i could steal

809
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,919
everybody's coins

810
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,760
and now you're saying it's really

811
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,200
actually pretty good i

812
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,720
i don't understand how those two things

813
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,080
jive together so i think if the tester

814
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,760
had taken more time to

815
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,439
to reread this report and maybe think

816
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,960
about how to present the issues i think

817
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,799
it could be more clear but after i read

818
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,799
this report i have a lot of questions

819
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,840
what you want to do what you actually

820
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
want to do in your reports is you want

821
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,439
to help the reader understand

822
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,879
what you saw when you were testing so

823
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
that they can make decisions

824
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,720
you want to help them understand their

825
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,000
environment that you saw as a pen tester

826
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,520
you want to help them understand the

827
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,720
technical nature of the problems you

828
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,158
found in that environment

829
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,760
you want them to understand the

830
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,840
processes and the structures and the

831
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,600
policies and the behaviors that all led

832
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,799
to the situations that you were able to

833
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,158
exploit

834
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,918
and you want to tell them all the things

835
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,279
they're doing well all the things that

836
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,840
you tried that didn't work

837
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,440
summarize those somehow is do they have

838
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,799
uh do they have a great incident

839
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
response staff and they kept catching

840
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,918
you at every turn

841
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,678
that's great tell them that do they have

842
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,440
a really strong password policy

843
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,799
and and it makes password guessing or

844
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,520
password sprays really

845
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,840
less likely to succeed that's great tell

846
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,799
them that too

847
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,760
that's all the story the the screenshots

848
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,000
in your report

849
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,440
are there to illustrate the story

850
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,159
they're they're there to make it more

851
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,559
clear

852
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,760
they're not decorations they don't make

853
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,960
the story prettier

854
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,600
they make the story better

855
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,320
so here's uh a web app i like to use to

856
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,639
illustrate

857
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,480
this here's a screenshot of a web app

858
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
that has maybe a security vulnerability

859
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,039
in it and maybe this is a screenshot

860
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,840
that would appear

861
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,039
in a report that illustrates um this

862
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,840
vulnerability do you see what the

863
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,840
problem is

864
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,120
do you see what it is now maybe

865
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,799
how about now now it says that you're

866
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,918
not securely connected to this site

867
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,879
okay what does that mean not securely

868
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,760
connected

869
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,600
to this site um now you know probably

870
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,879
that it means it's not encrypted

871
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,240
but security is not encryption there are

872
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
other ways your connection could be

873
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,960
insecure

874
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,959
you could be routing through an insecure

875
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,840
network you could be on a coffee shop

876
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,440
network

877
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,559
there's lots of things that could mean

878
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,039
insecure and it's not just

879
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,039
encrypted

880
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,320
so this these used to be better um

881
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,960
a while ago the firefox and chrome and

882
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,200
everybody

883
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,000
had an address bar and in the address

884
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,679
bar they showed the

885
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,200
address of what you were visiting and

886
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,039
now they don't do that anymore

887
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,559
they're they're taking that stuff away

888
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,600
they're taking away the details to make

889
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,360
it

890
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,199
more user friendly i think is what they

891
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,320
say but it's hiding information that's

892
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,840
useful

893
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,080
and now um actual addresses that used to

894
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,639
be

895
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,439
in the in the address bar are getting

896
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,640
chased away

897
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,320
important parts are getting hidden

898
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,840
so here what's being hidden is the whole

899
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,279
protocol you don't know how it's

900
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,080
connecting you know the address but you

901
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,120
don't know

902
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,039
how it's getting there and

903
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,239
you can you can fix your browser you can

904
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,520
make it tell you

905
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,679
um the addresses uh in in firefox it's

906
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,720
uh

907
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,159
browser.urlbar.trim urls tell it don't

908
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,159
do that

909
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,600
because honestly if you have a url

910
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,720
without a protocol at the beginning it's

911
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,039
not a url anymore

912
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,640
and yeah so fix your browser and this is

913
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,000
a better screenshot

914
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,640
this tells you you're not securely

915
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,279
connected it circles the http part which

916
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,440
is what

917
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,559
it means here by not secure and it links

918
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,000
those two together

919
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,480
so this is what i have in my report

920
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,440
we started with this the whole thing and

921
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,000
we came back down

922
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,919
to this very focused very clear you

923
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,760
can't misunderstand this one

924
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,679
now as i said before you can disagree

925
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,080
all you want you can say that for this

926
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,120
site

927
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,760
https doesn't matter or we use http

928
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,120
on purpose for these other reasons and

929
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,799
awesome that's great it's not my

930
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,840
application it's not my choice to say

931
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,000
you must have

932
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,120
encryption it's uh it's just an

933
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,279
observation

934
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,158
and it's clear and if we can just if we

935
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,159
disagree about it

936
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,720
now we're disagreeing about something

937
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,720
specific

938
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,679
so there's two things every screenshot

939
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,399
wants to have every screenshot should be

940
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,640
helpful

941
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,399
and it should be clear helpful means

942
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,520
that it's relevant and it adds useful

943
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,639
information and it's

944
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,399
accurate clear means that it's legible

945
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,360
it directs your attention and it's

946
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,120
precise

947
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,959
so helpful and accurate i'm using as

948
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,639
synonyms here and clear and precise as

949
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,640
well so if you come i come from an arts

950
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,240
background i like helpful and clear

951
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,679
if you come from a math background or a

952
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,279
science background maybe accurate and

953
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,039
precise are better words for you so

954
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,360
accurate means it should be correct

955
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,240
it should it should be show what you

956
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,918
mean to show

957
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,640
and precise means it shouldn't show much

958
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,679
else it should be focused narrowly in

959
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,960
on what you want to illustrate so as

960
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,919
you're taking a screenshot here are some

961
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
decisions to make

962
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,520
do you want the whole browser window or

963
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,760
do you want just cropped to just an

964
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,960
important part

965
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,158
generally if you have the whole chrome

966
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,159
of the browser if you have the address

967
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,080
bar and the scroll bars and everything

968
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,440
rethink it because those aren't helpful

969
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,960
usually

970
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,799
do you want a plain screenshot because

971
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,240
the issue is just self-evident there

972
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,918
or do you need something to direct

973
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,880
people's attention with boxes and arrows

974
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,799
or things like that

975
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,720
how about the text in the screenshot is

976
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,879
that readable is it has the

977
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,240
image been shrunk down so much that it's

978
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,200
too pixelated and you can't read the

979
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,039
words

980
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,039
or on the other hand is it so big that

981
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,840
the words on the screenshot are

982
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,879
like bigger than the titles in the text

983
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,320
around it

984
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,840
you want the text that's important in

985
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,158
there to be about the same size as the

986
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,840
text that's around it

987
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,440
and then do you have just the viewport

988
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,918
or do you include the

989
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
url as well and i think you should

990
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,120
always include the url

991
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,880
if you can have it in the address bar

992
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,639
and it's readable and that fits

993
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,159
with the size and scale of what you want

994
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,760
to report that's great

995
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,520
if you can't do that then just make sure

996
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,240
the url is somewhere in text

997
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,279
near the near the screenshot so that

998
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,640
it's

999
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,840
it's not just floating out there there's

1000
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,559
a screenshot somewhere i don't know how

1001
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,600
to get there

1002
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,960
you want to make sure that your reader

1003
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,439
knows how to get to the thing that

1004
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,440
you're showing

1005
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,080
your screenshot should be composed with

1006
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,279
a little bit of thought so

1007
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,120
i said before you don't want to have the

1008
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,399
browser chrome and everything this is

1009
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,439
three different screenshots of the same

1010
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,918
issue

1011
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,519
so on the on the left we've got that you

1012
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,799
know thoughtless kind of thing it's just

1013
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,159
here's the whole page and this is the

1014
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,799
issue and here you go and it's hard to

1015
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,320
read

1016
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,918
the text is small there's a bunch of

1017
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,439
stuff in there we don't need it's

1018
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,080
unfocused it's not awesome the the top

1019
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,760
right

1020
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,678
is better it's pulled out just the

1021
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,080
important part

1022
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,960
but it's a little bit awkward the

1023
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,399
composition

1024
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,480
makes it such that the text is a little

1025
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,719
bit too small to read there's a bunch of

1026
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,960
white space or pale blue space in the

1027
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,159
top right there that's not helpful

1028
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,159
if we just shrink the window a little

1029
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,919
bit this application flows

1030
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,840
so things start to wrap differently so

1031
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,799
the bottom right there i've shrunk it

1032
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,240
small enough

1033
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:39,360
that that when it's

1034
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,440
full size in the in the report

1035
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,879
you can read all the words there's not a

1036
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,960
lot of extra white space

1037
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,399
now you can read the site url you can

1038
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,760
tell the ip address that it was

1039
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,360
you can see the time that this was done

1040
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,640
and you can see you can read all those

1041
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,840
little um

1042
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,320
red and green guys that tell you where

1043
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,320
the problem was

1044
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,880
you would have thoughtful contrast and

1045
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,320
there's some controversy over this one

1046
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,080
and i don't understand why there's

1047
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,639
controversy over this one

1048
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,360
uh dark mode right people like the dark

1049
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,120
mode

1050
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,799
and that's fine you can like dark mode

1051
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,279
all you want and you can use it all you

1052
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,720
want

1053
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,559
but in a report you're not the audience

1054
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,080
it's not for you it doesn't need to look

1055
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,080
nice to you

1056
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,120
and also if you're doing reports

1057
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,799
as uh word documents or as any a pdf or

1058
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,320
anything the background is going to be

1059
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,639
white

1060
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,918
it's going to be white and this huge

1061
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,559
contrast here this is the same

1062
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,559
screenshot

1063
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,678
in uh in bird suites uh dark mode versus

1064
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,120
regular not dark mode and the one on the

1065
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,159
right is just it's a little shocking

1066
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,518
it's a little bit there's too much

1067
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,279
contrast there it's hard to see what's

1068
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,880
going on and actually the burp

1069
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,640
version of dark mode doesn't have very

1070
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,760
good contrast either it's all just muddy

1071
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,760
gray for the most part

1072
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,320
i'm not the only one who thinks this and

1073
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,000
people writing pentest reports aren't

1074
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,840
the only ones who screw it up

1075
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,799
um this is a published book printed book

1076
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,399
uh that mobix found where they use dark

1077
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,840
mode for screenshots and you literally

1078
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,559
cannot read this i have this book and

1079
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,918
i've looked at it

1080
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,840
you cannot make out anything in that

1081
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,039
screenshot because it's so dark

1082
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,439
there's no reason for it it's not

1083
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,440
helpful

1084
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,799
you want to use thoughtful words you

1085
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,600
want to explain like i said earlier

1086
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,279
clearly to you

1087
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,279
to yourself who you were maybe two years

1088
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,480
ago you want to make it obvious how to

1089
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,760
reproduce the behavior that you're

1090
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,919
seeing that you're talking about

1091
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,000
in this section of the report include

1092
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,440
prerequisites if you have to um

1093
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,960
put something in your shopping cart and

1094
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,720
it's a specific thing that has this

1095
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,480
vulnerability then say that

1096
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,919
if you have to be on a certain part of

1097
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,039
the network in order to see

1098
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,720
the target you're going after say that

1099
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,000
make it clear which box you were on what

1100
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,200
system you were on when you did the

1101
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,200
attack so they can

1102
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,880
see how that went maybe it doesn't work

1103
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,159
from the the person who's reading it

1104
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,600
maybe their system doesn't have the same

1105
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,720
access that that system had there's a

1106
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,240
there's a firewall or a different

1107
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,880
network something

1108
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,679
make that clear and stick to the facts

1109
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,720
don't

1110
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,320
don't blame don't don't don't call

1111
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,640
people names don't say why would you do

1112
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,360
that

1113
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,520
in the report stick to the facts explain

1114
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,199
why things are the way they are to you

1115
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,879
why they appear to you the way they do

1116
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,319
what you think is important

1117
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,319
and let them make their own decisions

1118
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,599
so a couple of screenshots from these

1119
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,960
reports in julio's

1120
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,960
repo are these decorations or are these

1121
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,960
illustrations do they help or are they

1122
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,879
just taking up space

1123
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,679
so here's a cryptocat screenshot

1124
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,239
and we've got a browser there is no

1125
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,359
address

1126
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,598
in the address bar uh we've got the

1127
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,879
the inspector open so we can see there's

1128
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,240
a span

1129
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,239
class has an email address in it

1130
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,279
i don't know what this is trying to show

1131
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,759
me

1132
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,119
uh i i think i'm guessing that that

1133
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,320
iframe in the middle shouldn't be there

1134
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,839
because it says evil

1135
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,920
but there's nothing here that tells me

1136
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,480
how it got there or why i should worry

1137
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,800
about it

1138
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,839
or what it means or which part of this

1139
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,200
screenshot is

1140
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,880
even the important part for me to notice

1141
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,640
so this one's decoration this one i

1142
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,000
think uh it does tell you what

1143
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,640
application we're using so that's

1144
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,320
useful but the specifics of why this

1145
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,839
screenshot why here

1146
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,839
i'm i'm lost

1147
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,400
they did another one of uh mailvelope

1148
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,680
and so this is showing us

1149
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,240
um gmail years ago

1150
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,598
and again we've got the um we got the

1151
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,520
developer tools open

1152
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,280
and we can see there's a there's a

1153
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,680
script in there

1154
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,920
there's a script above in the the

1155
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,000
documents um compose window

1156
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,440
it says injection in progress this is

1157
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,720
the attacker's point of view

1158
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,280
what what is the attacker seeing that

1159
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,279
that i need to pay attention to if if

1160
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,920
this is the attacker's point of view

1161
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,640
they've they've got that that text in

1162
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,960
the

1163
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,920
in the uh the text area there why is the

1164
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,839
um

1165
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,119
why is the developer's tool thing open

1166
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,040
is that something they need

1167
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,160
to do the attack anyway i just i don't

1168
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,279
know what this is showing me

1169
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,839
i don't know how this is supposed to

1170
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,839
make me understand the issue better

1171
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,919
ncc group tested php my admin and i

1172
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,599
picked this screenshot

1173
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,760
because there are no screenshots in it

1174
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,200
this this the screenshot of their report

1175
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,359
they i think they have they must have a

1176
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,399
policy because there are almost never

1177
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,799
screenshots in their reports and so

1178
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,800
that's i disagree i think screenshots

1179
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,400
are super helpful and to choose not to

1180
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,640
include them i think is not

1181
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,520
great i would disagree but they've made

1182
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,920
a choice

1183
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,200
and they back it up pretty well this the

1184
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,800
words that are here

1185
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,720
are just about as good as you can get

1186
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,000
without having a screenshot

1187
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,359
so they're working within the

1188
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,560
constraints they have they've got a

1189
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,759
policy i'm guessing that says no

1190
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,759
screenshots so

1191
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,960
how do we make it clear without those

1192
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,160
and this is a great job

1193
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,880
of doing that

1194
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,920
here is one more uh one more screenshot

1195
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,560
that is just not

1196
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,800
helpful uh this one says access is

1197
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,759
granted to 10 10 10 210 as local

1198
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,960
administrator

1199
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,880
and it's a screenshot of the entire

1200
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,560
desktop

1201
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,839
and what's it trying to show well with

1202
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,680
the caption above it i think it's trying

1203
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,400
to show me that i'm logged into

1204
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,759
10 10 10 210 as the local administrator

1205
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,359
but there's nothing in that screenshot

1206
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,520
that shows me the i p address of the

1207
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,640
system i'm connected to

1208
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,720
and the only thing that gives me any

1209
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,920
clue that i'm administrator is the title

1210
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,640
under the start menu there it says

1211
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,400
administrator

1212
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,319
now that's just the username right i

1213
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,680
think it's possible for that to be

1214
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,119
you can have a user who's named

1215
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
administrator who doesn't have admin

1216
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,680
rights

1217
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,000
so it's not a super reliable indicator

1218
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,359
and even if it was it's a tiny tiny

1219
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,960
fraction of this whole screenshot

1220
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,040
all that other stuff is completely

1221
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,400
unnecessary so

1222
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,839
i would i would argue that there's a

1223
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,520
better screenshot that could have been

1224
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,960
taken to illustrate that you're logged

1225
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,640
into a particular system with a

1226
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,760
particular set of privileges

1227
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,359
and and also this is just way too big

1228
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,680
it doesn't it doesn't do what it claims

1229
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,680
to do

1230
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,680
and then another anonymized report from

1231
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,680
pro checkup

1232
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,200
i love this one because again it's a

1233
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,078
screenshot of a terminal and it shows

1234
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,000
you the text

1235
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,680
it's not an image it shows you who

1236
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,880
you're logged in as it shows you where

1237
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,720
you're sshing to

1238
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,160
so if you ssh to something called spike

1239
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,959
and you don't give it a username what's

1240
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,640
the username that you're connecting as

1241
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,079
it's whatever your current username is

1242
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,839
right so it's root

1243
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,760
and we get connected it says last login

1244
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,839
from mustang and it's got this banner

1245
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,680
and and we're logged in so it worked so

1246
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,640
i logged into the system called spike

1247
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,200
as root and then just to make it extra

1248
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,839
clear

1249
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,319
i we typed who am i semicolon another

1250
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,320
command

1251
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,599
and an id because who am i gives you the

1252
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,520
username who's logged in

1253
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,040
id gives you the uid which is actually

1254
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,240
what determines that your root because

1255
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,880
again you could have a user called root

1256
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,520
who doesn't have

1257
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,480
privileges this shows you both of those

1258
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,160
things

1259
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,160
and they went so far as to do it on a

1260
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,160
single line so that this is a more

1261
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,920
compact screenshot

1262
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,839
you might just type who am i enter and

1263
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,200
then id enter and you get the same

1264
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,680
information but it takes up more space

1265
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,078
that way

1266
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,960
so this is a well thought out screenshot

1267
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,320
that shows you

1268
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,320
exactly what they want us to see

1269
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,359
so in your screenshots you want fact and

1270
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,160
clarity you want accuracy

1271
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,279
and precision pay attention to how you

1272
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,279
you create those things

1273
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,040
this is a screenshot from one of the

1274
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,880
reports by red siege

1275
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,400
they pen tested nakatomi plaza if you

1276
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,320
can believe that

1277
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,480
they show in this one they show you the

1278
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,920
url and is readable it's a good size you

1279
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,079
can see what that is

1280
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,839
and the other thing i got an arrow

1281
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,960
pointing to here these are my arrows not

1282
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,240
theirs

1283
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,440
there's a log off button so what if what

1284
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,959
does that tell you that there's a log

1285
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,880
off button

1286
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,800
it tells you that you're logged in so

1287
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,800
this is a nice compact

1288
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,560
single screenshot that shows you where i

1289
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,760
am it shows you that i'm logged in and

1290
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,040
it shows you some of the information

1291
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,839
that i can get access to

1292
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,839
from that system

1293
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,160
later in that report they're showing you

1294
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,040
some

1295
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,359
http traffic and and again they show it

1296
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,160
as

1297
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,200
text not as an image which is great

1298
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,560
they've got this

1299
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,160
bold i added the arrows again but

1300
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,040
they've got bold the system they're

1301
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,960
connecting to

1302
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,240
they're using curl with these particular

1303
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,119
command line options and they're

1304
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,078
connecting to

1305
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,599
nakatomi plaza.nope so if you're reading

1306
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,800
this report you can do that exact same

1307
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,000
thing you can run that command

1308
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,839
yourself right now and then the response

1309
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,119
shows you the the part that they want

1310
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,880
you to pay attention to

1311
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,560
it came back with this strict transport

1312
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,319
security header and

1313
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,240
that's what we're talking about so if

1314
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,640
you run this command now you'll see that

1315
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,598
same

1316
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,799
strict transport security header and now

1317
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,920
we're on the same page now we're seeing

1318
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,119
the same things and now we can talk

1319
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,359
about whether we think that's an issue

1320
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,359
or not

1321
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,400
so again maybe the last time illustrate

1322
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,599
don't decorate don't just put a

1323
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,119
screenshot because you want to have a

1324
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,839
screenshot put a screenshot in because

1325
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,520
it helps

1326
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,440
because it clarifies it tells the story

1327
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,920
better you want to keep your audience in

1328
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,200
mind

1329
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,800
are they going to know what to see in

1330
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,200
that screenshot or do you need to direct

1331
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,119
their attention a little bit

1332
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,960
more screenshots is better as long as

1333
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,440
they're not just taking up space

1334
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,880
uh you're probably going to need boxes

1335
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,640
and arrows in your screenshots

1336
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,400
it is it is a rare screenshot that

1337
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,759
stands for itself and doesn't need any

1338
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,400
explanation

1339
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,880
they do exist absolutely but they're

1340
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,720
rare

1341
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,920
if you have one without any think for a

1342
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,359
second and make sure that you think

1343
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,359
that's the best way you can handle that

1344
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,720
formatting issues are

1345
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,400
another thing that a little bit of

1346
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,680
attention goes

1347
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,800
a long way uh you you don't have to make

1348
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,640
it art

1349
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,960
but you can make it pretty you can make

1350
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,400
it consistent uh um

1351
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,880
when uh i'm i'm kind of old

1352
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,119
and when word processors first came out

1353
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,000
that you could do multiple fonts in

1354
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,040
everybody's reports had 15 different

1355
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,560
fonts in them just because they could

1356
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,200
use it and they looked horrible

1357
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,480
because they were so inconsistent we do

1358
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,399
that now still

1359
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,839
when we format things manually like if

1360
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,079
you're double clicking on a word

1361
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,359
and you're saying bold or if you're

1362
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,880
making a heading by

1363
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,799
making it just bigger and putting an

1364
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,760
extra carriage return after it you're

1365
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,680
doing it wrong

1366
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,119
and you're making it harder on yourself

1367
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,440
than you need it to be

1368
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,720
uh scott hanselman has a series of

1369
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,480
videos called how to really use

1370
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,839
microsoft office that are wonderful for

1371
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,319
this they're brief

1372
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,400
they're to the point uh he's easy to

1373
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,800
understand and fun to listen to

1374
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,560
go watch those but take some time and

1375
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,480
just see if the way he shows you

1376
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,400
how to make these things work isn't

1377
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,280
something that you can add to your

1378
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,280
little ball of tricks

1379
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,359
a couple quick good examples from uh

1380
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,879
julio's repository here to show you some

1381
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,319
things that i think work well

1382
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,720
uh and a few that we could just tweak a

1383
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,520
little bit so in this report

1384
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,720
there's a screenshot of uh terminal

1385
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,119
output

1386
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,799
and it's on a dark background and i kind

1387
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,359
of don't like that but that's not why

1388
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,880
we're talking about this one this one is

1389
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:06,240
running gpg commands

1390
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,160
now raise your hand if you can just type

1391
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,959
gpg commands off the top of your head

1392
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,640
and get them right

1393
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,640
and interpret the output and understand

1394
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,598
what's going on

1395
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,319
i don't see any hands so what is going

1396
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,599
on here

1397
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,599
uh what's going on here is that they're

1398
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,599
verifying this signature on this

1399
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,000
application

1400
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,640
and they've got what seven eight lines

1401
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,319
of text

1402
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,640
and and that's how you're supposed to

1403
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,640
notice

1404
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,400
the the important part here is where it

1405
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,160
says good signature

1406
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,599
that's that's the key we're checking the

1407
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,879
signature we're checking who is the

1408
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,920
issue or the signature key

1409
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,240
and we're making sure that it's a good

1410
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,520
signature so this should be circled

1411
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,319
something should draw your attention to

1412
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,359
the fact that there was a good signature

1413
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,920
and then there's another command that's

1414
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,119
run we run the dot app image

1415
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,440
with dash app image signature do you

1416
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,800
know

1417
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,440
exactly what that means is that self

1418
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,240
self-evident what's going on there

1419
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,760
i don't think it is i think that could

1420
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,040
be done a little better why did we run

1421
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,599
that second command what are we supposed

1422
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,599
to see there

1423
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,000
here's another and this is just a quick

1424
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,599
show you why it's better to do terminal

1425
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,160
output or text images as text instead of

1426
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,720
as

1427
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,680
images because this one got broken

1428
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,439
across

1429
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,040
a page boundary the top of there is page

1430
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,079
9 the bottom is page 10.

1431
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,000
if this had been put in as an image

1432
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,079
there'd be an inch and a half blank

1433
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,520
space at the bottom of page nine

1434
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,000
and then page ten would start with the

1435
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,200
whole screenshot

1436
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,359
that makes it harder to read a little

1437
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,078
bit harder to follow so if you have text

1438
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,880
present it as text and and look it's a

1439
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,960
light background

1440
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,160
with dark text like every word

1441
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,160
processing document ever

1442
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,759
uh proton vpn windows app

1443
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,200
the interesting thing about this one is

1444
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,440
it's not a screenshot but it's telling

1445
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,759
you

1446
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,680
exactly what they tested there's a shot

1447
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,520
on some of these files that were part of

1448
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,520
what they tested even of the readme

1449
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,040
so if you want to if you're trying to

1450
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,480
fix this or you're trying to recreate

1451
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,440
these issues you can know exactly what

1452
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,720
they were looking at

1453
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,839
and whether you're looking at the same

1454
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,839
thing or not this is fantastic

1455
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,880
same application this is some text but

1456
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,520
it's not shown as text but it's okay

1457
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,160
here

1458
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,520
i think because it's small and it's

1459
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,240
awesome because they highlight

1460
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,040
the part that's important they use the

1461
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,399
they use their hex

1462
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,440
editor itself to do the highlighting

1463
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,079
they just selected that and it's

1464
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,200
highlighted

1465
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,359
nothing had to be done after the

1466
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,480
screenshot was taken to show you the

1467
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,920
important part of it

1468
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,760
now imagine you got the screenshot but

1469
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,359
nothing was highlighted

1470
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,040
what are you supposed to make of this

1471
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,200
you might you might know as

1472
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,480
as a tester as somebody who's familiar

1473
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,480
with looking at hex dumps

1474
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,760
but not everyone's going to know that

1475
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,200
your executives certainly aren't going

1476
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,480
to be familiar with this

1477
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,520
and your newer technical folks

1478
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,040
they might not either they might

1479
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,560
recognize that oh i think that's hex but

1480
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,319
they might not know how to interpret it

1481
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,319
so this is a huge help to have that

1482
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,880
so it doesn't have to be art but you can

1483
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,720
still make it pretty

1484
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,079
keep thing use formatting to keep things

1485
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,640
consistent use it to focus

1486
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,839
the attention to the right things and

1487
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,078
make the computer do it look at those

1488
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:11,119
handsome videos and he will help you see

1489
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,119
how to make word do your work for you

1490
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,920
a couple of things not to do

1491
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,920
uh never ever ever copy and paste from a

1492
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,040
previous report i don't care how small

1493
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,960
it is

1494
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,720
the risk that you accidentally include

1495
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,000
one customer's information in a report

1496
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,200
that goes to another customer

1497
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,640
is too high to to benefit the brief time

1498
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
savings of copying and pasting

1499
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,480
from one report to another so but you

1500
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,919
say oh but

1501
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,680
i've seen this issue before i don't want

1502
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,160
to have to write all those words again i

1503
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,480
agree

1504
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,240
don't write it up once generically with

1505
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,960
no customer information and save that

1506
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,078
somewhere

1507
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,000
and then when you see that same

1508
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,440
information copy and paste from there

1509
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,440
just don't copy and paste from another

1510
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,920
report

1511
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,680
and also tool output don't ever just

1512
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,280
assume that the tool output stands on

1513
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,040
its own either

1514
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,640
the tools are things that can be bought

1515
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,000
a lot of them are free so if you're just

1516
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,200
giving me tool output then what's the

1517
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,200
value that you're adding

1518
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,640
as a technical person why should i hire

1519
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,240
you again if you're just going to run

1520
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,240
tools that i could run

1521
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,919
i could pay my employees way less than i

1522
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,799
pay the consultant to do the same thing

1523
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,200
so

1524
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,040
make sure that you're giving context and

1525
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,319
some analysis and why that's important

1526
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,319
not just tool output

1527
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,160
one more thing that gets overlooked is

1528
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,960
um is using colors

1529
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,319
it's generally speaking a bad idea to

1530
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,200
convey information

1531
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,000
with color alone and the reason for that

1532
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,598
is

1533
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,200
that there are there are people who

1534
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,079
don't see colors the same way you see

1535
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,640
colors

1536
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,520
and colors don't always translate across

1537
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,598
media

1538
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,040
and sometimes people still print things

1539
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,319
out and look at them and sometimes they

1540
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,200
print them out in black and white and

1541
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,200
then there's no color

1542
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,319
so this is a this is from one of the

1543
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,480
reports in

1544
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,160
in that repo i showed you and it shows

1545
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,359
you the the risk ratings and the color

1546
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,920
they use for those risk ratings on the

1547
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,000
left

1548
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,079
is how it appears in the report on the

1549
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,880
right is how it would appear to somebody

1550
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,559
who is who has got the red blind version

1551
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,559
of color blindness

1552
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,160
and if you look at that in the key the

1553
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,480
informational stuff and the high stuff

1554
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,879
are

1555
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,000
almost the same they're almost identical

1556
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,440
so it's not a

1557
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,839
great useful gradient to use red for bad

1558
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,839
and green for good

1559
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,480
so what do you do about it what do you

1560
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,839
we always red means bad and green means

1561
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,440
good right and that's a common thing

1562
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,240
that people use so what do you do

1563
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,599
instead

1564
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,078
here's something you can do instead

1565
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,040
looking at the the red siege report

1566
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,720
they use color and symbols to to convey

1567
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,119
the information so we have

1568
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,040
uh a red circle with the exclamation

1569
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,480
point is the highest severity thing so

1570
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,920
even when you lose the red you still get

1571
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,520
the exclamation point

1572
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,119
the orange circle that's solid is the

1573
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,720
medium one so you still get a solid

1574
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,520
circle and a half filled circle and an

1575
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,000
empty circle

1576
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,800
so using something besides color to

1577
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,839
redundantly convey the same information

1578
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,559
makes it more useful in more different

1579
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,599
places

1580
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,760
the other thing you can do is you can

1581
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,319
try to use colors that are still

1582
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,520
distinguishable even for folks that

1583
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,880
don't see colors

1584
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,400
the same way you see them and this is

1585
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,680
hard because there's less there are

1586
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,720
different kinds of color blindness and

1587
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,480
they don't all manifest

1588
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,720
the same way so it's difficult to come

1589
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,880
up with more than two colors really that

1590
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,160
you can reliably distinguish

1591
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,319
but here's a report that tried to do

1592
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,240
that and they did pretty well i think

1593
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,000
you can those all look pretty different

1594
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,200
except two and four

1595
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,040
look pretty similar

1596
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,720
but that that goes to the point of view

1597
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,759
something besides color but you can

1598
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,078
you can do you can choose colors that

1599
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,040
are

1600
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,040
more distinguishable

1601
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,960
the last thing i want to show you really

1602
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,160
quick i just want to point you at some

1603
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,920
of these

1604
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,078
things you can use do in microsoft word

1605
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,200
to make word better for you

1606
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,200
a lot of reports are still done in

1607
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,000
microsoft word so if you don't use word

1608
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,960
you can skip this

1609
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,079
but if you do look into using styles to

1610
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,920
keep things consistent

1611
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,599
don't format words and phrases

1612
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,599
independently with bold and italic and

1613
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,839
bigger use styles

1614
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,440
you can use autocorrect to save time so

1615
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,960
when you type something in

1616
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,640
that's a misspelling that word knows

1617
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,680
about it fixes it for you right you can

1618
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,598
define your own

1619
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,200
and you can make anything expand into

1620
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,240
anything else so i have

1621
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,000
in my word i have some abbreviations uh

1622
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,118
that i put in as misspellings

1623
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,880
and the correct spelling is a whole

1624
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,240
paragraph of text so i type in one

1625
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,200
little thing and poof i get out i get

1626
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,558
that whole paragraph

1627
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,960
all at once you can use macros for

1628
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,640
things

1629
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,079
that aren't trying to pop a shell you

1630
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,799
can use macros to go through the

1631
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,280
document

1632
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,800
and check formatting and clean things up

1633
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,960
you can use a custom dictionary with

1634
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,319
words that you

1635
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,319
that microsoft word would normally

1636
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,960
complain about spelling wrong

1637
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,240
to see less of those and a lot of these

1638
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,280
things get stored in a file called

1639
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,919
normal.or normal.m

1640
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,720
and those will carry with you across

1641
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,280
every

1642
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,078
new document you create from that

1643
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,000
installation

1644
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,520
of microsoft word scott hanselman gets

1645
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,599
into some of those things

1646
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,319
but they're worth exploring on your own

1647
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,079
so auto correct macros custom dictionary

1648
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,839
those are things that you can google to

1649
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,640
find how to get started with them and

1650
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:14,240
see if they might be useful for you

1651
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,879
so as i said before your report matters

1652
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,439
more than your hacking it really really

1653
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,359
does

1654
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,800
without a report the hacking might as

1655
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,078
well not have happened as far as the

1656
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,359
people who need to fix it

1657
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:28,319
are concerned so pay attention try to do

1658
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,000
well look at it as you're going and stop

1659
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,759
for a second look at it again and see

1660
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,280
does that make sense to me if i wasn't

1661
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,640
the one who wrote this would i know why

1662
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,319
that screenshot's there and what i'm

1663
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,359
supposed to get out of it have i

1664
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,759
described the issue

1665
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,200
clearly and fairly and factually so that

1666
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,960
somebody with different opinions and

1667
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,399
different priorities than me

1668
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,400
can make an informed decision

1669
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,440
a couple quick references and that is it

1670
00:51:51,680 --> 00:52:04,000
thank you for coming i'm i think i'm

1671
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:04,000
around for any questions
