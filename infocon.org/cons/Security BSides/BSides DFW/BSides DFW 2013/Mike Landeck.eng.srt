00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,460
in this day and age the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key is very</font>

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,530
important and the delight of security

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,690
professionals out there that know a lot

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,070
about security but a security

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,930
professionals were not taught much about

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,330
business acumen how to how to lead an

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,460
organization how to how to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to her</font>

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,259
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> about security we all speak</font>

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,630
we all speak security language but very

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,640
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us big business language and what</font>

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,310
happens is you see security<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,870
professionals and their organizations

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,269
become outside the primary organization

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,290
and for security to be effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

15
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,400
have to have it embedded in the

16
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,559
organization you hear a lot about

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,360
security being baked into an

18
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,610
architecture it has to be baked in the

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,440
processes as well well we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a lot</font>

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,390
security we've done a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to ourselves we've we've spent time</font>

22
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,110
playing the Fed card we've no fear

23
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,049
uncertainty and doubt we've we've got

24
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,780
our needs met by by through fear and

25
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:58,460
scaring people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we like to build</font>

26
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,710
empires we all build our own little

27
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,869
security fiefdoms so instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a</font>

28
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,489
place at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organizational table we've</font>

29
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:06,380
got the security table outside of the

30
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,780
organization and that's not an effective

31
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,580
way to lead security yeah the power of

32
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pelvic in from fun is short-lived</font>

33
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,270
and the truth is it doesn't work

34
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,850
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at myself</font>

35
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,560
I could get a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> injection where it</font>

36
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,479
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fixed so I depa database to a</font>

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,079
thumb drive instead here I played the

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,210
flood card sometimes it works but you if

39
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,979
you do it too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you're going to lose</font>

40
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,999
credibility and have become<font color="#CCCCCC"> ineffective</font>

41
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:33,619
and in your ear point that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

42
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:36,770
becoming the obstructions that worm

43
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:39,469
accused of being it's a very short note

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,929
it's a very shortly way to be effective

45
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,990
do more cost-benefit analysis do more

46
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:47,359
risk analysis you know do more do more

47
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,389
staffing analysis you know it's really

48
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,038
we instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of playing the fear card or</font>

49
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:54,139
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just saying I have enough</font>

50
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:55,789
money say what it you know what is it

51
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:57,589
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need and why and we don't we</font>

52
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,569
insecurities we do a very poor job of

53
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,280
saying you know here's our staff

54
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:03,679
utilization rates here's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,030
do here's a here's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good risk</font>

56
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,740
assessment here's a cost-benefit

57
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,390
analysis here's our here's our business

58
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,728
justification so that the takeaway

59
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,940
really is do more math as odd as that

60
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,800
sounds we we speak we speak security

61
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,230
speak you and I know what ponen and

62
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,160
network means and we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a really</font>

63
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,899
good eye we are

64
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,359
stand what the cost to accompany is a

65
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,340
poner network means but we don't know

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,320
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that in business speak you</font>

67
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,690
know what we do is instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of saying if</font>

68
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,940
this were compromised it would impact

69
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,250
our ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create 500 widgets per</font>

70
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,880
day instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that we say yeah</font>

71
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,790
I'd be bad instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying and what we</font>

72
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,350
do is when we ask for things will say I

73
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,570
met I'm not getting more help making

74
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,030
security better what we should be saying

75
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,070
is I want your<font color="#CCCCCC"> support and implementing</font>

76
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,530
a policy that no one tested code goes a

77
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,000
production so we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it overall</font>

78
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,090
profession we have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better at</font>

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">being very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> specific and clear on what we</font>

80
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,860
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make our organizations effective</font>

81
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,750
you
