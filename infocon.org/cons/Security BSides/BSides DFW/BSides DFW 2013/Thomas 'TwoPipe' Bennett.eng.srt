00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,980
our presentation was basically to teach

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">people how to set up their network or</font>

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:18,099
how to study stuff to compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">CTFs which are captured the flags where</font>

5
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,160
they'll set up hey there's a flag on

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,529
this machine you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to find this</font>

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,689
vulnerable way to get in that type of

8
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:27,550
stuff the main point behind it is

9
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:31,300
certain companies actually come to those

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">type</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of competitions and watch as ways</font>

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,399
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find people and how they work with</font>

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,320
teams and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> around that type of stuff</font>

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's</font>

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to fill you know the void in their</font>

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,250
corporation or enterprise we were we

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,470
were talking about setting up you know

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">different databases of information</font>

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,150
different ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate with each</font>

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,190
other using certificates so that you

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,780
know who's on your team all that fun

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,780
stuff you're protecting your own team

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,800
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting up team roles so</font>

23
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,328
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone doing database stuff</font>

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,509
you've got someone doing OS stuff

25
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:10,929
someone running the network and how to

26
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:12,250
set that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all up and capturing all of the</font>

27
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,320
data while you're there so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

28
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,970
go back you can look at how other teams

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,130
were doing stuff if you were able to

30
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,658
capture that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how you did it see</font>

31
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,000
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do it in a better way faster</font>

32
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,620
way so on our team<font color="#CCCCCC"> we usually try to set</font>

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,960
it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have someone doing database</font>

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,450
type exploitation we have OS type of

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,399
exploitation network type we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

36
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,140
network guru who's sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Manning</font>

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,500
the firewall and watching the network

38
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,420
activity and going in and out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

39
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,820
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have the noob to the team who</font>

40
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,400
goes and gets the drinks or researches

41
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,779
stuff on Google so we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up</font>

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,820
with different positions so that each

43
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,490
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing their own thing and then</font>

44
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,689

45
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,689
