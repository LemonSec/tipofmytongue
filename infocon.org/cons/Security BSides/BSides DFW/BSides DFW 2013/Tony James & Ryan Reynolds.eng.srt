1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,000
so when Penn temps<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentest firms come</font>

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:15,340
out there red teamers they go out there

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,410
and they just nuke the network and they

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,960
just go right<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the bat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just start</font>

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,448
firing off scans what we come to is we

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,400
want to mimic a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real world attack and we</font>

7
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,140
want to say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the apt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one or</font>

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,340
whoever in your network and they're

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna they're going to be like a Navy</font>

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,340
SEAL they're going to be nice and

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">stealthy and they're just going to use</font>

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,680
all basic basic authentication windows

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,989
tools such such and such keeping it

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,320
under the radar no the traditional way

15
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:43,300
does work in effect but you get more

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,340
coverage out of a traditional way so you

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,010
can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out you could see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> schoo</font>

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,530
you'll have a whole scope you'll be able

19
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to find more vulnerabilities than your</font>

20
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,120
typical then<font color="#E5E5E5"> your stealth engagement</font>

21
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,129
that we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pushing towards but</font>

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,599
then again going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the stealth</font>

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,070
engagement you're going to see the real

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,300
world attack you're going to see how

25
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,860
they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get in there</font>

26
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,509
they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and blast</font>

27
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,590
away like we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

28
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:07,149
to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font>

29
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,229
to go straight for the goods they want

30
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:10,450
the goods<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they want to get them out</font>

31
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:13,600
without getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> caught so I think that</font>

32
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:16,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">the takeaway should be if you are going</font>

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a red team exercise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go on or a</font>

34
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,199
penetration test that you need to first

35
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,329
really focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the planning and the</font>

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,149
objectives of that service so which

37
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:31,240
should be one do you want to identify as

38
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:32,829
many vulnerabilities as possible and if

39
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,609
so then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not too concerned</font>

40
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:37,958
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know detective controls but if</font>

41
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:39,818
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned about detective</font>

42
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,799
controls then you should be flushing out

43
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:45,189
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the planning process and</font>

44
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:48,159
there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know methodologies that we</font>

45
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,169
discussed that can help with actual

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,029
reviewing and determining if your pen

47
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:54,099
testers do have those skill sets to do a

48
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:57,908
stealth pen test so one of the things we

49
00:01:54,099 --> 00:02:00,459
also see is you know SCCM that will try

50
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,289
to do you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> updates at you know lunch</font>

51
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:06,189
when everyone's out or something right

52
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,840
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> configure that to either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

53
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,030
talk to domain

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,250
computers or you can configure that to

55
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,769
talk to you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your subnets so as</font>

56
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,920
bad guys we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have constant packet</font>

57
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:19,720
capture running and so I CCN comes with

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,238
domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> admin credentials push out the</font>

59
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,790
latest updates and boom since they're

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,129
doing it on a per subnet basis we

61
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,140
capture those and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to crack</font>

62
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,629
them so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of know how your</font>

63
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,839
software is working<font color="#CCCCCC"> and limited down to</font>

64
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:36,548
as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you can we want management we</font>

65
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,950
want IT we want security we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

66
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,079
basic employees just to see hey this

67
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,238
will this is what can happen and it's

68
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:45,459
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hard you don't need the the</font>

69
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,049
great latest and greatest technology to

70
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,090
find all this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just all about</font>

71
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,670
throwing in there those couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

72
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,269
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we recommend or that people</font>

73
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,750
should consider in trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify</font>

74
00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:00,209
some of this traffic or that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

75
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,799
the most common problem we see is that

76
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,260
management doesn't and we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> non</font>

77
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:08,709
technical management doesn't understand

78
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,510
the results or the methodologies of a

79
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,910
pen test so they say hey we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

80
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,790
can we be broken in right and so they

81
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,260
hire<font color="#E5E5E5"> this firm to do this and they don't</font>

82
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">know any of the details about it but</font>

83
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,160
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a report</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the report says</font>

84
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,690
hey we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in good shape or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we caught</font>

85
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,019
these bad guys so we detect a real

86
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:29,410
attack weren't great but there's a big

87
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:31,750
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the scale of you know</font>

88
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">quality service that can be provided and</font>

89
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,650
just kind of getting that report done as

90
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,108
fast as possible and so that's the thing

91
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we typically run into from client</font>

92
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,400
you
