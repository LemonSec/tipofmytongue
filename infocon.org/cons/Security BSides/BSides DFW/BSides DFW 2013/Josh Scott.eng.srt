1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:15,480
my talk was essentially security for

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,480
activists so today you know with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,920
NSA news and things like that it's

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,920
becoming abundantly clear that weren't

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,300
or constant surveillance technology has

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,029
permeated all aspects of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives and</font>

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was to do a talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how we</font>

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,890
activism is evolved into to where it is

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,350
now and security measures that need to

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:42,390
be taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect yourself as an</font>

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:45,030
activist activism is typically a if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,329
outright illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's skirting very</font>

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,030
close to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law and I'll get</font>

14
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,559
red-flagged alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah absolutely</font>

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">just being just being a member of</font>

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,660
Greenpeace can actually get you tonight

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,590
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security clearance so the the</font>

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,218
<font color="#E5E5E5">United States government especially</font>

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,129
considers environmental activism very

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,350
very close to terrorism so there's been

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of Greenpeace activists</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font>

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,070
been put on terrorist watch list for

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,290
example peaceful they've never committed

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,758
any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> act of violence there's no</font>

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,020
evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could that they plan</font>

26
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,530
to commit an act of violence but they're

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,759
put on terrorist watch lists regardless

28
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:27,500
PETA PETA is a little bit more tense to

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,909
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a extremists</font>

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,200
association with it but still for the

31
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,450
most part they're very peaceful they

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,650
don't commit extremist acts same thing

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,780
they a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been put on</font>

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,340
terrorist watch list as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well no fly</font>

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">lists they can't get on a plane things</font>

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,149
like that so yeah and they've never

37
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,619
committed they've no yeah absolutely

38
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've never really even committed a</font>

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,790
crime they've just been associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,829
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization there's people that</font>

41
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,719
have lost jobs just because of this of

42
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,960
their political affiliations or their

43
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,539
activist affiliations so it's very

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,130
important to a decide if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a risk</font>

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,530
you're willing to take and if it is what

46
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,929
safeguards<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take to make sure that it</font>

47
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,370
doesn't have long-term ramifications

48
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:08,940
there's no one simple

49
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:12,240
Lucien unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to be really</font>

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,160
secure there's a patchwork of things you

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,560
need to do unfortunately you need to do

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,660
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> real life operational security you</font>

53

61
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,420
if you're an activist you can't trust

your cell phone treat it like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the</font>

plague the the government corporations

64
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,670
have the ability to monitor track you

68
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:56,850
it depends I mean they all have

69
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,160
microphones in them they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all capable</font>

70
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,930
if there's some way there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way of</font>

71
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,880
being switched on if it's got GPS you

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,720
can be tracked in through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it even pay as</font>

73
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,400
you go the 3-axis accelerometer that's

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,230
present most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smartphone's they</font>

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,580
head of technology for the CIA said as

78
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,770
much in a talk earlier this year there I

79
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,830
think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the GigaOM conference at</font>

80
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the beginning of the 2013 so yeah it is</font>

81
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,760
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear that so it's</font>

82
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,489
we're getting to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where we</font>

83
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this ubiquitous surveillance that</font>

84
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">is never going away and never forgets</font>

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,140
you know like 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> years from now the</font>

86
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,209
things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> put on myspace will still be</font>

87
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,649
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the things that we</font>

88
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,200
probably should have never put on

89
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,580
myspace are still there operational

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,850
security in your life make sure that

91
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,890
you're not not cross contaminating your

92
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,239
activist life with your real life you

93
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,130
know you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep the two separate</font>

94
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,620
tree activism like a job treat<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home</font>

other to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you those are the two big ones</font>

98
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you don't want to bring work</font>

99
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,980
home with you you don't want to take

100
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,690
home to work depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what type of</font>

101

activism you're doing some of it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

102
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">very peaceful writing letters to</font>

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,810
companies writing letters to your

104
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,089
government representatives some of it

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,959
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very you know some of them take</font>

106
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,769
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the extreme where they're doing</font>

107

things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that burning cars burning</font>

109
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,229
buildings things like that which I don't

recommend or advocate in any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape</font>

111

or form but some people do take it to

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,220
that level and if you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>
