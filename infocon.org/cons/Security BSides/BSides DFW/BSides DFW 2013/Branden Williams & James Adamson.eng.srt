1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,840
so for us we we've been working with

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,930
this pci standard for a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI</font>

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,849
DSS it's an original incarnation was

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,860
2004 but before that there were other

5
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:21,529
standards that kind of became what PCI

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,790
is today and it's a big year for PCI

7
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:25,220
because it's a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> version being</font>

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,079
released so they switched<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the last</font>

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,668
time they did a release they said we're

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,259
only releasing every three years now

11
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:31,790
instead every two years so they lengthen

12
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,829
the release cycle which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,750
there's obviously potential for a lot

14
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things to change more stuff to get</font>

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,079
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is it's a release year</font>

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,460
so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of critical stuff that</font>

17
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,320
you know if you have to deal with PCI

18
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,750
and a day to day basis there are things

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest</font>

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I wanted to accomplish with</font>

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,249
this presentation was to provide some

22
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:56,690
clarity around what's coming out in the

23
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:59,329
new version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the PCI DSS they have a</font>

24
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">very long rollout schedule it goes from</font>

25
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:04,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">August in November where they slowly</font>

26
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,620
reveal what's behind the curtain and as

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,870
that happens there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large degree of</font>

28
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:13,939
uncertainty about how it's going to

29
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:16,930
impact your your business how you're

30
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:19,820
going to adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> and react to it and</font>

31
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,310
providing just a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we</font>

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">saw as the important parts of those</font>

33
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,610
changes I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> could help help get</font>

34
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,979
some some clarity for everybody who's

35
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,920
out there to understand what what they

36
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:35,689
should focus on so 20 is active until

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,610
the end of next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year so all this noise</font>

38
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,008
we're making is so you can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready on</font>

39
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">January one in December sorry January</font>

40
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:46,130
one point 15 there are some requirements

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,700
that are best practice until July 2015

42
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,170
so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue is like if you have</font>

43
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,490
if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a requirement to the plight</font>

44
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,079
of the PCI then you should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some</font>

45
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,460
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a gap analysis now because you</font>

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,538
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what changes you're</font>

47
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,250
gonna have to implement over the next

48
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:59,530
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two years so that when that</font>

49
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual assessment comes through</font>

50
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,470
I would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know pci today is</font>

51
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,110
typically treated as something from a

52
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,399
compliance standard where you know it's

53
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,929
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm gonna do</font>

54
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,550
the absolute minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have to do</font>

55
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,709
in order to get by and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy</font>

56
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,850
you know look for Assessors that you

57
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,950
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the easiest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font>

58
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,530
and I just I just don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it at</font>

59
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">all and while I would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

60
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,890
we see a lot of customers that do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

61
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,270
and you know as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're not the</font>

62
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,458
one that gets breached<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets breached</font>

63
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,600
them you're probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i would say</font>

64
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a lot of better</font>

65
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,980
strategies focusing on information

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,959
security pieces as well as focusing on

67
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,488
outsourcing and and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> other types</font>

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,870
of security things you can do to the

69
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,670
credit card information so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

70
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">even a problem for you anymore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

71
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,929
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest advice that I would give</font>

72
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:49,930
someone is to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you budget</font>

73
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:53,620
enough time to adjust to the changes

74
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:57,100
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that is going to be</font>

75
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,690
done you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in one day there's going</font>

76
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,470
to be things that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have</font>

77
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:05,200
to manage over the course of several

78
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,000
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a month in different projects</font>

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,570
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spin off of this and</font>

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to underestimate the time that it's</font>

81
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,609
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take while there may not be</font>

82
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,620
major technology changes that are going

83
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be required it is going to require</font>

84
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,489
time to administrate the changes that

85
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,489
are in the new standard

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,980
you
