1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,410
so the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,600
solve is is collaboration on incident

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,448
response and and digital forensics you

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,698
know so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these problems are</font>

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,500
really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and they're often really</font>

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard because we've made it difficult to</font>

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,750
work together on them you know if I'm a

8
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:27,909
forensics analyst and I find something I

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,279
think is important I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font>

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,370
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> room or or find somebody else to</font>

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,810
go work on the malware for me and then I

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,459
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait for his response to come</font>

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,489
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> before I can go use that to start</font>

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">digging into what I'm working on on the</font>

15
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:43,870
the disk forensics and I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it easier for those types of groups</font>

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,910
to collaborate and work together and and

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,190
share information<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an organic way to</font>

19
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,839
make them faster and more effective but

20
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,608
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this allows us to</font>

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,039
put all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in the chat now if Kyle and</font>

22
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:59,199
I were both interacting we were safer

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an incident response together we</font>

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,250
have all these lookups in one thing he

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,710
understands how I'm looking stuff up and

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,660
it really gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that whole forensic idea</font>

27
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,490
of showing repeatable processes and

28
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,410
things like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the the</font>

29
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,750
simplest answer would be to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

30
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,310
for those ways to work together the

31
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,170
slightly more complex one is you know I

32
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a tool called Hugh bot</font>

33
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,700
that's really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my company</font>

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,320
from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Operations perspective and tried</font>

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,990
to modify it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really useful from a</font>

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,669
security operations perspective and it

37
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,399
was more successful than I would have

38
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,740
thought possible so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up</font>

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,640
being a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think that</font>

40
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,740
that workflow<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that methodology of you</font>

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,690
know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use that as the glue to</font>

42
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that collaboration go together is</font>

43
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,960
really effective and really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

44
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,040
lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people so Hugh bot is a</font>

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,479
basically a chat robot you know

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,850
something similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's been going</font>

47
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,480
on in IRC<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another chat you know</font>

48
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,580
applications for years that originally

49
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,300
began just kind of as a way of doing

50
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:03,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">some really simple tasks at github it's</font>

51
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,500
since been built up and built up and

52
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,390
built up to the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our Ops guys</font>

53
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,878
refer to it as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important member</font>

54
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,620
of our operations team and ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up being</font>

55
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:15,370
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we deploy new</font>

56
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,439
servers to the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of hang</font>

57
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,670
out around the water cooler and share

58
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,410
funny pictures and things like that

59
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,809
it does have answers to give you it

60
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,780
doesn't necessarily learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> except that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

61
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:30,770
a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new actions for it</font>

62
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,620
and it can build<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon those so you know</font>

63
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,350
it essentially knows everything I as

64
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,150
developers we tell it it can do and and

65
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,079
it'll sometimes even with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

66
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprised you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

67
