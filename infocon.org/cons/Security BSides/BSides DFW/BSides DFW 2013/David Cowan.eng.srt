malware or a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we're solving</font>

is ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rollback transactions</font>

they're limited in their view they're

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,840
only capturing certain action so take

to do in as far as other operating

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,290
systems is see a more granular

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,300
perspective with all the changes that

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,070
are occurring if it touches<font color="#E5E5E5"> the disk so</font>

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,870
it provides us a much bigger window of

months worth of data of every file in

was up to what a piece of malware is

accessing if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure out</font>

crying favor idea of filtration this is

your best friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can go</font>

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is understand that the data exists</font>

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,220
so they have the ability and the

opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to look at it and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">then there's tools like ours and others</font>

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,950
out there how who can they can use the

majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that i know of</font>

right now we're free<font color="#CCCCCC"> early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free beta and</font>

38
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,420
they can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a better idea of</font>

39
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,799
the types of transactions and changes to

be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand kind of in a</font>

greater detail the actions are taking

<font color="#E5E5E5">place that can lead to a whole lot more</font>

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,369
have to weave I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> spending most of</font>

46
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,600
this year going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and speaking</font>

47

<font color="#E5E5E5">to get people aware of the fact that you</font>

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,229
can do it it's been such a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

49
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,000
enigma in the file<font color="#CCCCCC"> system for a long</font>

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,650
time where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people knew it's important</font>

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,299
they knew there's something in there but

52
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,920
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand it in parse it</font>

53
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,329
has been a much greater difficulty it's

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because this is a security</font>

audience mainly and I'm a forensics guy

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,579
who from a security background so I

57
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,100
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to understand what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

possible and that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font>

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,740
of get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the security bubble though</font>

60
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,969
there are some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting things</font>

61
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,250
that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of especially</font>

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">when they get involved in some types of</font>

response scenarios where they're dealing
