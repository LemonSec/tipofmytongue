both on the customer side and on the

common language with each other and they

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,299
they oftentimes will ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:25,550
the testing company will give them and

security have a very very high level of

knowledge on the tester side and a low

level of knowledge on the consumer side

11
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,050
so they're not actually getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font>

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,940
out of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> test all they're doing is</font>

reading a brochure and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,910
providers don't know how to provide the

service that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> selling I</font>

send 95 fishes 93 people click on it and

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,770
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> like yeah thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

metrics which gave him nothing like they

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,380
got nothing out of that the only thing

23
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,019
that they got is that your users will

24
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,430
click that's all that's the biggest

25
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,229
benefit they got and guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that</font>

26
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,729
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> always happen because clicking</font>

27
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:11,509
is the most fun part of using<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">computer the most fun thing that you can</font>

29
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:15,140
do there's nothing else more fun the

00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,298
clicking how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">kiddies click how do you get a</font>

32
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,109
funny video clinically right like

33
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,369
that's the most fun thing that you could

34
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:26,419
do so of course you're gonna click on a

35
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:28,039
good show but you gotta really<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,899
value right it should be testing all

37
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,670
sorts of stuff you should be testing

38
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,469
intelligence leakage based on how you

39
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,850
profile the company and what addresses

40
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,710
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get and how do you can find</font>

41
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,469
their org chart and who you can set it

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to specifically fish them</font>

documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had and you found</font>

48
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:53,479
the metadata and you realize they were

00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,889
using 97 instead of 2013 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're old</font>

school<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can just dump a macro</font>

51
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:59,568
that would run automatically like

00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:03,000
huge finding did you find it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your new</font>

fishing no didn't have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the bud</font>

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,650
so when companies normally will go

through and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire someone to do a</font>

fishing test<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes the metrics that</font>

57
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,730
they look for or around what users and

58
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,470
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> users clicked and that's</font>

59
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,179
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not providing them any value</font>

60
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,709
because we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a user is going</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer that's what they do so</font>

63
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,810
making security metrics around that is

64
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,190
irrelevant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security program users</font>

65
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">should definitely do fishing tests</font>

66
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,230
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives them the ability to</font>

67
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,550
expose multiple different layers and

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">test multiple different layers of the</font>

69

70
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,790
are oftentimes is not aware of all the

71
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,250
layers that should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> tested and the</font>

72
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,140
consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not realizing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

73
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,870
tester has the ability to test all those

74
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,109
levels I think the best message in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

75
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,110
of security is that experience provides

76
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,650
you the intelligence and the ability to

77
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,790
act in situations that are stressful and

78
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,310
when we're in stressful situations
