1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a few problems to say the</font>

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">least but but I think the biggest</font>

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is that we're focused as an</font>

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,470
organization too much on technology and

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,470
not so much on the people that use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,689
and we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how we tie</font>

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,689
together the human element of security

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,550
along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the technical parts we're</font>

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,010
still getting attacked we're still doing

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,320
all kinds of new technology next-gen

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,329
firewall red blinky box you know lights

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,340
whatever but we're still getting

13
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,199
attacked and they're still getting in

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,870
and they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in most of the time</font>

15
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:43,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the human</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> elements so we need to</font>

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,589
kind of change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that we look at</font>

17
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,109
the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> element of security it's</font>

18
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:51,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">really all about education so it's not</font>

19
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:53,089
so much about you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

20
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:56,569
that you need to use technology it's

21
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:58,370
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an awareness of their bad people</font>

22
00:00:56,569 --> 00:01:01,699
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these are some of the ways</font>

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,318
that they use to attack you so one of

24
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:06,530
the most successful things that I've

25
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:08,450
done recently with this is I had a

26
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,140
client that asked me to come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do a</font>

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:15,259
presentation for security day and you

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,630
know that's that's no problem and I

29
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:18,590
looked at last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year's schedule I said</font>

30
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,570
well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really don't have that</font>

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,159
good of a turnout<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i looked at last</font>

32
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">year's schedule and it was full of very</font>

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,920
official sounding briefings I know how

34
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,839
to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I put together a quick</font>

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,689
little just a presentation that's meant

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,340
for everybody and I called it how

37
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:37,070
hackers and scammers are stealing your

38
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,710
personal data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I filled it full of</font>

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,529
just security basics you know this is

40
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is how you identify phishing emails</font>

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,659
this is what you know something

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,850
suspicious looks like this is what a

43
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,920
card skimmer looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I've really</font>

44
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">tied everything around the people and</font>

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,009
how technology relates to them in their

46
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,559
personal lives and what happened was

47
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:02,840
that the room was so full that they had

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,100
standing room only around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge and</font>

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,159
then they finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to shut the room</font>

50
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:10,820
so when I was finished the organization

51
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,130
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizer came to me he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said how</font>

52
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">did you do it I said well how did i do</font>

53
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,079
but he said nobody comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these things</font>

54
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:19,800
how did you get them to show up I said

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,670
well I made it important

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,830
I didn't use the word required I didn't

57
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,480
use the word you know annual awareness

58
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,340
training you know that none of those

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,040
official phrases were involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,230
at all so I are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really taking that</font>

61
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,910
approach and just run with it it's more

62
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,100
about connecting with folks on a

63
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,950
personal level instead of dictating

64
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,200
policy definitely the first takeaway

65
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,170
that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to point out is you know</font>

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,179
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a people industry this industry</font>

67
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,369
revolves around people and it's not

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">about technology it's about how we pair</font>

69
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:59,280
them together point number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two feels so</font>

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,930
list oriented now it's really to defend

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,670
against social engineering attacks we

72
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">really need to explain to folks how they</font>

73
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,070
work so until you understand it well

74
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,680
enough to explain it you're not going to

75
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">be do a very good job with educating</font>

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,880
folks on how not to fall prey to these

77
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:22,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> third mmm third oh there's</font>

78
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:25,440
so many keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple and I win it when</font>

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,209
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to educating people it's not</font>

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a very splashy very complicated</font>

81
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,959
training method you need to do something

82
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">that grabs their attention conveys the</font>

83
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,110
message you want and that's it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

84
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,150
much like advertising so for folks that

85
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,190
they want to develop good twitter where

86
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,190
pneus training programs i recommend that

87
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">they start to look into advertising and</font>

88
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,000
talk to their marketing people because

89
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,000
it's all about just short<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sweet</font>

90
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,790
you
