1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,900
well the theme was you know instant

2
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:12,969
response the good the bad the ugly so

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,730
basically the bad parts of instant

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:17,380
response you know the good parts of it

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,939
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what can you do what can you do</font>

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,198
quickly then the ugly stuff what's

7
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:22,210
really happening out there in the

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,550
trenches and that's why I really like to

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,010
tell stories of engagements that I've

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,020
done and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,060
sense of wow this really does happen out

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,070
there and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't don't</font>

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,170
see that they miss it they can take

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,579
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I've talked about in</font>

15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the presentation whether it's</font>

17
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:43,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">emphasize so they can make their own I</font>

18
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:46,089
our team so much much better well my

19
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:48,370
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting story probably a data</font>

20
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:50,760
breach of a large casino the

21
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,559

basically and took<font color="#E5E5E5"> over their entire</font>

24
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:59,589

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">network I would say the whole network</font>

26
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:02,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the parts in the network that had</font>

27
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,750
to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the credit cards so it was</font>

28
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,950
almost like they had a playbook I mean

29
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,659
it's like they had the instruction

30
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,580
manual from the manufacturer of the

31
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:12,220
actual system I mean because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they went</font>

32
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:15,340
after very specific pieces of their

33
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,000
as400 infrastructure their point of sale

34
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,560
system their hotel management system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,100
they knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly when to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and get</font>

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,380
out so it was very very very well

37
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,280
coordinated that's for sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we got</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">some free tools do tool solve everything</font>

taking you longer than that there's

56
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:14,470
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong the biggest thing is</font>

57
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,599
just have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident response team or a</font>

58
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,670
plan because if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not prepared you</font>

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,429
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear prepare for this</font>

63
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,890
right our kids go to school they

64
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:30,108
practice fire drills are your

00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,578
never practice you know they do their

68
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">day-to-day job they might be a security</font>

00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:41,959
admin they might be a server admin they

70
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,429
might be a web developer where they

<font color="#E5E5E5">desk and most companies do not I'd say</font>

73
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:51,680
almost all companies do not bring their

74
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:54,169
I our teams together once<font color="#E5E5E5"> air quarter at</font>

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,700
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so they could practice and</font>

76
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:58,730
you know they should drill<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

77
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,819
anybody else drills I don't know I wish

78
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,578
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew I talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to people for years and</font>

79
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,980
I get the same response just the blank

80
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:08,299
look glaze is like what we're supposed

81
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,488
to practice this stuff but my guys

82
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,739
should know this you know tools that's

83
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,230
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest one is you go into an</font>

84
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,150
instant response and the company already

85
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,459
has some of the tools that maybe you

86
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,200
might recommend or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot and they</font>

87
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to use them because</font>

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,250
they're set setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on a shelf</font>

89
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,109
somewhere and they've never taken one

90
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,489
egg bottom they've got it put in the

91
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:31,069
budget they're like oh well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this</font>

92
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,199
forensics tool we need this<font color="#E5E5E5"> management</font>

93
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,478
tool and they either don't put them in

94
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,099
or they've never practice with them so

95
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,669
when the time comes if there's an

96
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,720
incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they're stuck because now</font>

97
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:43,129
they're having to open up the book

98
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,959
they're learning the software and

99
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:47,209
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna miss a lot of stuff um</font>

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,489
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of the shock at all you know</font>

101
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,569
they're initially shocked wow wow you

102
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,799
know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want that to happen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

103
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,048
how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen how do we prevent</font>

104
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">just that and my thing is I don't want</font>

105
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">to prevent just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's the everything</font>

106
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:00,109
else because your internet might not be

107
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:03,169
like the other ones it's just like when

108
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,659
we're doing pen testing we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

109
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:08,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at one scenario but that one</font>

110
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,918
exploit might not work so we re-engineer

111
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,419
it we come in a different door we might

112
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,579
have to do social engineering or what

113
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:16,220
not and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing with the</font>

114
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,870
attackers that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause your</font>

to have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident they're doing the</font>

116
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,478
same thing they're doing lots of

117
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,280
reconnaissance and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,229
at you multiple different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get in</font>

119
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,770
and if you're not if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have an</font>

you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> never build a respond to it</font>

122
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,729
you'll be flailing in the wind

123
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,430
you
