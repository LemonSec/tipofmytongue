00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,480
when we take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at organizations</font>

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,610
these days they<font color="#E5E5E5"> often do security</font>

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements and they have the best of</font>

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,369
intentions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,160
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it is that they're</font>

6
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:20,170
requiring so my presentation took a look

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,330
at the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements that have</font>

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,369
been put forward that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just abject</font>

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,769
failures from an actual implementation

10
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:29,109
standpoint saying things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the system</font>

11
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:33,430
shall be encrypted what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

12
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:35,200
or saying things like the system shell

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,930
and crypt password or hashed passwords

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,300
using AES 256 which is a contradiction

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,559
in terms in and of itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,300
I was taking a look at with required to

17
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,829
fail for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most part I tell people</font>

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,358
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually consult with</font>

19
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:47,320
their security engineers or security

20
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,750
personnel early in the development

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,859
process because that can really avoid a

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,719
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heartache in terms of</font>

23
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:55,300
implementation later on so there's a

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,670
belief i believe between software

25
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">developers or between program management</font>

26
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,449
that there's a base understanding of

27
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,010
security which translates into an

28
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:05,319
understanding of the actual technical

29
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,270
requirements and so what I'd really like

30
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,179
to see happen is that technical people

31
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,490
get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> early in the design process</font>

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,740
to sort of pinpoint those errors before

33
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,770
they occur and avoid costly<font color="#E5E5E5"> two down the</font>

34
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,770
road
