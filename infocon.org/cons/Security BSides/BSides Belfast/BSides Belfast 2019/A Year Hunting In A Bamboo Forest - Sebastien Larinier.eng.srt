1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,490
you

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,720
let's go thank you hello everyone thanks

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,250
to stay Jubilees is this late so my name

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,420
is Sebastian

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,210
it's my under on Twitter my name is

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,620
Robin i senior researcher at epitaph

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,910
ties an engineering school in paris

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,460
I create my society called the SCIF I

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,820
develop certain stuff open-source like

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,440
ET and first year I'm team on bahnhof

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,420
and on a web perfect

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,370
here is my github for all my stuff as I

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,300
developed I was devoted and my medium

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,960
with our article I wrote and you have a

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,540
different article about Chinese actors

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,420
Indian actors is different when I found

17
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:07,880
40 stork I walk about Chinese protectors

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,700
doing 1-1 years I tried to make links

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,880
between the difference Street actors

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,869
because many many founders on many CGI

21
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,020
society wrote article on on different

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,450
actors and I found some stuff about this

23
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,030
actors so I can I can make links between

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,580
between them I was the first guy to

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,520
reverse engineering the RTF 8 dot file

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,840
kids its exploit kids used by aesthetic

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,740
Chinese directors in space fishing is

28
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,939
document indicated argument in

29
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,040
attachments for spearfishing and with

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,508
exploitation from rock I make many many

31
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,840
links in difference straight title

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,019
Chinese and for me

33
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:22,290
is not the same group but yeah the they

34
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,450
are the same boss

35
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:31,769
so is interesting to to to to have to

36
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,590
have that idea in in this mine and I

37
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,049
have many many cutters are used between

38
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,219
the different actors with because many

39
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,019
other actors use specifically back doors

40
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,209
but in back doors you have different

41
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,540
function and the function is reused

42
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,489
between between back doors the first

43
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,079
detection is was an apathy in Vietnam

44
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:11,159
targeting a public administration in in

45
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,609
district in Vietnam I have this the

46
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:21,419
first this first detection I've just

47
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,180
analyzed sigh window group sigh winners

48
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,549
is Indian Street actors is known to

49
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,669
target is known to targets the Pakistan

50
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,819
and now it I get China so it is very

51
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,949
interesting and use an exploit on this

52
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,209
view is a exploit before the flow in a

53
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,370
question editor on on Microsoft Office

54
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,769
document and in this this exploit I

55
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,060
found this fingerprint so you have this

56
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,819
this string directly on on the exploit

57
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:14,310
and with this with this extra we see

58
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,399
strength I make a euros to make a

59
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,918
returned on on virustotal

60
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,529
and on virustotal I found many many many

61
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,950
many sample of this kit

62
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,110
so a little remember this view Avenue

63
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:41,760
variability on come object and this this

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,300
exhibit rent mathematic formula in of

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,910
his document the joke is Microsoft a

66
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,280
stolen the code of this eggsy because

67
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,230
this eggsy is too old so if you found a

68
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,470
vulnerability in in this in this exceed

69
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,950
its you are you're the king because

70
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,070
there's a new patch because then we

71
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,920
could sell and no source so it's very is

72
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,880
very fun and with the HTF format you can

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,680
put directly the oiler annoyingly object

74
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:31,680
with this as silly as say l e SI is his

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,300
numbers in in the registry to to say to

76
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,780
windows you call you just I realize the

77
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,250
object can become object with this eggsy

78
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,070
so you craft a specific specifically a

79
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,190
become object you put directly on the

80
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,320
RTF when you you do you click on the RTF

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,990
document zxz is exploit another i think

82
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,830
this XE is compare compiled without i

83
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,770
seller so it's open bar to create your

84
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:17,250
own exploit on this eggsy for example

85
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,490
you have an open source implementation

86
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,600
in Metasploit so you can you can emit a

87
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,470
sprite you can you can you can look

88
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,230
under you you see as a different

89
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,880
implementation and the first

90
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,420
implementation I've seen it just adorn

91
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,229
order of STI file to execute

92
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,949
execute STL file on the on the on the

93
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,300
computer the China's actors use this

94
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,849
exploit on Tibetan citizen directly with

95
00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:00,090
using the metal the metal preacher three

96
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,400
Chopra Georgie with which has pride

97
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,599
exploit Dirac sea I like I remember gun

98
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:12,629
Palestinian on the last the last few why

99
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,750
why Chinese used it releases this

100
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:22,789
Metasploit Metasploit exploit I think he

101
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:27,360
each try the try the exploit and if the

102
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,889
exploit works correctly and either the

103
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,130
exploit is reliable they the Chinese

104
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,780
actors complexify complexify the export

105
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:46,080
kit and I'll complete the computer I'll

106
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,389
make that is very simple in the RTF the

107
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:56,009
develop this from rock to to use

108
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,159
massively in different activity

109
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:09,569
operations you create eight pointy file

110
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:15,080
and you put directly on the document

111
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,719
when you make that you create by word a

112
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:24,110
new alloy package and another package as

113
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:33,149
as fortune allottee when you open the

114
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:36,200
document the oral package is directly

115
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,339
writen in the tan folder so you can you

116
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,140
can you can write easily on the disk

117
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,980
directly between the between the

118
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,490
documents and released when the

119
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,390
this file is put in the temp folder you

120
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,600
have an expectation of the before a flaw

121
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,110
- to put a shellcode in memory the

122
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,910
shellcode in memory decrypt this file in

123
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,370
memory and in memory is a result of this

124
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,020
description is a view format directly is

125
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,010
an exit and but in memory not on the

126
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,390
disk and in memory so execute this pair

127
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,000
is lunch and right on the disk or leg it

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,649
Benari signed in like a vast like simon

129
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:40,830
tag and a dll here is projects to make a

130
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:47,399
side loading and the shellcode exec the

131
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:55,170
legged binary - - to lunch and to map so

132
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,860
the ll in memory the malware is this

133
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:07,310
data on this on Vietnam we have the

134
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,380
director uses this domain and this

135
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,450
domain reserved on this IP I've a

136
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,180
connection between our all contain

137
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,830
described by fortunate and for fortunate

138
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,150
this campaign so you have a multi glue

139
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,180
graph if you if you want to read after

140
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,290
the different connection on the

141
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,520
campaign's and here you have the IOC

142
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,490
private between the between the

143
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,820
campaigns and for 440 net is goblin

144
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,540
Fonda Google fauna is known Chinese

145
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:58,880
actors with sing or one 1019 subset seen

146
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,100
at the beginning this actors begin to

147
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,730
target the t between citizen

148
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,980
so it's it's very very interesting the

149
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:22,000
road under the road of the Swiss actors

150
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,029
is that very very we start with easy

151
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,750
target and it complexify the operation

152
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,180
to target ministers of God in the south

153
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:43,660
of east southeast of Asia

154
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,360
it's it's an integer into the screen

155
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,209
shot so it's a payload and the payload

156
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,910
of this campaign is a Kris keynote Kris

157
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,949
keynote is a version of projects

158
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:07,389
modified and if you if but for for

159
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:14,069
fortunate on on Vietnam is new Conrad

160
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,610
was used but it's interesting because we

161
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,899
have we have we have an overlap of the

162
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,750
obvious for sister but not is not the

163
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:33,819
same the same back doors and you are and

164
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:40,050
I found of new Korat link an interesting

165
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,839
with this malware this malware is used

166
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,290
on the campaign in Vietnam in new karate

167
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,810
so is the same group like a goblin

168
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,740
goblin Paula and you have many you have

169
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,899
a big overlap with a b-1 and the

170
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:05,529
function the function of a rapid in this

171
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:10,630
case is a loading of the plugin of the

172
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,750
backdoor is the same techniques between

173
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:23,200
goblin and a PT one I've make I've made

174
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,639
I've made a ritual and on on this on

175
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,779
this back door

176
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,889
I found the SEMA similar with similar

177
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:39,670
with similar malware compiled in 208 so

178
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,070
it's it's before the link as a leak of

179
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,690
the ap1 so you have a big connection

180
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,990
between apps t1 and go Ben Gurion Paulo

181
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,760
why because when a p1 was doc seed the

182
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,160
developers are splitted in different

183
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,529
teams Chinese teams to to to another

184
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:13,089
group and goblin it's it's very very

185
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,019
interesting because we have many many

186
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:26,260
similar techniques of apps t1 and on

187
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:33,279
this case the this kit is unique is the

188
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,870
first many many people I've seen but I

189
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,040
was i I was the first guy to reverse it

190
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,829
and I decide to make an anything D

191
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:53,860
weekly on this kit not the not the back

192
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,839
doors why because I searched the top of

193
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,720
commander of the operation not the small

194
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,600
group I I want to know with which before

195
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,269
I spied as is both this exploit or if as

196
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,240
a child of the if the Chinese actress

197
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,490
who has developed this this exploit for

198
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,680
me I've no I've no evidence about that

199
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,290
but it's it's a society in China in

200
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,640
China as develop

201
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,980
as develop tomorrow and that's why we we

202
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,660
found this exploit on with the gap

203
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:51,310
fingerprint in in India and in China I

204
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,950
found I found only a link in Cambodia

205
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,640
with a PT 40

206
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,310
I've infrastructure and careers overlap

207
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,680
on the second campaign after the

208
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,750
campaign election against Cambodia we

209
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,149
are you have you have the first campaign

210
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,589
in election described by Phi I and this

211
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:25,160
campaign it just it just after and they

212
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:35,029
reused the same infrastructure so they

213
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,350
use bat flip of of malware

214
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,260
I put badly backflip on directly on on

215
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,980
on integer and I were up on canoes with

216
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:55,550
new Kohut so it's the same the three or

217
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,100
four function is a sandbar we're allies

218
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,440
Musa Yuko hot so it's the same

219
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,000
developers and the same the same TT fees

220
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,230
because they use the same kit and the

221
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,000
same functionality of back doors so you

222
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,900
have a PT 40 tempura script shared

223
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,869
infrastructure with goblin share code

224
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:24,470
with a PT 1 and you have bat flip

225
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,440
mukarat and crispy not like plugs in in

226
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,010
Russia I found the same the same kit and

227
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:42,169
I've a connection between between

228
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:47,230
infrastructure and sorry and

229
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,540
here the back door is this he's his

230
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,850
father his father is the back door like

231
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,810
plugs but is not developed develop it by

232
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,090
the same guy but you have you have the

233
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,970
same functionalities to list processes

234
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:14,020
least to make excitation to letter make

235
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,150
the lateral movement so it's the same

236
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,720
function but is not the same code for

237
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,490
fortunate this fighter and new car at

238
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,040
where developed by the same group goblin

239
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,330
Pune for me I don't know but we have a

240
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:38,250
mini mini link with this this actors I

241
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:45,870
found a link with River River is a

242
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:51,760
malware developed by Chinese actors and

243
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,070
we have on these actors we have

244
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,500
different overlap of the code readers

245
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,110
and of the infrastructure and

246
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,660
interesting interesting scene for rivers

247
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,840
goblin is associated with the MSS the

248
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,290
MSS is a Chinese intelligence services

249
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:25,240
for for silence unlike me the detector

250
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,760
the Chinese structures shared different

251
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:37,330
software like a PT 40 goblin and an ice

252
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,140
fog ively different Avex with with ice

253
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,430
phone ice fog is a Chinese apt actors

254
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:54,780
target Central Asia like Mongolia and

255
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,870
Kazakhstan but

256
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:06,440
iceberg I sense the exploit he the group

257
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,220
not exploit the same part of the code of

258
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,860
a question editor but target equation

259
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,408
editor he use the same

260
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,450
the same package an interesting

261
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,750
interesting thing he use a persistent of

262
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,460
Microsoft role because of fraud as a

263
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,850
start up folder and if you put a DLL or

264
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,179
on eggsy in these folders and you open

265
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:44,269
the document if you ever ever document

266
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,379
the DLL or the XE is executed by the

267
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:55,610
expectation system this DLL in instead

268
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,450
of follower contact the c2 and download

269
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:07,039
an exec a researcher of fire I Anna

270
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,440
Chang make a good a good overview on ice

271
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,649
fog and they use the same the same the

272
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,809
same techniques

273
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:25,549
the difference is during as time is a

274
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:28,149
backdoor Icefall change the back door

275
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:33,889
for depend on the target and the country

276
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:48,370
I found this in May 202 2019 and Phi I

277
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,350
make an article on this on this sample

278
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,759
adju is this sample target Kazakhstan

279
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,580
government the Defense Ministry of

280
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:13,560
Defence of the Kazakhstan gobelin

281
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,940
ponder and reuse the same kit of ice fog

282
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,960
so it changed the exploit but it keep

283
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,760
the RTF kid is the same is the same kid

284
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,850
but is not the same exploit and it

285
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:40,530
target Vietnam and with this campaign

286
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,620
I've many links with Hong Kong Hong Kong

287
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,960
is a site actor described by checkpoint

288
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:54,240
and it targets Cambodia Vietnam all of

289
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:02,130
the South East of Asia it's a decoy

290
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,640
document and it's the same is the same

291
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,550
target you have here it's a goblin

292
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,620
document and it's Ronco document and

293
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,000
here is the same the same name like here

294
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,720
so is exactly the same target in the

295
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,020
dacoit documents this is the ATF was

296
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,640
pre-printed and in the screen when you

297
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:37,590
when you open the document here is the

298
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,250
article of checkpoint at here it's my my

299
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,300
article and make makes a checkpoint make

300
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,850
a link in in my article on this campaign

301
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:57,150
with with integer I found a big big

302
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,690
overlap of goblin ponder on on this

303
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,690
sample so I I've linked between GTP's

304
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,200
like like like it

305
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,760
and the backdoor is very similar of nuke

306
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,649
nuke Oh hot

307
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:26,110
and finally I found a link with Winton

308
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:33,409
always in Vietnam with the same the same

309
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:37,700
kid and the back doors are different or

310
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,179
a back door or back door is used by

311
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:46,600
windy but not wind is an umbrella

312
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,749
umbrella award for for Chinese Chinese

313
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:53,769
group for me

314
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:00,100
there are many many different groups who

315
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:05,149
for example guys wants to to target

316
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:09,320
video games wants to target supply chain

317
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,919
like a zoos or under some are well or

318
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,070
completely different you have root kit

319
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,070
you have side loading you have partial

320
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,210
so it's for me it was this group it's

321
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,999
now it's stupid you you must divide in

322
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:33,440
in small groups and in this one of small

323
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,090
groups I've developed a backdoors and

324
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,399
this background is used in just in

325
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:45,970
Vietnam and I work with law enforcement

326
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,379
in the time and true to explain how the

327
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:55,909
burglars walks the different the

328
00:25:55,909 --> 00:26:00,109
different logs and evidence you can find

329
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:05,269
on on forensics operation because many

330
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,070
many

331
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,919
people on the an administration as

332
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:23,139
target but by this backdoor so for me

333
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:24,710
all groups

334
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,769
I was I described

335
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,600
a link with the MSS for me

336
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,860
the MSS bulks they exploit and after the

337
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:45,409
exploit was was shared directly in

338
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:49,970
different in different threat actors

339
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,039
group the operation and the common man

340
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,049
the this following operation to follow

341
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,950
in action during operation or the same

342
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,330
and the the I've the same the same boss

343
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:13,960
to describe and to write the operation

344
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,929
to target the South the South East of

345
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,870
Asia and Central Asia why because this

346
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,990
this place is very very important for

347
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:32,840
China because many many countries are

348
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,059
used by the New Silk Road of of China so

349
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:45,260
China as an inn and interests Street

350
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,179
strategic interest to spy and to make

351
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:58,309
many surveillance directly on this on

352
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:07,190
these countries or our links are the

353
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,590
different the different reference I use

354
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,250
on my my different findings on these

355
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,779
different different compounds of these

356
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:27,529
actors so far the following research is

357
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:39,010
to to demonstrate they to to politics of

358
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,090
off cybersecurity operation

359
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:49,560
used in use in this south south of East

360
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,130
of Asia and Central Asia and and also

361
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,300
actors like a PT 10 or looky mouse for

362
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:03,840
author country like Japan like United

363
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,530
States because I've no overlap code or

364
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:14,190
infrastructure between this kind of this

365
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:20,120
kind of group so you have to politics

366
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:26,720
organization sync operation differently

367
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,260
between this is this this country and

368
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,910
for me and Felix said said that for

369
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,600
during this presentation

370
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,670
they said they make they made the

371
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,210
training of the south east of Asya and

372
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,340
after the group these groups you target

373
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,700
another country like Japan or Russia or

374
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:08,610
United States it's over if you have a

375
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:14,449
