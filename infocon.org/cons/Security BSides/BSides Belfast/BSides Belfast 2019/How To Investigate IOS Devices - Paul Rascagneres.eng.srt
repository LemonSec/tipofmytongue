1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,530
yeah

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,370
so yeah I cannot speak with that so I

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,280
need to take it off so yeah thank you

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,429
thank you for the introduction and yeah

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:15,679
I'm gonna speak about about iOS

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,890
investigation so just a few seconds so I

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,450
need to speak to remove all the cable on

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,660
me so about me short introduction my

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,660
name is Paul I like to to reverse

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,238
malware and to to bite to read stuff

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,350
like this stuff I did it by myself so

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,420
you've got a picture of me when I had to

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,350
reverse Delphia vb binary or when I

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,859
create this kind of mask and I work at

15
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:49,579
Cisco tell us for three years I think

16
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,420
now mainly work on value analysis apt

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,159
actors and stuff like that

18
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,649
I work on the Turkish so this morning

19
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:01,510
about DNS panache see total Exeter extra

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,909
so just a statement about my torque just

21
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,000
now I will speak about iOS not about iOS

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,909
so if you expect the torque about the

23
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,520
Cisco patek system it's not the purpose

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,070
of my talk I will just pick about the OS

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,299
developed by Apple on iPhone iPod iPad

26
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,409
devices so if if you expected something

27
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,450
else you can change the room of three

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,500
you have two tracks I won't give you an

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,890
easier day on iOS because if I had every

30
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,700
day I would be really rich and not here

31
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,520
and I'm not a big expert on iOS stuff so

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,369
I touch my first iPhone a little bit

33
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,490
more than one year ago so I'm really

34
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,000
newbie on this on this domain I'm not

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,679
involved on jailbreak community so I'm

36
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,859
not develop Jade bike or stuff like that

37
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:02,479
my my goal was we have to work on some

38
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,499
investigation on iPhone devices and I

39
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:07,380
was

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,750
oscar's if you try to find documentation

41
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,040
on google like how to do forensic how to

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,550
analyze Marwin iOS iphone and stuff like

43
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,180
that you don't find any stuff you find a

44
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,989
lot of stuff about protection about how

45
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,970
work the last jailbreak however the last

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,540
video hability of this device and you

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,890
can find this kind of stuff no problem

48
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,709
but if you want to from the defense

49
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,900
point of view and from Z I've got some

50
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,910
suspicious about this device and I would

51
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,530
like to investigate if something is

52
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,870
wrong you don't really have a lot of

53
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,160
documentation because you know as

54
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,680
malware does not exist on iphone you

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,290
don't need documentation so that was

56
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,690
that the purpose of my Turk is more

57
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,599
about a feedback about how I work what

58
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,360
kind of tool I used what limitation I

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,950
have when I have to work on on iOS

60
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,709
device etc so small agenda I will really

61
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,780
really quickly introduce use the iOS

62
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,049
architecture because it could take hours

63
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,180
to speak about how it works but simply

64
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,530
to give you a small overview and and you

65
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,030
will be able to understand the rest of

66
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,420
the presentation I will have a part

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,790
about jay bike because jailbreak is part

68
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,480
of the system I will explain you why you

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,370
should or you should not share bike your

70
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,260
phone and the limitation of the in fact

71
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,769
the limitation imposed by Apple when you

72
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,010
have to do forensic and and how to

73
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,560
bypass this limitation by using a jet

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,209
bike I will present you the tool I use

75
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,450
so no matters it's very common tools but

76
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,420
I will explain you how I use on my

77
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,660
specific context which was iPhone

78
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,560
analysis and after I will much explain

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,799
you how attackers can deploy my malware

80
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,239
on on iOS devices it's based on real

81
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,450
case so I don't I will not show you

82
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,298
something new but something they

83
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,389
already used for for couple of years and

84
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,270
finally I will show you from a malware

85
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,909
analysis point of view what malicious

86
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:28,569
developer can do on the malicious upon

87
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,729
malicious iOS application because it's

88
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,289
not like on Windows system you cannot

89
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,830
make the injection of remote process

90
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,930
pass the memory to finder I don't know

91
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,610
critical number or whatever it's

92
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,810
technically impossible on an iOS devices

93
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,659
so I will show you what we saw what

94
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:50,770
really exists and you will see even with

95
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,669
a limited feature provided by Apple on

96
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,490
this domain attackers can make some

97
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,759
offender stuff so first things are us

98
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,099
architecture so it's a unique system so

99
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:10,990
I hope can have directly terminal having

100
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,960
classic come on like LSPs extra you have

101
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,949
file system you it's really a unique

102
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,159
system very close to Mac OS UNIX system

103
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,560
you have several layer like every

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,110
operating system you've got the user on

105
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,050
where the application is executive

106
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,940
you've got a couple of framework to help

107
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,110
developers to develop iOS application

108
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,969
but you have private framework it's

109
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:42,159
framework used by the operating system

110
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,729
but the developers don't have access to

111
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,319
this framework you cannot develop your

112
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,879
application and say yeah I want to use

113
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,599
this private framework no it's closed

114
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,270
and you don't have access to that you

115
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,250
can develop your application in a swift

116
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,909
or objective-c you have a lot of party

117
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:03,180
library for example iOS really love

118
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,699
SQLite database so more less everything

119
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,900
is an SQLite database on the device so

120
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,940
you need the library to be able to read

121
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,389
this this database so they provide

122
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:19,659
library almost everything from a

123
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,750
configuration point of view is an XML so

124
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,520
you have a library to pass XML

125
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,419
configuration file and stuff like that

126
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,660
and after you have all the library for

127
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,729
memory management and sandbox cause

128
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,970
every application where your phone is

129
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,569
block inside of a sandbox so they

130
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,889
developed the library to manage his

131
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,819
sandbox and finally you have the camp so

132
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,800
it's really classical layers the only

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,169
big difference between that and a Linux

134
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,270
system if you wish is everything is very

135
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,819
separated and you only have access to

136
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,099
the libraries that Apple decided you

137
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:05,400
will have access for your application so

138
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,630
Apple does a lot of effort to provide a

139
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,030
secure operating system so they put a

140
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,080
lot of different layers to block access

141
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,960
to a really important part of the

142
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,000
operating system they think you don't

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,460
need to have access a first thing for

144
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,469
example you cannot be root you cannot

145
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:28,150
have a root account on your phone it's

146
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,580
it's not possible you cannot have the

147
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,419
UID 0 you don't have a direct access to

148
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,509
the filesystem you cannot go on /tmp

149
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:39,610
slash whatever it's it's technically not

150
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,900
not possible when you have an

151
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,210
application they create a file system

152
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,370
for the application you can go inside of

153
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,090
your directory but that's all you cannot

154
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,069
go on directory of other application and

155
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:55,090
you cannot go on the system slash you

156
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,889
USA or stuff like that it's not possible

157
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,990
you have a vector file system for your

158
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,590
application

159
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,930
I said that as I mentioned every

160
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,550
application is executed inside of a

161
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,860
sandbox is related from the other

162
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,610
application the slash the hood file

163
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,400
system is in the feed only so even if

164
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,009
you find a way to escape the sandbox and

165
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,139
you find a way to become out you cannot

166
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,479
modify the file system it's in a hidden

167
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,539
nation and finally you have cut signing

168
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,550
your application must be sign correctly

169
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,279
to be executed it it's not like on

170
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,679
Microsoft Microsoft you should be slide

171
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,240
that if you're not sign it's not a big

172
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,429
issue here is if you are not signed by a

173
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,380
good certificate you cannot executor

174
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,090
binary it

175
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,690
easy so it's very good from a security

176
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,540
point of view see I had so many layer of

177
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,000
securities and it's really complicated

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,140
too to be able to become route make a

179
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,170
bad application become route put a

180
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,089
malware on the file system extra it's

181
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,850
something very very complicated so from

182
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,920
the security point of view and my point

183
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,430
of view it's it's a lot of good choice

184
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,260
but the limitation is when you want to

185
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,510
do forensic analysis when you have a

186
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,360
phone you know it's compromised for

187
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,250
whatever reason and you say okay I would

188
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,630
like to check what happen on my phone

189
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,130
because you will have all this

190
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,529
limitation for you even if you're a good

191
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,080
guy and you want to do something

192
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,490
positive that's why I will speak about

193
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:33,630
gel bike is it monetary or not so this

194
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,790
is young 12 is yes you need to jail back

195
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:42,480
to your device to work for for example

196
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,490
you you you can imagine you have a

197
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,800
devices you know it's a malicious

198
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,740
application because I don't know it was

199
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,740
downloaded somewhere or it was not here

200
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,540
and you wake up one morning and a new

201
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,820
application you have a big suspicious

202
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,690
it's not normal if it's technically

203
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,510
impossible to get the application so

204
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,670
file system subjectively was the

205
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,010
application the binary code is stored on

206
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,060
the device is not reachable you cannot

207
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,930
access to this repository you can access

208
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,100
to the data but not to the binary so if

209
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,480
you do a backup of your phone for

210
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,640
example he will back up all your data so

211
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,050
if you have a new phone you will restore

212
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,190
the data but on the Apple philosophy you

213
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,930
don't need a backup of the binary

214
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,360
because the binary will be back from the

215
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,370
store later when you install a new phone

216
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,430
so you don't need to backup the binary

217
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,510
so you don't have access to the binary

218
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,260
it's something new this limitation

219
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,760
appears on iOS 8 it's possible to damage

220
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,070
the memory as you are located inside of

221
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,280
a sandbox

222
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,650
you could imagine I can dump the memory

223
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,410
of my sandbox but not the memory of also

224
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,020
process it's not possible

225
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,910
you can Adams a disk as I explained you

226
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,840
are limited to the data that allow you

227
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,620
to have access for example if you want

228
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,440
to debug an application if you already

229
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,100
have the application you can modify the

230
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,620
application and delegate on a device

231
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,500
without jailbreaking the device if you

232
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,420
don't have the application before it's

233
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,650
impossible it's limited by by a pair of

234
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:36,180
security so let's speak about J bike

235
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,580
what is a jailbreak is a couple of

236
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,100
vulnerabilities that hello you to have a

237
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,780
root of full access to the device so

238
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,250
imagine I describe you a lot of

239
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,490
protection just here so when you execute

240
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,940
a jet bike it means it's an application

241
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,680
that have a vulnerability on the camel

242
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,580
that hello to executive I that trick to

243
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,680
rename the file system in it right in

244
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,630
order to drop something in this file

245
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,300
system bypass the signatures and you

246
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,530
finally have a jailbreak so today the

247
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,839
application I list here do all these

248
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,150
tasks for you but it's it's a lot of

249
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,860
different tasks and it's a lot of

250
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,180
different combined exploit a weakness to

251
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,180
to achieve this this pass so today we

252
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,820
are able to jet bike from an OS point of

253
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,460
view all the version until 12.4 so if

254
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,070
z/os is more recent

255
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,890
if you the people that own the phone you

256
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,150
want to analyze is up to date you cannot

257
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,970
get by the phone I will explain you some

258
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,670
some new stuff just attack so for for up

259
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,620
to date device you only have two

260
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,960
solutions the first one is to ping

261
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,720
celebrate and be prepared to pay a lot

262
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,840
of money

263
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,820
and this second solutions are more

264
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,290
realistic if you don't have a lot of

265
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,560
money is to freeze the phone to stop the

266
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,210
phone to put effect profile for example

267
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,770
you can say on your device

268
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,920
no in fact I'm not an iPhone I'm a purty

269
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,330
and by doing that you block the update

270
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,630
system of Apple and wait for the next

271
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,490
gen back you don't have other solutions

272
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,980
and wait for Jade white if you want to

273
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,260
perform a forensic investigation on the

274
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,170
device or get install application or

275
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,200
whatever if you want to create a lab

276
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,120
course you want to practice before

277
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,190
having a big big issue it's always

278
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,810
better trust me you would like a phone

279
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,940
that you can jet bike you would like a

280
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,520
specific version because you don't want

281
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,730
to have a iOS 13 and you cannot

282
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,320
jailbreak it you need to wait for the

283
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,029
next winner ability and at this time it

284
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:57,740
will be able to J bike extracts fat so

285
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,920
you will last a lot of time the best way

286
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,000
I have for you is in fact you would I

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,120
did it you will look like a little bit

288
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,200
crazy but it works when you come to shop

289
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,820
you take the second number on the box

290
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,400
and based on the cell number you can

291
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,230
guess the date of the creation of the

292
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,570
phone when his II was gold from the

293
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,660
factory and based on this date you can

294
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,670
guess with which operating system is

295
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,089
installed on the phone for example here

296
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,320
if you have a second number that start

297
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,680
by something w w something and cccc it

298
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,620
means it was create on the first half of

299
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,990
2018 on the week twenty five that means

300
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,330
it's probably installed this version of

301
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,180
iOS and the phone the only stuff is when

302
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,910
you go on tour and you say yeah I would

303
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,160
like an iPhone X with a second number

304
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,650
with when the third and fourth number

305
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,320
are a and C he looks like a little bit

306
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,150
William but

307
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,839
finally if you pay the guys okay and

308
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,030
that's how I'm sure I have this specific

309
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,440
iOS version on my

310
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,620
device and and I can jet bike it so you

311
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,780
know the solution is to go on eBay a lot

312
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,510
of guy blog the update and try to set it

313
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,380
on on eBay

314
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,080
but it's expensive and this

315
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,910
technique is you pay the real price of

316
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,160
the phone not double like you can see on

317
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,390
on eBay

318
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,130
so the website is this get at our

319
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,550
website if you want to to not and it

320
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,640
automatically give you more less iOS

321
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,190
version instant on all the device you

322
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,960
want to buy yeah so few weeks ago

323
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,830
something changed on the jailbreak stuff

324
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,950
so a vulnerability was released named

325
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,070
checkmate and it changed the game

326
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,810
so someone from the vulnerability on the

327
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,500
film web part of the device so he found

328
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,570
the vulnerabilities somewhere on the

329
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,870
device or where Apple is not able to

330
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,010
patch so today all the phone from my

331
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,040
iphone if I take iPhone but same thing

332
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,870
for all the I device iPhone 8 2 X all

333
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,090
this device have in the hub to checkmate

334
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,700
and all this device can be patched

335
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,720
because it it's hardware venerability

336
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,050
and it's on the on the chip inside of

337
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,850
the phone and it cannot be patched by

338
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,910
Apple what is this vulnerabilities is

339
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,750
variability

340
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,790
he's on the iboot I boot is how C iPhone

341
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,210
boot

342
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,810
it's the cut that will take your OS and

343
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,120
load the u.s. in memory and start cos

344
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,480
why it's big change the I boot is a part

345
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
that checks the signatures of the

346
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,030
operating system it means we have a

347
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,670
vulnerability in high boot that we allow

348
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,209
you to boot not correctly signed iOS

349
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,780
operating system so it's not a jet bike

350
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,480
it simply you have the control of how

351
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,480
your device boot and you can modify the

352
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,829
boot you

353
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,630
modify the memory and say I want to get

354
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:34,350
in Depok you can normally load on a lot

355
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,910
of people starting to boot very old

356
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,220
version of iOS which is impossible

357
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,400
because when a prolific certificate

358
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,190
you cannot boot old version anymore you

359
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,970
need to have the latest version of iOS

360
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,470
and you cannot downgrade for example

361
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,360
it's not supported you can downgrade a

362
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,690
phone but with this venerable et you can

363
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,280
bypass the check and say I want to

364
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,559
downgrade my my device and it works so

365
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,720
it's really a game changer from Jerry

366
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,950
bike community point of view and another

367
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,040
group of people starting to write a

368
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,100
jailbreak named Jacqueline that use the

369
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,309
checkmate vulnerability and the biggest

370
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,240
change is as we are speaking about

371
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,360
Hardware vulnerability you can get back

372
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,480
any version of iOS even the last one

373
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,720
because it's modified before the load of

374
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,049
the operating system so no you have Jade

375
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,350
back on OS point of view two days the

376
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,880
last one is 12.4 and you have j back

377
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,140
from hardware point of view from 8 to x

378
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,220
so we that's all in the past it was a

379
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,929
little bit complicated but no we it's

380
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,640
more complicated because it depend of

381
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,360
the art where and and stuff like that so

382
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,720
yeah I'm gonna try to show you I'm not

383
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,970
sure it's gonna work as the expert is

384
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:06,630
not when on 100% stable so yeah

385
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,910
something for this exploit that I read a

386
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,650
lot of bad news papers that say

387
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,059
it's part of our life I know

388
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:19,800
so some newspaper explain yeah I don't

389
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,040
choose a random charger for for your

390
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,540
phone causes they can use this

391
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,059
vulnerability blah blah blah there's a

392
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,910
vulnerability only works in GF humored

393
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,820
it means in the rest of mod so you met

394
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,860
two you must switch off your phone sorry

395
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,250
and once your phone is switched off

396
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,000
you must put in in GF u which means you

397
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
must push a level down and click on the

398
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,740
button so there is a power button and

399
00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:11,610
normally I have in GF u let's try it fed

400
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,700
let's try again so yeah if you use a

401
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,740
your ubirr cable except if you reboot to

402
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,540
switch in DFU mode X right it cannot

403
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,679
choose checkmate on on your phone so

404
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
don't be paranoid but if someone have

405
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,270
physical access to your phone yes you

406
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:51,570
can do it I'm not in good mood anyway I

407
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,510
don't eat even if I want to I've got

408
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,260
some issue to to put in GF u so

409
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,960
basically the purpose is you boot in GF

410
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,020
u you use the exploit and you have gdb

411
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,470
sort of classical debugger on your I

412
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,840
boot and you can debug step by step it's

413
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,660
a bit of your operating system you can

414
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,690
modify memory you can modify a fatty

415
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,570
stuff at you like a common debugger so

416
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,160
it's it's really useful if you want to

417
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,280
understand how boot and iOS and it's

418
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
also very useful if you want to modify

419
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,500
the boot

420
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,730
behavior for the moment it's only in

421
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,890
memory so it doesn't bike your phone you

422
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,500
know so expect modify memory and and

423
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,049
that's all but something you can do is

424
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,650
to overwrite see I put and put your own

425
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,770
bootloader yes in this case you could

426
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,340
break your device anyway

427
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,679
let's come back on Mahalaya analysis and

428
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,780
and stuff like that first thing if you

429
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,710
want to decompile Jesus um an

430
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,080
application ID up whole you give you

431
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,070
good results but it's expensive and

432
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,990
today we have two alternative really

433
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,510
good one the first one is hopper you

434
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,360
need to pay that it's like 100 euro it's

435
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,450
not very expensive or even today you can

436
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,650
use Gita and get a perfectly support

437
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,860
objective-c or Swift code so it's you

438
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,970
have a free alternative today to do so

439
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,130
so yeah something a little bit

440
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,380
complicated when you start is everything

441
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,260
is an object it's how it works

442
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,659
iOS device so you have like a lot of

443
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,850
object and you don't really have a clear

444
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,970
workflow so if you are used to reverse C

445
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,000
+ space you are won't be shocked but if

446
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,470
you're not it could be a little bit

447
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,760
complicated at the beginning and

448
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,429
everything is based on event so an event

449
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:52,809
an action an event an action yeah some

450
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,130
example here we we have a class name

451
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,549
with SF you can see not know if my yeah

452
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:06,000
Web SF had a method name web LD a link

453
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,390
web download in this case and those are

454
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,140
very very useful tools is Frida Frida is

455
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,740
the tool for for doing dynamic

456
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,650
instrumentation so it's like a debugger

457
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,780
but for example you can make some really

458
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,580
interesting stuff like when you go in a

459
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,640
specific function method you can get the

460
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,700
argument when you go out you can get the

461
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,340
output so the result of the function

462
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,740
and it can be really useful if you don't

463
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,450
understand the function you can at least

464
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,820
check what kind of argument he's at

465
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,330
geometry and what kind of stuff go out

466
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,330
of the out of the method here is an

467
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,900
example so I take use the same method so

468
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,110
web SF and web something download and

469
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,030
I've got a cryptid data here so yeah you

470
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,190
can in this specific case you could do

471
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,900
it statically it's not free complex but

472
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,630
it just for for the example so you have

473
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,300
you want L on the function it do some

474
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,160
magic description and you have a value

475
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,910
at the end you can do it with Freda so I

476
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,220
simply say I want to attach to this

477
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,350
specific method I want on and I'd say

478
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,870
okay I'm inside of the method and when I

479
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,550
go on the live I print the value of the

480
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,970
object and here you can see I'm inside

481
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,160
of the function here is the output of

482
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,620
the function so you can see it's a URL

483
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,900
the purpose of this function is to treat

484
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,930
a c2 server Johanna

485
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,910
so using frida can be really useful if

486
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,530
you want to automate I make some

487
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,060
ultimate decision about this kind of

488
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,810
stuff

489
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,030
another approach could be to do it

490
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:02,000
directly on the US framework so each

491
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,580
time I use ul method so provided by

492
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,280
Apple I check the argument and I display

493
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,260
the argument so sure I can directly have

494
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,040
the domain because each time the Murat

495
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,380
tried to connect to CC to server I will

496
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,960
display so c2 server so it's very

497
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,760
convenient to use a theta for this kind

498
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,560
of task yes the only big issue on Frieda

499
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,400
is the only support JavaScript don't ask

500
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,170
me why you haven't achieved debugger

501
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:40,520
provided by Apple name ll DB it's really

502
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,280
close to gdb so if you are used to to

503
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,700
use gdb could be interesting for you

504
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,330
to be honest I don't

505
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,430
I think it's pretty hard to read the

506
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,680
syntax is mystic and and I don't like it

507
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,930
but I I did exactly the same thing Black

508
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,010
Point at the specific method shows it is

509
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,650
a summary card like point at the end get

510
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,050
the value at the end I I've got my URL

511
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,770
so it's exactly the same approach but

512
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,110
but yeah I think it's over complicated

513
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,250
compared to Frida but it was someone

514
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,360
just stuff you can use you have freedom

515
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,020
which is a street that them is a memory

516
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,300
of the current process so it dump the

517
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,310
memory during the execution and you can

518
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,890
check the generated things and in this

519
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,630
case for example you will have the URL

520
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,210
directly in memory and you can directly

521
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,980
get it from the memory dump it can be an

522
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,230
interesting approach something else you

523
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,120
can do and you should do if you analyze

524
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,060
iOS device is to listen on the network

525
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,580
how I work on at home I got my phone

526
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,640
I've got a hooter dedicated to research

527
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,510
and I've got a verb and the pickup so

528
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,610
I'm able to have a full pickup during my

529
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,340
analysis if I need to to replay it or if

530
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,190
I want to check the communication and if

531
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,950
you choose HTTP which is almost all the

532
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,030
time today I use verb and I do

533
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,950
man-in-the-middle with my own

534
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,820
certificate

535
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,890
I trust the certificate on my phone and

536
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,500
I'm able to have all the HTTP requests

537
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,170
it's not dedicated to iOS you can do

538
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,000
that on Windows it's the same idea but

539
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,230
really do that have a pickup and an

540
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,990
HTTPS man-in-the-middle interception

541
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,890
HTTP interception and to be honest use

542
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,830
gone to the supermarket buy the cheapest

543
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,150
hotel you can find but choose a

544
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,480
dedicated Rooter to avoid noise on your

545
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,170
pickup for example only the phone you

546
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,570
analyzed on the hotel and that's all

547
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,740
that's how I work

548
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,320
so Marvel deployments we speak about

549
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,630
malware how to analyze malware we speak

550
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,490
about jailbreak we speak about a lot of

551
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,680
stuff but how the articles deploying

552
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,710
malware for iOS you don't have a

553
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,050
thousand of combination you are really

554
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,510
limited on the method from my point of

555
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,140
view and and you must understand how

556
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,520
works an application on iOS so first

557
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,380
thing cut signing the application this

558
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,200
beside must be signed by a developer

559
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,900
certificate so birth certificate you can

560
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,090
have a developer certificate you pay 100

561
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,860
euro at Apple she will give you a

562
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,540
certificate and after you manage your

563
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,580
certificate with a web page and you sign

564
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,510
your application it's it's free easy to

565
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,520
do a great job to have something very

566
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,290
convenient because everybody knows

567
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,300
certificate is a big you are always

568
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,850
lost about the type of certificate where

569
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,950
you need to put it extra extra and here

570
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,710
it's automatically done by by Apple it's

571
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,750
really really nice yeah yeah you have

572
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,480
different kind of certificate almost all

573
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,060
the case I work on is they use a doc

574
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,680
certificate which is an adult

575
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,360
certificate when you are developer and

576
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,730
you are developing an application you do

577
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,740
not want to put it on the store because

578
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,240
you don't want people don't load your

579
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,090
application it's under development so

580
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,820
something you can do is create an

581
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,950
application and inside the certificate

582
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,160
you say this application only work for

583
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,210
this specific device based on the UID so

584
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,760
each device has a unique ID and you say

585
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,500
ok the application side for this

586
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,160
specific device almost all the time

587
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,890
as a malware I saw use the same approach

588
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,670
other certificates yeah there is an

589
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,810
example of of developer certificate

590
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,870
name comma rich Universal Academy and

591
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,750
it's installed a fake Instagram

592
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,380
application in a habbit language so it's

593
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,180
an example of a certificate

594
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,580
if you look at the application the

595
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,800
Arabic Instagram application here you

596
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,680
can see it's an addict and you have the

597
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,960
UID of the targeted devices how you get

598
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,990
a UID but you can get it on the phone

599
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,550
directly and if you don't have access to

600
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,610
the phone you can create a fake a web

601
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:20,150
page and by using profile you can get

602
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,730
the you idea of the people that go on

603
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,040
the website you must have a user

604
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,750
interaction it's not magic

605
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,180
so you have a pop-up on your iPhone

606
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,980
saying someone would like to go to get

607
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,750
your idea you sure you want to give your

608
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,050
ID

609
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,000
everybody click yes because it's easier

610
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,330
and and the Atticus Ozzy is the idea of

611
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:43,210
the house the device you have a police

612
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,920
file inside of each applications that

613
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,290
gives a UID and just mention for example

614
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,900
and you need to set up a minimal OS

615
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,340
version and up name for example

616
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,980
Instagram or whatever so that's

617
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,780
basically how works an application

618
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,180
policed such as a minimal requirement

619
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,720
and you sign your binary and the

620
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,790
application with a developer certificate

621
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,480
for for that for the deployment for

622
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,780
example you have MDM so mobile device

623
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,880
management so we don't if I'm malicious

624
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,840
MDM some MDM maintained by bad guys with

625
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,960
few register phone on the MDM with not

626
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,700
at this time how the phone was purchased

627
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,880
from the MDM we have to eat but this is

628
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,490
so first one is social engineering you

629
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,200
call the guy explained you ask support

630
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,180
from Apple and you should do that that

631
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,180
or whatever all the other approaches

632
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,980
they have a physical access to the phone

633
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,330
with a physical access to the phone its

634
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:53,780
22nd to on the whole device on MDM show

635
00:31:53,780 --> 00:32:01,450
you just one second

636
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,810
it's

637
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,190
[Music]

638
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:15,399
I don't know if it works

639
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:28,070
yeah next time I will write system yeah

640
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,399
so you have the device and you which is

641
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,279
a number of interaction you need from

642
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,559
the users point of view to unwhole the

643
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,259
device on the MDM it's a lot of

644
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:51,710
direction so so first you need to

645
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:58,370
download the profile he writes said to

646
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,750
you yeah you are trying to open a

647
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,730
profile are you sure your is a profile

648
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,450
you need to install the profile it's on

649
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,509
Holling you have a whopping inverse to

650
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:12,590
tread certificate so it's a lot of of

651
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,919
steps to turn also you cannot do it very

652
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,710
by accident you need to yeah very good

653
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,409
social engineering or physical access to

654
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:28,450
the device so if you wait a little bit

655
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,009
what will be the first task of the MDM

656
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:43,960
take few second few Lopes a note yeah

657
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,490
installation so by device management

658
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,549
manager is able to deploy application on

659
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,799
all the whole device it's exactly what

660
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,769
do company you have an iPhone you want

661
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:57,379
all your phone on your you're quite MDM

662
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,929
and after your company is able to deploy

663
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:01,759
internal application on your phone it's

664
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,320
its main purpose of MDM in this case you

665
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,329
can see to to whatsapp application

666
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:11,060
instead the real one and the malicious

667
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:17,839
one if if you want to check on your

668
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,030
device yeah you can go directly on on

669
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,909
the device on settings you go on the

670
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:29,690
bottom and you have device management

671
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,780
country where you have all the servers

672
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,460
that can manage your phone it's very

673
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,929
easy if you don't have the menu it means

674
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:38,149
you don't have any you are not on hold

675
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:41,569
on on an MDM a participe hide the menu

676
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:42,909
if it's not relevant

677
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:46,399
yeah so the other way to install

678
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,219
application is to use your day but it's

679
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,500
really expensive it's really limited to

680
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,699
two specific actors we saw what's up VIN

681
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,700
ability a few two weeks ago so it's

682
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,670
exist but it's a hard way to do it but

683
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,859
it's a more silent way to do it so it

684
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:08,900
depend on the actors of the money of the

685
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,390
actors of the skills of the actors but

686
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,550
it's a way to do it here I put the hot

687
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,980
jump price list for for iOS for mobile

688
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,550
and as the price is a little bit too low

689
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,520
yeah low well now I think but it was a

690
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,630
price like six months ago

691
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,190
so let's speak a little bit about the

692
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,810
manual analysis and what you can do

693
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,450
first thing some application are only by

694
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,849
the upper G arm so it's the application

695
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,829
it's all the stuff

696
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,829
upper sometime use GM so you must Jerry

697
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:43,339
glyph device and use a script named EF

698
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:44,000
inject

699
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,339
it's on github you can download it and

700
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:48,140
he will execute the encrypted

701
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,360
application

702
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,850
and takes an encrypted version from the

703
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,190
memory and package it for you and you

704
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,840
will have the unencrypted version of the

705
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,470
application so it's really simple the

706
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,380
most common technique I saw in my case

707
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,050
it is free one library injection web

708
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,910
keep interaction and crystal key ball

709
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,820
how works labor injection so you have a

710
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,310
huge community of people that make tweak

711
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,130
on application which is a tweak that

712
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,370
take legitimate application patch the

713
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,040
legitimate application with new feature

714
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,360
for example on whatsapp you can only

715
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,690
have one account per foot so some guys

716
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,100
take whatsapp and it did add support of

717
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,130
media account so you have to tap and you

718
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,790
have account one account to as it not

719
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:40,720
supported by by whatsapp a guy did did

720
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,960
it you can download it it's developer

721
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,970
certificate extra you can steal it on

722
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,160
your phone and it's not malicious really

723
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,960
I check the application it really do

724
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,240
what the developers say it's you have

725
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,370
the support of two words app but some

726
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,020
other people use exactly the same tricks

727
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,810
of tweeting a tweaking application to

728
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,750
had malicious code basically it works

729
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,460
you have the application you have a

730
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,950
library and when you compile the

731
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,690
application you say ok you will load the

732
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,310
library when you execute the real

733
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,290
application for the attacker is really

734
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,810
useful because it doesn't have to write

735
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,880
the original application it takes a real

736
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,550
one and simply inject a library inside

737
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,950
of the real one so for for users the

738
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,630
users it's really hard to detect if it's

739
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,940
a real one or not because in fact it's a

740
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,540
real one patched you have open source

741
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,120
project that explained you how to do

742
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,110
this

743
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,760
sistahs it's a pretty complicated and

744
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,060
the point is when you are inside of the

745
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,760
application if the user I use this

746
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,790
application which is a fake one as

747
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,010
occurred the malicious code is executed

748
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,810
inside of the application he has access

749
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,530
to the data of the application so if

750
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,620
whatsapp if I drop a log chat on the

751
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,320
phone so malicious code they will have

752
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,030
access to the repository

753
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,270
where

754
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,980
information are logged Susan Manuel can

755
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,470
simply get the file and exfiltrate the

756
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,850
file - to the attackers

757
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:12,368
it's natively support and it's like that

758
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,810
another thing we with so it was a fake

759
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,280
Instagram application and the

760
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,530
application was very light it was simply

761
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,680
a browser going on instagram.com nothing

762
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,980
else the application download the HTML

763
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,240
code of Instagram but patch it add some

764
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,970
JavaScript inside and there is an

765
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,290
example where they use a trick secretin

766
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,900
event and when the users click on the

767
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,369
login is a iOS application take what the

768
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:49,040
users put inside of the field and send

769
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,600
the information to the attackers so

770
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,860
basically the purpose is to state

771
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,840
cultures

772
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:59,770
so we discover this application on Star

773
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,350
used in Iran because yeah it's another

774
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:09,590
joke on some country due to US sanctions

775
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,750
it cannot have access to the legitimate

776
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,090
store in u.s. but as they can as they

777
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,890
must use a phone they create a local

778
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,470
store and the user local star with fake

779
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,340
copy of real application so it's where

780
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,780
we found this this malicious Instagram

781
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,820
application

782
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,590
so yeah it's basically what what I

783
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:37,790
explained also think we discovered it's

784
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,859
another it's less aggressive than the

785
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:42,369
previous one we don't if I click folder

786
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,500
so i explained to you check-rein the

787
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,260
exploit and this is a jet bike and this

788
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,600
jet bike is not released yet the guy is

789
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,150
on Twitter post a lot of picture about

790
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,270
how the work is going on and they can

791
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,670
get back this version this version so

792
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,440
they already make a lot of communication

793
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,950
but the source code is not available and

794
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,580
they register check Francom with a one

795
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,960
because it's the name of the project and

796
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,270
there's a guy registered chicane but

797
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,680
come with I not with the one and

798
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,070
said yes I provide the JJ check check

799
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,260
for energy brackets you simply need to

800
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,030
download this profile and once you

801
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,130
download this profile you will have a

802
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,810
jet back on your device you don't even

803
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,590
need to connect it in USB it it's magic

804
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,510
in fact if you look at the profile the

805
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,080
description is a simply fake and it

806
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,350
contains a web clip a web clip is for

807
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,650
Apple simply a bookmark a bookmark on

808
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,850
your on your desktop so here is what it

809
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:51,360
is for for real so when you install the

810
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,870
the perfect this icon is on your phone

811
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:02,800
check-rein and if you click on it you

812
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,190
will see the attackers was very creative

813
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,070
in fact it's simply a bookmark to a to a

814
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:14,110
website and you will see the website if

815
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:18,820
the video want yeah so you can see it's

816
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,400
in full screen so the advantage of web

817
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,620
clip is you don't see the bosses so

818
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,210
you've really looks like a real

819
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,670
application and yeah I check rain click

820
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,470
on the pattern it check your device

821
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,580
which is wrong

822
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,370
check version it's simply JavaScript it

823
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:40,600
does nothing it's just visual and after

824
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,380
he load your preference whatever it

825
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,720
means expect in your channel get random

826
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,580
memory doesn't match my memory and yeah

827
00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:00,310
it's a bike congratulation yeah the next

828
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,820
step you will have a fake terminal to

829
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,970
look serious you know and you need to

830
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,540
confirm how sure you do your backup so

831
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,420
yeah you have a kind of fake shell Cydia

832
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,030
is a store used by G bike or on

833
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:19,150
jailbroken device and yeah it's

834
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,130
successful load daemon and stuff like

835
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,680
that and finally if you want to full jet

836
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,010
bike please play this game and when you

837
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,569
click on the game you want to in

838
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:30,999
you're him and you yes you need to play

839
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:34,299
seven days before having your device jet

840
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:37,869
bike which is wrong of course so yeah

841
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:40,449
and finally move you to the real star

842
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:41,439
and you need to instance this

843
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,599
application extracts and nothing happens

844
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:50,079
obviously and finally another really

845
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,419
funny stuff is I'm a little bit late

846
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:56,469
sorry is we you can develop christum

847
00:42:56,469 --> 00:43:00,429
keyboard so it's a crazy idea but Apple

848
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:02,739
support custom keyboard so you are

849
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:04,839
developer and you say yeah I don't like

850
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,150
the Apple keyboard I want to use magics

851
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,489
my layer not supported by Apple and you

852
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:13,689
can create your own keyboard so as you

853
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:15,519
can imagine if you have your own

854
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:17,169
keyboard you can do what you want with a

855
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:20,319
keyboard so here you have a keyboard on

856
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:26,410
my phone and you can see each key I push

857
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,660
you have the value on the left so it's

858
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,400
said to the server so it's a key logger

859
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,979
basically it's a crystal keyboard used

860
00:43:32,979 --> 00:43:38,019
as a key logger and it's supported Apple

861
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:39,849
did something really smart with system

862
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:41,919
keyboard you cannot steal password with

863
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,989
that because even if you deploy your

864
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,479
custom keyboard on your device if you

865
00:43:46,479 --> 00:43:49,059
try to write something on the password

866
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,459
field it automatically switch to the

867
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:54,459
real upper keyboard and once you left

868
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:57,369
the password field for normal text field

869
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,229
it switched back to the crystal keyboard

870
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:00,969
so you can still description you can

871
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:02,890
start chat you can still user name but

872
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,650
you can disturb as well so it's it's

873
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:09,609
pretty clever from my point of view so

874
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:14,349
yeah I tried to show you all the stuff I

875
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:17,049
so in real life so it's not on my lab

876
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:19,299
just to show you what could be done all

877
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:23,769
this case up for real Apple is doing a

878
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:25,479
great job miss security point of view

879
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:27,729
for and user point of view and it's very

880
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:30,939
it's a lot of effort to become route and

881
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:32,409
make some very bad cell phone on the

882
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:36,510
device but when you are defender and you

883
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,119
you have to whatsapp on your phone sir

884
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,800
which is not normal it's normally

885
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,540
impossible to have two words up on your

886
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,040
phone and you want to do some

887
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,839
investigation you have a huge limitation

888
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,950
due to this security put put by Apple on

889
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,240
the on device and you need to be

890
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,510
creative you need to perform a few

891
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,920
months after the reserved jail but you

892
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,319
can have the phone extra extra so it's

893
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,050
it's a lot of effort and obviously marva

894
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,890
exists on this kind of devices and we

895
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,900
have the proof we identify a couple of

896
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,119
different Marwa it's documenting you can

897
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,619
go on our blog post and you will see

898
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:13,020
exactly where we found it's a group

899
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,410
behind etc extra extra so but it was not

900
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,720
the purpose of the door to speak about

901
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,869
so copán and simply to show you it's

902
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:25,380
very exist and the state of art from my

903
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,920
point of view concerning iOS forensic

904
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,000
analysis and marwah and I'm three

905
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,540
minutes late who will be ok we sure we

906
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,740
can make it up Paul thank you very much

907
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,160
to the top

908
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,130
okay do we were a minute or two late but

909
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,630
we can take a question or two if anyone

910
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,349
has any we've got one at least you're

911
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:54,580
lucky you got a question

912
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,339
mostly because you drew a stop see yeah

913
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:07,080
you should try thank thank you for that

914
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,140
I have two questions actually after

915
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,589
after exploiting the hood wrong with

916
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:18,609
checkmate is it is it possible to run

917
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,690
the dual boot or is it can be dumped the

918
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,220
custom firmware and the second question

919
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,790
is like after after jailbreaking into

920
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,150
the I voice can you see the user data I

921
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,940
mean like is it encrypted yeah it's a

922
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,400
good question because

923
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,650
Apple had did something else very clever

924
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:45,190
the users data are not in clear so you

925
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,740
need to bid to get access to the data to

926
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,720
decrypt that times you fight opposite

927
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,150
SMS are not studying explained on your

928
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,220
phone it's encrypted and you need the

929
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,830
pin to decrypt this information so even

930
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,410
if you have checkmate and check-rein and

931
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:03,099
you are able to do custom stuff modifies

932
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:04,810
the memory jailbreak the device or

933
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:07,660
whatever you cannot have access to the

934
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,890
data of the users it's it's not possible

935
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,960
you need to have the pin to decrypt the

936
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,480
data so even if someone takes your phone

937
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,089
when you are the hotel put USB cable and

938
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:22,599
use some magics stuff if he doesn't have

939
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:25,060
your pin he will only have encrypted

940
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,380
data if he has your pin you can steal

941
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,570
your data so the pin up in your

942
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,020
fingerprint or your face or whatever

943
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,930
encrypt your data so no even with this

944
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,210
they cannot access to your data you need

945
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,220
to reboot the phone and do a few extra

946
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,609
so everything is encrypted from that

947
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:48,240
point of view

948
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:55,670
oh one more won't take no more okay just

949
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:56,300
be quick

950
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,280
is there any good repositories or

951
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,109
sources if you're wanting to get into

952
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:02,359
the area or or kind of analyze things

953
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:04,640
yourself like obviously windows other

954
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,350
platforms there's a lot of readily

955
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,690
available malware that you can download

956
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,550
and look at yeah in in our case I don't

957
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,680
know if the sample we analyzed on the on

958
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,700
virustotal

959
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,580
to practice I'm not sure maybe you need

960
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,070
to do two to check or even if you don't

961
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,330
work on Marriott you can work on

962
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,040
legitimate application to understand how

963
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,690
it works and to create your lab you

964
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,420
don't necessarily need the malware even

965
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,359
you develop your own in the world and

966
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,220
you will play with signature adopt

967
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,900
certificate and stuff like that and you

968
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,300
will clearly understand how it works so

969
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,430
you can if you don't find any public

970
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:43,160
malware you can do your own lol and

971
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,859
practice or you take establish

972
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:49,100
application it works also don't take the

973
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,960
star box application but have fault let

974
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,050
me say that guys that's US done if you

975
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,980
want Sepoy you'll be a party yeah if you

976
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,260
have questions feel free to yeah also

977
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,280
sears poor thanks very much
