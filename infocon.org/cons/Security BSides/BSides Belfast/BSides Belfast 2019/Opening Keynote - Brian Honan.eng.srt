1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,580
good morning buddy and let's just to say

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,370
thanks very much to Warren and the

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,990
b-sides birth class crew for having me

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,480
here today to give your opening keynote

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,510
it is a honor to be given Makino because

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,310
the the pressure is on you to sort of

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,100
set the tone for the day so I will

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,630
apologize straight away to Warren and

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,890
the rest of crew for the holiday it's

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,430
going to end up but so I want to talk to

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,700
you about given a keynote is is it's

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,440
kind of strange when you give talks at

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,269
conferences and especially at a tech

14
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,679
conference that's very focused like

15
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,269
b-sides are you can talk about

16
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:41,149
technology or hacking or some fantastic

17
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:43,010
red teaming or whatever as you did but

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,440
giving a keynote it's kind of setting

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,899
the tone for stuff so as you can see I'm

20
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,350
still very young ish who have been in

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,440
cyber security since cyber was a dirty

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,960
word I started my career back in the

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,399
1980s and I've titled this back to the

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,319
future because I want to talk about some

25
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,360
of the stuff that we look at and when I

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,350
was trying to figure out what we're

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,180
going to talk about today well Halloween

28
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,799
was off the team I could just talk about

29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,750
scary zero days and all that sort of

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,750
stuff and I says no the crophopper

31
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,850
exists but I think you know especially

32
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,579
today today was meant to be the day but

33
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,350
obviously that's something I'm sure

34
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,740
we're all sick of hearing about praxis

35
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,500
cyber security month so tomorrow if we

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,659
can all go back together nothing aware

37
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,390
of security any more brilliant but there

38
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,520
are key things but actually what really

39
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,899
struck me when I started looking at this

40
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:40,030
sort of stuff is happy fiftieth birthday

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,380
to the Internet October 50 years ago on

42
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,859
two days ago 29th of October 1969 the

43
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,979
first message was sent over DARPA net

44
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,780
that's what the internet looked like 50

45
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,799
years ago so what for and four points on

46
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,780
it this is probably a more realistic

47
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,950
picture of what it looks like today

48
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,780
we're all connected in many many

49
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,289
different ways with that connectivity

50
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,270
and that dependency we now have on the

51
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,128
internet there are much more restore

52
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:11,959
that we have to look at and if you look

53
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,080
at the World Economic Forum there

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,420
Burress report which the issue each year

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,690
after their meetings in in Davos in

56
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,400
Switzerland you would see the

57
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,540
cybersecurity is the number tree the top

58
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,780
likelihood in risk in in terms of

59
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,390
likelihood against the global economy so

60
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,830
right there behind extreme weather

61
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,050
events natural disasters and cyber

62
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,520
attacks are the tree top tree risks to

63
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,010
the world economy at the moment and the

64
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,930
impact and on the right there is a

65
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,900
number six is cyberattacks if a global

66
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,160
cyber attack is to hit the world economy

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,510
the impact would be the six most severe

68
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,060
that could happen to our economy so that

69
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,740
karna sends a message to us all that

70
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,300
these computers we play around with and

71
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,030
hack but they actually do play a

72
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,810
significant role in our daily lives

73
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,030
how we do things change from business to

74
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,730
everything else to communications to

75
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,250
warfare it's all changing and how we do

76
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,810
it we're all very aware our own

77
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,290
economies and our democracies have been

78
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,940
under attack from cyber security and

79
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,860
statistic the Cambridge analytical

80
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,670
scandal with regards to Facebook and how

81
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,250
people's votes were influenced Jim Brett

82
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,380
said and also during the u.s. elections

83
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,209
and now the UK elections coming up in

84
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,190
December you can be guaranteed there's

85
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,420
going to be more influence in there as

86
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,140
well so you know this is some serious

87
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,860
stuff but when we talk about cyber

88
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,180
attacks and I know there's going to be

89
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,920
lots of talk today very interesting

90
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,260
talks very technical talks about very

91
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,930
complicated attacks but if you actually

92
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,480
look in the real world at all the

93
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,489
different attacks that we've had and a

94
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,930
great source to look at that is the

95
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,130
Verizon data breach investigations

96
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,310
report and so people who familiar with

97
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,489
the Verizon DB or those of you who

98
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,470
aren't I would strongly encourage you to

99
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,019
go to Verizon's website and download

100
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,410
their report they take data from many

101
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,880
different sources from their own

102
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,350
customers about cyber attacks they've

103
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,390
had but also from the likes of Europe

104
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,199
all

105
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,569
the FBI our US Secret Service the

106
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,639
Australian Federal Police Symantec

107
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,479
McAfee all the big security companies

108
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,699
search around the world they take that

109
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,160
data the analyzers and the produced this

110
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,410
report and nice easy ways that you can

111
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,590
digest it to figure out what's got goes

112
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,270
on so you can see the majority of

113
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,729
attacks happened from from outsiders

114
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,449
majority attacks are financially

115
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:54,250
motivated which means criminals are now

116
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,650
getting more more involved in in

117
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,410
cybercrime it's no longer hackers

118
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,940
playing around the internet

119
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,009
taking down websites defacing website we

120
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,169
all know that but this is evidence to

121
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:10,270
show that things are changing and if you

122
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,099
look at all that data and you try and

123
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,419
extrapolate that and look into the

124
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,009
future we go well what are the future

125
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:17,500
attacks going to be like well it's going

126
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,150
to happen in the future and I just have

127
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,169
to say it's going to be more of the same

128
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,990
as I said I started off in as worked in

129
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,979
IT security in the 1980s and computer

130
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,479
viruses were the biggest risk we had

131
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,729
then computer viruses still the biggest

132
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,560
risks we have but just just called

133
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,870
ransomware now because it sounds

134
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,259
different

135
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,330
what's more the same and if you take

136
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,669
take Europe off the internet so they're

137
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:44,770
into organized crime threat assessment

138
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,270
again another very good report for you

139
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,520
to download and read and see what trends

140
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,310
are happening in cyber security here's

141
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,159
one of the key things the major threats

142
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,930
we face today such as ransomware our

143
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,419
business email compromised have been

144
00:05:58,419 --> 00:05:59,199
around for years

145
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,150
my dad is 83 he does not understand what

146
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,030
I do he keeps asking me Brian what does

147
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,219
your job do so i actually sat down I

148
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,750
think about a month ago instead looked

149
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,969
at we try make people's computers more

150
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:15,280
secure I said people get these letters

151
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,530
asking them to you know from a Nigerian

152
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,650
prince to sent it can they take twenty

153
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,000
million dollars into your bank account

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,759
and then you keep 10% and ship it on or

155
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,340
they send an email saying the you know

156
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,659
you need to pay this invoice really

157
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,900
really quickly and it turns out that

158
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,550
they've it's it's a criminal trying to

159
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,680
fill the concrete into pain that the

160
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,540
invoice home attack goes really

161
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,910
and I said yeah I actually thought I had

162
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,640
him and he goes when I walked in the

163
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,710
1970s we got those things on the telex

164
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,830
and the fax machines so criminals aren't

165
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,830
going to use the same techniques they

166
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,070
have used all along because they work

167
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,420
they're just going to transfer them into

168
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,930
the cyber world I'm the biggest threats

169
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,910
we face and the bits of risk risk to all

170
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,000
of our businesses are the common run the

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,420
day run the mill cybersecurity attacks

172
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,710
current premise will continue refining

173
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,010
attacks that have been known to work and

174
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,030
the last one that even read the

175
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,010
unsophisticated frauds that leverage

176
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,140
social engineering for great monetary

177
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,590
gain

178
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,050
so criminals are not going to be using a

179
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,410
just arrow days they're not going to be

180
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,670
using the latest hacks they're going to

181
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,660
use email on the phone to break into a

182
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,120
lot of companies and if you look at many

183
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,910
using the data from Verizon and octa and

184
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,100
even from the serta are one in our and

185
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,710
we get about 30,000 instance per year

186
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,830
the majority of the instance all come

187
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,920
down to this it's poor passwords it's

188
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,260
missing patches vulnerabilities old

189
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,420
outdated web platforms ColdFusion

190
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,330
WordPress not being updated etc

191
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,070
out-of-date antivirus software and lack

192
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,350
of monitoring the Verizon data breach

193
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,020
report will say that on average most

194
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,360
companies will not detect a beam breach

195
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,250
until months after the beaches happened

196
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,350
so that's like having a burglar alarm on

197
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,850
your house I mean now here in a corn off

198
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,800
onto six weeks after the burglar has

199
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,990
been in and triggered alarm off you know

200
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,730
so the that Lister root causes well

201
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,130
there is a very famous saying insanity

202
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,480
is doing the same thing over and over

203
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,710
again and expecting different results

204
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,460
and we are developing new technologies

205
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,680
we we have I you know the Internet of

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,330
Things

207
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,770
industrial control systems we're all

208
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,640
trying to bring everything online what

209
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,929
we're repeating the same mistakes we

210
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,390
made over and over again and we don't

211
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,190
learn this is Martin Rose where he's a

212
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,929
senior director of research at Trend

213
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,320
Micro and I remember a few years ago in

214
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,950
Brownsville and a conference were a

215
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,230
chatting away about this Martin said

216
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,520
this two minutes that still could be

217
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,650
since we don't learn

218
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,550
in cybersecurity when a breach happens

219
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,130
this is the reaction most of us have I

220
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,730
can't believe it they got hot my god

221
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,790
they're so bad the security sucks how

222
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,390
could the Agha hacked now hands up here

223
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,460
anybody who has to patch 10,000

224
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,600
computers every month hands up here

225
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,160
who's the patch one computer every month

226
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,010
whose job is easier yeah so it's all

227
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,200
very well and good for to say yes you

228
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,940
should be patching stuff when you have

229
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,260
to patch 10,000 computers with

230
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,540
dependencies it takes a lot of time I'm

231
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,150
not trying to give people a get off the

232
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,920
hook quite likely but we do have to get

233
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,480
away from this victim-blaming

234
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,170
people who are hacked are victims I walk

235
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,270
out of here and I get mugged out in the

236
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,060
streets I should not be blamed for being

237
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,420
mugged the criminal who moves me she'll

238
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,760
be the one who's been blamed companies

239
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,950
that get hacked should not be blamed for

240
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,450
being hacked there are victims of a

241
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,839
crime and the criminals who commit the

242
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,959
crime should be now yes we can say Brian

243
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,339
you walked out the street what you are

244
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,020
hanging out your back pocket your iPhone

245
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,000
in your hand and you weren't paying any

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,250
attention no wonder you got mauled but

247
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,890
still I'm a victim company of our victim

248
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,600
we should stop the victim blaming and

249
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,029
get away from us because what happens is

250
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,160
this is how we learn in cybersecurity we

251
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,709
become too afraid this is how we teach

252
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,450
people to develop and make things secure

253
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,240
is by books it's by courses he didn't

254
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,830
learn to ride your bicycle reading a

255
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,959
book you learn to ride your bicycle by

256
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,029
fallen officer I'm not doing that silly

257
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,250
thing again that's how we need to learn

258
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,290
and we need to get those lessons back in

259
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,209
again because we are too dependent

260
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:36,500
everything really

261
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,220
we rely on needs to be made more secure

262
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,140
this is our future we are going to be be

263
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,690
looking at all these things we keep

264
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,430
making the same mistakes we're gonna

265
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,100
have a very insecure future ahead our

266
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,900
economy is going to be insecure our

267
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,670
society is going to be insecure our

268
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,850
democracy is going to be insecure so we

269
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,700
need to take responsibility and learn

270
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,910
and improve things ourselves so that got

271
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,950
me think well for how can we and where

272
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,790
can we learn from

273
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,540
so entry enough October I'm so glad you

274
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,790
guys had besides Belfast October because

275
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,260
this is photography so much worse than

276
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,230
it wasn't well October 100 years ago KLM

277
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,540
celebrating 100 years so well don't KLM

278
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,850
that let me think about the airline

279
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,870
industry like 100 years ago if you look

280
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,200
at the erickson fatalities over the past

281
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,380
100 years you can see the 1920s not so

282
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,060
many air fatalities what do you know why

283
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,320
that's because there weren't so many

284
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,930
airplanes and there's a nice spike there

285
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,090
in 1940s I don't know what happens

286
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,800
around there and to cause lots of people

287
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,650
to die in airplanes but on a more

288
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,960
serious note if you take this past 50

289
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,570
years from the 1970s so fatal aviation

290
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,460
actions per million consumer flights so

291
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,090
so six per million so that the one

292
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,740
they're not incentive that there were

293
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,790
six people per million flights died so

294
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,860
there that's how many the rate that the

295
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,530
rate that the fatal aviation right down

296
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,070
to last year 2020 2017 you can see hello

297
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,640
down there

298
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,470
now last year okay it's fight again

299
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,220
because Boeing and the 737 max but

300
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,620
overall it's a very downward curve slope

301
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,380
we need to get that into cyber security

302
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,740
we're probably upward the 1970s are

303
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,750
right now we need to start learning and

304
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,940
improving how we do that because when

305
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,270
you look at that everything that we have

306
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,970
is insecure the internet was never

307
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,360
designed to be secure it was never

308
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,520
desert the software we have is not

309
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,740
secure out of the box I don't care

310
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,970
what's our free time but Windows

311
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,020
Macintosh Linux they're all insecure the

312
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,080
hardware we rely on is insecure look at

313
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,700
all the phony base that we found in

314
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,340
Intel chips now there so you can harden

315
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,770
your operating systems much you want put

316
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,900
the chips they rely on are just as

317
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,150
insecure as well so everything in

318
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,330
airplanes have to be SPECT you can't go

319
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,540
out on to it to some to eBay and buy a

320
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,430
jet engine for your plane I'm and pull

321
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,650
it on your airplane you have to buy from

322
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,120
specific manufacturers to very specific

323
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,660
tyria to allow that to be set up in your

324
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,020
airplane oops

325
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,190
everything has to be maintained properly

326
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,210
as well that's one thing that we kind of

327
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,460
fall flat on a lot of plates and IT is

328
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,800
we don't do good UPS management or

329
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,420
change control or looking out for our

330
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,720
systems airliners have to be maintained

331
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,550
on a regular basis to exact

332
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,370
specifications as well and testing

333
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,980
testing testing testing your application

334
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,650
is not running a pen test when it once

335
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,570
it's gone live are as are launching a

336
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,610
bug bounty program once it's gone live

337
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,520
you need to have security built in right

338
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,470
from the very very beginning to ensure

339
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,940
security all along nope along the way

340
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,060
that by the way is they're given the the

341
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,450
airplane water ingestion testing see how

342
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,870
it will become withstand water going to

343
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,930
the engines etc things a cool picture

344
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,740
but there's also international

345
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,410
agreements you hijack an airplane

346
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,690
it's an international crime you're going

347
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,570
to be done first we don't have the same

348
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,100
level of international agreements for

349
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,510
law enforcement or international

350
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,730
cooperation against cybercrime if I

351
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,190
commit a crime here in Belfast against

352
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,959
the website in Russia and use that

353
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,640
Russian website to hack a website in the

354
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,550
u.s. that's three jurisdictions I have

355
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,830
to get involved and many of them aren't

356
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,480
you know that's going to take a long

357
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,220
time we need better international

358
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,920
agreements to sort that out we need

359
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,320
better training you can't just jump into

360
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,750
an airplane on flyers you have to go to

361
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,240
a specific training that's very strict

362
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,480
I'm very rigorous and you have to get at

363
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,730
the end and once you do qualify you

364
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,720
still have to follow

365
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,230
Reba's procedures every flight has to go

366
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,750
through a pre-check flight the same on

367
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,310
all the time to make sure it will work

368
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,209
we don't do that inside in NIT we launch

369
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:10,220
systems on the internet and we keep

370
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,010
suiza it'll work don't worry we fixed

371
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,890
that problem in the next release yeah

372
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,330
you can't fix your problem the next

373
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,440
release when you're at this house with

374
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,860
feet in the air and the passenger that

375
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,459
are taught how to survive is one doom

376
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,410
research for this I actually discovered

377
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,959
the other hours ask myself if I'm flying

378
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:30,890
from

379
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,500
to Germany why did they have a life vest

380
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,360
underneath the chair cuz I'm gonna crash

381
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,620
land on ground and I was told life vests

382
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,390
aren't there to save your life actually

383
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,890
they're totally find the bodies easier

384
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,570
so that's a cheerful Nell free on

385
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,570
Halloween and we have air traffic

386
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,130
controlled because it's national

387
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,910
cooperation people work together to make

388
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,520
to make flights safe or etc and then

389
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,680
there's regular checks regular updates

390
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,070
make sure the thing works make sure it's

391
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,050
every time a plane lands it is checked

392
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,640
to make sure that it's going to be safe

393
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,250
and then security we make sure anything

394
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,830
we put on it is ready secure I know we

395
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,240
all hate these scanners but they do say

396
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,400
for server server purpose the amount of

397
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,500
hijacks etc have fallen dramatically

398
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,980
from what from the 1970s and 1980s and

399
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,440
then when things do go wrong you have

400
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,990
error investigation accidents come in

401
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,820
and investigators and they will

402
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,530
investigate the accident and they will

403
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,310
publish their findings warts and all we

404
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,610
don't do that in cybersecurity a company

405
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,220
gets hacked we don't know the one that

406
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,350
always strikes me as and I remember the

407
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,920
Equifax hack so if you read the report

408
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,230
you will see that they said yes we had

409
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,790
our vulnerability scanner scan the

410
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,770
system but never detected that the

411
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,190
system that the patch was missing I

412
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,680
would love to know either a what that

413
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,480
Funabashi management software was

414
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,580
because Mir one of my customers using

415
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,350
that or B was it a an error on behalf of

416
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,079
somebody who's using that tool but we

417
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,819
don't have that data so therefore we're

418
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,410
not learning therefore some BS is going

419
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,000
to have the same problem down the road

420
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,619
and they're going to become a victim as

421
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,619
well so we need to move away from being

422
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,420
the old way we need to move to something

423
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,510
to do something new first of all I think

424
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,599
we need to stop the foot and forever no

425
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,390
the foot is the fear uncertainty and

426
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,690
doubt we love it we love being the scary

427
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,280
man in the corner of the scary press in

428
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,020
the corner gone oh booga-booga-booga

429
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,640
cybersecurity if you don't put your

430
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,270
systems are going to be hacked I say to

431
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,580
my team every time you discover a

432
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,230
vulnerability or a security issue with a

433
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,620
client ask your question

434
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,860
the question cell wash so they've got

435
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,440
her played on the website so what what

436
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,620
does it really mean and keep asking that

437
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,059
question to figure out what the impact

438
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,220
is because he can't go run into

439
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,110
everybody go on the sky is falling the

440
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,940
sky is falling we need to get away from

441
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,820
it we need politicians I mean we need

442
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,220
vendors to stop putting lies on the side

443
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,790
of buses yeah we need to stop focusing

444
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,809
on the apts in the zero days we need to

445
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,580
make sure that we focus on the the stuff

446
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,020
that really is going to cause somebody

447
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,120
get hacked it's not an apt Caesarea run

448
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,570
it's going to be put somebody's password

449
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,679
so spend time and they've been

450
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:29,250
multi-factor authentication instead of

451
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,270
trying to worry about the ladle a

452
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,740
zero-day but with all that said one

453
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,330
thing I don't want to kill here is the

454
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,280
passion that we all have for the jobs

455
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,520
that we do at this great energy in this

456
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,990
room and even last night's speaking to

457
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,840
be from the tireless team and so even

458
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,910
when they're on their downtime we're all

459
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,620
talking about cybersecurity how to make

460
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,929
it better so we have a passion that that

461
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:54,580
passion has brought you here today to

462
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,920
give up a day of your own time or take

463
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,960
time off work or whatever to be here

464
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,910
that is passion that we need and we need

465
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,650
to nurture and keep it going

466
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,360
but we need to direct that passion much

467
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,150
better while the Internet is 50 years

468
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,760
old cybersecurity we're probably still

469
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,290
in our late teens and we're still that

470
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,570
stroppy teenager that we and we need to

471
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,230
grow out of being disrupting teenager

472
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,730
because one thing we need to look at as

473
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,910
well is what what is a cyber security

474
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,100
professional if I want to get a plumber

475
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,000
I have to get somebody who's licensed

476
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,320
about to get electrician I have to get

477
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,210
somebody who's licensed if I if I get my

478
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,140
dad to water my house I break it well in

479
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,030
a lease in Republic of Ireland I in a

480
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,730
breaking the law I can't sell my house

481
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,830
if it's not certified I nod to get a

482
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,450
certified I need a qualified plumber an

483
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,090
engineer

484
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,430
RIT anybody can just

485
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,740
go up and say yeah I'm a pro I'm an

486
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,930
expert you know so we need to

487
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,750
professionalize the industry so those of

488
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,280
you who don't know this is Javed Malik

489
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,010
and he has a very famous video about sis

490
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,550
and such as fashion assist care now I'm

491
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,810
not advocating everybody

492
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,420
John is c-squared why I'm saying though

493
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,340
is we need to professionalize our

494
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,560
industry we need to have accountability

495
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,680
that have you or me or anybody else

496
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,320
screws up we are held accountable first

497
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,300
because the amount of times we've come

498
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,430
across shoddy work where people have

499
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,590
gone in and sold a pen test to a

500
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,540
customer but it's actually been an SS

501
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,420
can but they've got to give an advice to

502
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,280
a customer on something and they don't

503
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,050
have they credentials to back it up just

504
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,770
because I'm an expert trust me we can't

505
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,430
we have to go beyond that now and we're

506
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,230
going to have to embrace compliance I

507
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,050
know we hate the words compliance and

508
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,640
regulations and stuff but it's happening

509
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,030
we already have GDP or and that has seen

510
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,560
significant improvements in cyber

511
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,170
security we've seen in pH consulting

512
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,060
we've seen a huge drive and people

513
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,130
trying to improve the security because

514
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,850
at each PR before GDP are oh yeah we

515
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,170
take data protection seriously don't

516
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,390
worry about it we're secure now they're

517
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,880
going with GDP are can you make sure

518
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,710
we're secure can he give us assurance as

519
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,060
we are the network information security

520
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,590
director from the EU which came into

521
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,820
effect last year as well

522
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,440
focuses on critical network

523
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
infrastructure which includes banks

524
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,880
telcos etc that's improving security and

525
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,530
if you work in those industries you have

526
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,420
to work against that directive as well

527
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,730
the EU Cyber Security Act came into

528
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,190
effect this summer that is going to

529
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,540
start improving securities you can see

530
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,280
these regulations coming in I want the

531
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,530
key things which I'm instance see how

532
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,690
it's going to work is the use of secure

533
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,230
has a certification scheme in it today

534
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,460
if I move on to sell an IP based CCTV

535
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,340
camera to you I just have go to China I

536
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,680
get somebody to make the device I have

537
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,510
to make sure the electrical components

538
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,340
and the physical components of that

539
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,770
device meets certain safety standards

540
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,270
that when you plug it in it doesn't blow

541
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,460
up or go on for

542
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,260
the software put on it though there is

543
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,510
no standards on that that is changing

544
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,670
with this obscure yet you will have to

545
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,799
certify software to be secure to be able

546
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,020
to sell it that is going to be a big

547
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,120
game-changer in our industry cuz gonna

548
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,250
force vendors to take responsibility for

549
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,100
super security third thing is gonna be

550
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,299
big drivers insurance

551
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,860
I've already seen one insurance company

552
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,790
say we will reduce your your premium if

553
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,470
you're using any of these following

554
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,900
products so the insurance companies are

555
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,760
going to be getting data they spent

556
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,140
centuries analyzing risk they're gonna

557
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,580
bring that discipline to cybersecurity

558
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,960
we're going to see a huge change and

559
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,250
that's what we need to embrace that as

560
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:43,640
well

561
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,740
and the business people are demanding

562
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,190
better security now 15 years ago when I

563
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,720
sort of pH consulting I was talking to

564
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,419
IT people now we're talking to the

565
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,280
boards they're the ones who bring us in

566
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,179
they're the ones who care about

567
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,030
cybersecurity so we still need to have

568
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,679
that passion we still need to fight

569
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,540
today for a better tomorrow because with

570
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,669
this dependency and cybersecurity and it

571
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:06,169
depends in the internet there's a lot of

572
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:07,820
other people start and get interested in

573
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,919
this field not just us and they're not

574
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,679
geeks these are people who political

575
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,540
motivations business motivations and

576
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,980
they have certain things they want to

577
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,460
get done so we don't and shouldn't stand

578
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,740
alone we need to work together we need

579
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,380
to work outside our industry and outside

580
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,299
our community with other industries to

581
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,490
fix a lot of the problems as well we

582
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,070
need to make sure we embrace the

583
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,690
business side of things and talk to

584
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,280
business to see what they need to get

585
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,370
done we need to ensure we continue

586
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,350
hacking stuff defined for our the

587
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,440
weaknesses are so we can improve the

588
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,110
systems that we rely on we have a very

589
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,150
fight role under is making sure the

590
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,970
stuff people a lot people rely on be

591
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,890
they there are autonomous cars be that

592
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,360
they're there medical equipment in a

593
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,070
hospital be that the nuclear plant that

594
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,799
is give enough power that those systems

595
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,260
are secure we have a responsibility to

596
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,419
make sure that keeps happening the same

597
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:03,980
time we need to make sure that

598
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,169
technology is not abused so mass

599
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:07,630
surveillance we need to keep ourselves

600
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,540
focus on that and avoid that happening

601
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,640
likewise encryption backdoors we need to

602
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,600
educate people

603
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,549
why encryption backdoors

604
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:20,749
don't work and we can't have this one

605
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:22,609
side of the iron golem

606
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:24,109
but somebody think of the children we

607
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,339
need to have back to us and encryption

608
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,739
so we can catch the bad guys and on our

609
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:29,419
cyclone you can't break encryption don't

610
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:30,499
predict this we need to meet in the

611
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:30,799
middle

612
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,659
because we need to educate people on

613
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:35,389
that size of why you can't backdoor

614
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:36,200
encryption that's mathematically

615
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,599
impossible it's like saying well crime

616
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,580
happens at nighttime so therefore let's

617
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,859
stop the Sun going down and we need as I

618
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,419
said software vendors to take great

619
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,029
responsibility many people here have an

620
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:55,879
Apple Mac laptop a Windows laptop how

621
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:57,919
many of you own the operating system on

622
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,929
that lot on those devices no you don't

623
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:05,570
your are leasing your licensing the

624
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,690
operating system you don't own it and

625
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,429
that's a nice legal legal trick by the

626
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:13,190
vendors together of any liability they

627
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,469
have on selling your product because you

628
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:18,109
don't own it they don't have to fix the

629
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:21,709
problems in it so we need to force the

630
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:25,839
vendors to take better responsibility on

631
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,769
securing the systems and devices they

632
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,629
sell us these things take time we won't

633
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:34,249
be fixing these things tonight because

634
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:35,659
what else the after party is going to

635
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,329
happen but tomorrow night even but it's

636
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,249
going to take a while but we need to

637
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,779
work together and we need to embrace

638
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,729
each other and all the different

639
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:45,950
backgrounds people have so that we can

640
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,649
make the world a better and more secure

641
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:51,139
place for everybody else as well it is

642
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:54,919
our future is what we need and it's what

643
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,889
we need especially people my age we need

644
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,259
to make sure that the mess we've created

645
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,389
on the Internet because we didn't create

646
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:04,820
a secure internet we didn't do pretty

647
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,919
good with the climate either so listen

648
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,759
guys you know please we need to work

649
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,379
together better so that we can fix

650
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:14,989
everything as well so with that thank

651
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:17,440
you very much
