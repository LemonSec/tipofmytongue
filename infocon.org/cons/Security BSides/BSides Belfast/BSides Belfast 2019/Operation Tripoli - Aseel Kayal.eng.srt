1
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:07,309
hello hi thank you everyone for

2
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,040
attending thank you for having me thank

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,719
you for not falling asleep after lunch

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:14,719
so good to see you all just to briefly

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,910
introduce myself before I start talking

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,750
about the talk

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,930
my name is Seale I work at the threat

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,550
intelligence analysis group at

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,690
checkpoint

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,450
I've been there for three years and I

11
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,000
mainly well most of my work focuses on

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,940
Middle East stuff and this talk is no

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,899
different

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,329
actually this talk has a lot to do with

15
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,440
Libya and if you don't know where the

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,659
country of Libya is it's actually right

17
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:43,399
in the middle of this math I made it a

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,089
bit easy it's North Africa but Libya has

19
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,359
a very interesting history because back

20
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,710
in the day it was ruled by a king and in

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,829
1969 that King was abroad in Turkey and

22
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:59,479
Greece supposedly to receive some

23
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,789
medical treatment and there was a

24
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,909
revolution against him and that

25
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:06,439
revolution succeeded quite easily there

26
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,240
wasn't a lot of resistance to it and

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,909
then someone else rose to power someone

28
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,780
by the name of Qaddafi and Qaddafi

29
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,380
became a bit of an internet celebrity

30
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,990
for the recent years but before that he

31
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,630
was really the voice of change in Libya

32
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,729
he wanted to get rid of the corrupt

33
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,619
Kingdom he wanted to overthrow the

34
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,750
tyrant he turned the country into a

35
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,509
republic and because he was such an

36
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,030
advocate of change he only ruled for 40

37
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,549
years and by the end of that he didn't

38
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,390
even go willingly because in 2011 that

39
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,520
was actually the peak of the Arab Spring

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,009
so all over countries in the Middle East

41
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,380
there were protests asking the rulers

42
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,780
and the dictators to step down and to

43
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,880
improve the living circumstances within

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,039
those countries and the political chaos

45
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,649
started from Tunisia that's where the

46
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,140
protests first began and then spread

47
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,780
most notably to Egypt and Syria but the

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,030
it also reached Libya as well and

49
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,520
eventually Qaddafi was overthrown and

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,480
killed and the situation didn't improve

51
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,080
much

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,630
after that there was even a council that

53
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,060
was supposed to choose a replacement for

54
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,130
Qaddafi but they failed and they also

55
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,440
failed to prevent a second civil war

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,000
that happened in Libya in 2017 and since

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,640
that day or nowadays there are two major

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,340
people in power in Libya there is a

59
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,620
prime minister which leads the

60
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,600
government that the UN approves of and

61
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,570
there is a general marshal of the Libyan

62
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,580
National Army so he leads the rebel

63
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,220
powers against that prime minister and I

64
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,590
gave you that kind of Borak historic and

65
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,840
boring historic introduction in talib in

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,780
Libya because this dude the general

67
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,700
marshal or by his real name

68
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,670
afta appeared in an interesting context

69
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,250
a Facebook page that was using his name

70
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,440
and that page was created I think in

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,780
march and it was sharing posts like this

72
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,720
one and there are a lot of things that

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,790
we can tell from this post first off we

74
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,580
see that it had 5,000 reactions so a lot

75
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,440
of people were exposed to this post a

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,209
lot of people saw it and engaged with it

77
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,470
it was promising mobile applications

78
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,580
that word that could could have been

79
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,230
downloaded by the link that it offers

80
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,380
and they were supposedly providing the

81
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,130
users with the latest news from Libya

82
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,840
but in truth that they of course had

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,440
malware and they were malicious so I was

84
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,300
really curious just coming across this

85
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,490
post randomly going through stuff on

86
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,260
Facebook and I wanted to dig a bit

87
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,180
deeper into this and find out more about

88
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,270
this attack and this page all of the

89
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,950
posts that were shared by it were like

90
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,110
this one so they were sharing malicious

91
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,230
links to malicious files and so one of

92
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,910
the first questions I asked myself

93
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,430
coming across this post and trying to

94
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,040
investigate this further was are the

95
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,140
attacker is using other ways to spread

96
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,910
the smell where is this the only page

97
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,400
did the malicious activity start just

98
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,200
now or has this been going on for a

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,050
while and to answer that one of the

100
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,150
first ways that I've used was the

101
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,570
Facebook search part so I used that to

102
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,880
look up some of the links that were

103
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,560
downloaded the militia that we're

104
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,590
downloading the malicious files and that

105
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,040
in the posts by this page and doing that

106
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,419
I got back nothing and if you're if

107
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:33,310
you're familiar with the Facebook search

108
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,040
bar you have extensive stalking

109
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,050
experience you would know that not a lot

110
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,940
of the times it doesn't really give back

111
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,820
the most accurate results even when you

112
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,410
know a post is there you don't always

113
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,280
get it back

114
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,830
and that wasn't probably the most

115
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,560
effective way to check this but then I

116
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,780
realized that the posts included

117
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,400
something else besides the links

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,200
downloading the files they included text

119
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,660
and that text was an Arabic and I speak

120
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,790
Arabic and I can tell you that text was

121
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,700
so shitty that I even created a version

122
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,710
of the post with all of the grammatical

123
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,320
mistakes and wrong syntax and weird

124
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,330
phrasing highlighted you can see it's

125
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,130
kind of like very high percentage of the

126
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,380
post and I roughly translated that into

127
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,600
English with the mistakes you can kind

128
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,419
of feel or see how I felt reading this

129
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:26,220
and seeing this text in the post itself

130
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,260
but this can tell me two things first

131
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,780
off I can tell that whoever wrote this

132
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,320
text is an Arabic speaker because they

133
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,900
didn't really use translating engine or

134
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,729
Google Translate or whatever to generate

135
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:41,919
this because even though that might

136
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,750
sometimes mess up the message you're

137
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,580
trying to convey Google Translate will

138
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,070
give you back the word army with double

139
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,340
a or two with you etc and second of all

140
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,310
I can use that in my advantage so if I

141
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,460
can find those uniquely wrong mistakes

142
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,830
again being repeated elsewhere I can

143
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,780
probably say that it was the same person

144
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,050
who made that mistake and so I did that

145
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,090
and this time around when I looked up

146
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,310
some of the Arabic phrases that I saw in

147
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,400
the posts I got back results and I

148
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,479
actually got back many many many results

149
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,300
using this technique and you can see

150
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,280
that all of the results here also follow

151
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,139
the same patterns as just a small

152
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,300
caption and then a link leading to a

153
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,360
malicious file and soon enough I

154
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,240
realized that each link was shared by

155
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,500
more than one page

156
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,380
so we can really see the same text here

157
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,060
the same caption of the post and the

158
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,460
same link copied in multiple places on

159
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,940
the same day so I soon realized that

160
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,040
each such link had the potential of

161
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,890
exposing multiple related pages and then

162
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,050
those pages as I was going through them

163
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,320
revealed more links and the links

164
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,640
connected me to more pages and then

165
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,770
those pages connected back to the same

166
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,770
links so again I realize that could kind

167
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,260
of create a network here of URLs and

168
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,720
Facebook pages and I did that and this

169
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,240
is the full version of it all and it's

170
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,490
very ugly it's zoomed out you can't tell

171
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,050
anything about it but this is kind of

172
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,300
the full melty go graph of the graph of

173
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,980
the whole thing connecting all of the

174
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,890
pages and the URLs but we can really see

175
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,080
how interconnected this is and looking

176
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,540
at the connections we can tell that each

177
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,000
link was most of the links were shared

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,010
more more than once by the different

179
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,940
pages that were involved in this attack

180
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,890
and again just by mapping the whole

181
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,540
thing I was able to tell that the

182
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,960
activity goes back to at least 2014

183
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,570
that's the earliest instance I have seen

184
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,150
relating to this activity so it has been

185
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,100
going on for quite awhile when I came

186
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,970
across this I was also able to tell that

187
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,370
there are approximately 40 pages that

188
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,640
were involved in this operation and that

189
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,890
were being used to share the malicious

190
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,240
posts and I saw that this had a very

191
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,670
wide outreach because eventually some of

192
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,470
the pages that I came across and I was

193
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,080
able to connect this had tens of

194
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,450
thousands of followers and even two of

195
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,880
them had more than 100,000 followers so

196
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,510
you can imagine that each post that was

197
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,280
prompting victims to download a

198
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,960
malicious file had the potential of

199
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,570
reaching thousands or tens of thousands

200
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,490
of people each time through one

201
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,110
individual page and we can ask ourselves

202
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,590
well who is this after who are the

203
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,559
attackers trying to target using this

204
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,220
and you might have wild guess but we

205
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,110
were able to get more solid evidence

206
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,360
about the victims because actually all

207
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,260
of the posts or most of them were using

208
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,050
link shortening services so a lot of

209
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,510
Google short links and bitly and tiny

210
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,820
URL and what's great about those links

211
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,070
is that they story statistics so I can

212
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,200
see how many times they were clicked

213
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
where from and more information about

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,230
that so in the link I'm showing here for

215
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,649
example we can see that it was create

216
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,730
around the time it was great it was

217
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,600
clicked around 7,000 times and that was

218
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,930
also around the time it was shared and

219
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,490
that's a very high number as well but we

220
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,860
can also see that most the time the

221
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,870
victims or the people that click this

222
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,690
link were referred to it by Facebook so

223
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,730
we know that this is the major attack

224
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,990
vector for this campaign and out of the

225
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,300
seven thousand clicks five thousand

226
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,709
clicks came from surprise surprise Libya

227
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:42,529
and there were some victims supposedly

228
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,180
or some other clicks from different

229
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,740
countries but we can really see the

230
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,920
focus on this country by this attack and

231
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,709
again disclaimer a click does not mean

232
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,690
successful infection so these are just

233
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,070
the numbers of clicks we don't know that

234
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,230
they were victims eventually but we can

235
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,899
really see the focus on Libya even in

236
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,339
terms of links here and the same pages

237
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,320
that were involved in the malicious

238
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,370
activity shared other posts as well so

239
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,260
we also saw them sharing updates about

240
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,880
things that were going on in Libya and

241
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,310
news and that kind of followed the same

242
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,500
pattern so that the same post with the

243
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,269
same caption and picture was copied

244
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,110
across multiple pages and seeing this I

245
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,440
was very surprised I first off I thought

246
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,660
it was trying to push kind of hidden

247
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,290
propaganda or agenda and maybe trying to

248
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,880
influence some people but in reality

249
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,149
these were just news updates that were

250
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:43,820
trying to keep the followers of the

251
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,880
pages engaged and trying to keep them

252
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,970
following the pages themselves and just

253
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,890
to eventually click the malicious links

254
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,890
and increase the pages legitimacy

255
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,430
this wasn't really trying to politically

256
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,250
affect anyone's opinion I would say and

257
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,100
another question I was asking myself and

258
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,350
you might be is why why were the

259
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,910
attacker is using Facebook why this

260
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,779
social network so in Libya but also in

261
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,910
other countries where there is a lot of

262
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,519
political conflict I would say sometimes

263
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,149
your mainstream media or your main media

264
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,370
outlets the official news channels and

265
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,740
the official newspapers are not the best

266
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,350
source to get your news so a lot of the

267
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,570
times you would be thinking you're

268
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,329
seeing what's really going on when in

269
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,000
fact what you're following great the

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
channel is really giving you kind of a

271
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,600
biased idea of what is going on and

272
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,050
they're taking just one side and because

273
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,390
of that a lot of people in the Middle

274
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,100
East region but also in different places

275
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,790
have turned to other sources for news

276
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,589
and it involves obviously online

277
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,529
websites and online blogs but also

278
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,970
Facebook so Facebook has become kind of

279
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,880
a very reliable way for people to get

280
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,529
their news from and as soon as the

281
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,880
victims realize they're in sins that

282
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,980
people realize that threat actors were

283
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,320
very quick to follow so we also see that

284
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,870
in a lot of the misinformation campaigns

285
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,029
that have been exposed recently Facebook

286
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,970
has played a very major role and

287
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,709
actually such a campaign that was

288
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,149
exposed by Facebook's themselves by the

289
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,250
Facebook company that was affecting

290
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,829
countries such as Sudan and Libya it was

291
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:37,240
they discovered that the attackers

292
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,550
behind this attack invested nearly one

293
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,490
hundred thousand dollars in advertising

294
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,380
trying to reach the people or the

295
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,420
citizens of Libya and other countries

296
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,060
and affect them we're trying to kind of

297
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,070
humiliate one later and promote another

298
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,490
so again we really see how important

299
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,820
Facebook is in the

300
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,250
landscape in the Middle East also in

301
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,170
terms of misinformation campaigns but

302
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,600
also in terms of malware so we've seen

303
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,640
some of the more advanced players like

304
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,820
if you know of the dark caracal threat

305
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,910
group but also oh no okay sorry if you

306
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,470
know of the dark caracal threat group

307
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,440
and apt c-23 for example so we have also

308
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,810
seen them spreading their malicious

309
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,090
samples using Facebook so these are just

310
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,640
two examples of groups that they have

311
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,490
used or pages that they've used to reach

312
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,550
a wide audience of victims and even in

313
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,160
our case like although the posts or the

314
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,840
news headlines that the pages share it

315
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,350
weren't really trying to do something

316
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,420
like behind the stage or affect people

317
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,730
but we can still see that updating and

318
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,250
sharing those news about Libya and those

319
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,500
pages did keep the users engaged and it

320
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,110
was kind of a nice way to keep them

321
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,750
following the pages and since we've

322
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,210
mentioned malware here and malicious

323
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,700
files you might again also be wondering

324
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,890
what was the malware that was used in

325
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,120
this campaign so it wasn't very very

326
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,370
impressive I would say the attackers in

327
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,350
this case we're using kind of off the

328
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,990
shelf tools so known remote

329
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,270
administration tools for both mobile and

330
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,160
desktop that they were attacking the two

331
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,560
vectors in the case of mobile we saw

332
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,090
that a lot of the times they were using

333
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,520
spine out which again kind of provides

334
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,580
the attacker with with a nice panel that

335
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,800
can let them control basically anything

336
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,390
on the infected device and exfiltrate

337
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,820
all the information like contacts calls

338
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,180
and more sensitive stuff as well and in

339
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,730
terms of desktop so it was a lot of NJ

340
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,850
rat and other things that the attackers

341
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,500
didn't really develop themselves so they

342
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,050
again didn't waste a lot of time on

343
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,450
developing their own malware and in case

344
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,210
of desktop they did add some protective

345
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,570
layers before delivering the payload

346
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,870
eventually so we can see that when the

347
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,580
victims would download the filer when

348
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,560
they would click the link they at first

349
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,370
would be or would receive a VBS file or

350
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,550
at wsf file and you can even see that

351
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:07,920
the name

352
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,540
the file itself looks like a news

353
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,329
headline so just to keep the theme of

354
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,489
the posts going on and to convince the

355
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,139
victims that oh this is okay you should

356
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,519
click this should run this on your

357
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,819
machine and then opening up the VBS file

358
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,009
again we can see that it has this sort

359
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,829
of random blob it's first but it's not

360
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,959
really you can tell that this is just a

361
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,730
comment it's not really part of the code

362
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,100
and it's just used to hide the beginning

363
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,589
of the VBS code which is down at the

364
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,779
bottom so it's just meant to confuse any

365
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,910
victim who attempts to open this file

366
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,699
and the purpose of the VBS it just

367
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,220
basically take an array of decimal

368
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,720
values and turn it into the

369
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,319
corresponding ASCII characters and

370
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:51,359
eventually reverse that string and now

371
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:53,040
we can see that we get a more readable

372
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,100
code in this case and we still have an

373
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,369
encoded bit at the end and that is

374
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,220
basics t4 encoded and which is in this

375
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,350
case the payload the executable fails

376
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,799
the purpose of the VBS is to kind of

377
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,389
prepare for the payload to be executed

378
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:11,730
on the machine and the payload itself

379
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,639
was a dotnet executable again also

380
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,129
something open-source of the shelf not

381
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:20,970
something the attacker developed and it

382
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,419
was supposed to gather information from

383
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:26,759
the infected device so again like the IP

384
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,279
address the installed antivirus products

385
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,689
etc and upload all of that to a C&C

386
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:37,230
address and that since the address

387
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,139
helped me answer the question of who is

388
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,259
behind this attack because basically the

389
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,449
this website or this CNC used duck DNS

390
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:50,939
or a dynamic DNS so it resolved to a lot

391
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:53,939
of IP addresses and then going over the

392
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,110
going over those IP addresses I saw that

393
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,239
one of them was associated with another

394
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:04,199
domain and that domain was used by this

395
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,500
campaign back in 2017 so it was the C&C

396
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,109
4 other files that were spread by the

397
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,829
Facebook pages

398
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,730
and that other domain unlike the drtc

399
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,199
dns it had Whois information and the

400
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,630
Whois information showed me a name that

401
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,010
I couldn't really get a lot of

402
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,490
information on online but it also had an

403
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,010
email address which again repeated the D

404
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,460
RPC that we see in the hotter website

405
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,730
and looking up this email address I also

406
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,950
saw that it was used to register to

407
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,429
other addresses dexter ly comm and

408
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:47,440
dexter ly dot space and searching for

409
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,039
dexter ly actually led me to a facebook

410
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,500
profile operated by the attacker

411
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,230
so dexter ly was the current avatar of

412
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,519
the attacker behind this campaign and

413
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,590
the prehistory vs avatar as it turns out

414
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,220
was dr. pc which we've seen in the new

415
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,919
web site address and in the gmail email

416
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,210
that was used for registering them and

417
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,769
this Facebook profile I mean if you've

418
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,899
looked at similar attacks it kind of

419
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,870
follows the pattern of attackers of the

420
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,320
sort

421
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,039
he was basically flexing about all of

422
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,159
the achievements and everything that he

423
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,320
did and all of the systems he managed to

424
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,139
infiltrate and basically sharing panels

425
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:35,679
of showing successful infections and

426
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,159
victims that he managed to get to run

427
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,970
the application and what was a bit weird

428
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,889
for me at least observing a lot of

429
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,190
similar threats in the regions that

430
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,620
usually those kind of threat actors

431
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,019
would be like oh look look at the credit

432
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:54,669
cards they managed to steal er look at

433
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,289
the PayPal account and got into and it's

434
00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:00,070
more it's more about bragging in that

435
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,320
sense but this guy was actually sharing

436
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,080
a lot more sensitive information so over

437
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,850
the years I think he managed to infect

438
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,700
thousands of people mostly from Libya

439
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,639
and apparently he also got his hands on

440
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:15,519
a lot of sensitive information by doing

441
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,940
that so we saw that using this Facebook

442
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,029
profile he also used to share a lot of

443
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,879
financial documents that were shared by

444
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,919
the Libyan embassies and Libyan

445
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,460
government and internal information that

446
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,200
wasn't supposed to reach his hands or

447
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,330
anyone else and he can even see him kind

448
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,429
of getting his hands on communications

449
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:38,799
between international companies and the

450
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,570
Libyan government as well so this was

451
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,590
really kind of surprising to see that

452
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,719
despite the basic tools he was using

453
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,179
this was very very successful and did a

454
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,749
lot of harm actually and he even shared

455
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:56,889
some official documents and on his

456
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,599
facebook profile so we can even see that

457
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,029
he got his hands and a couple of copies

458
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:03,339
of diplomatic passports which is funny

459
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:05,229
because this the one on the right

460
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:07,509
actually belongs to the general Marshall

461
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:10,359
to the guy from the initial Facebook

462
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:10,989
page

463
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:13,809
somehow by infecting some guys in device

464
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,779
he got a copy of the diplomatic passport

465
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:21,629
of this guy and that was crazy and

466
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:25,289
seeing just the scope of this attack was

467
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:29,229
again also crazy and we've reported all

468
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,659
of this activity to Facebook so luckily

469
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,570
the dexstar ly profile is down nowadays

470
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,700
all of the pages that were involved are

471
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,149
down and again this guy some of his

472
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:41,830
activity even back in the day and I

473
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,619
realized since later on was also

474
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,589
uncovered by Trend Micro I think back in

475
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:49,989
2017 but he that didn't deter him they

476
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:53,169
still kept at it and this time we took

477
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,649
more strict means in terms of trying to

478
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:58,389
stop him from doing what he's doing and

479
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:00,940
they really hope he doesn't go back to

480
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,969
doing that eventually because he he was

481
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,999
also sharing the fact that he received

482
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,070
emails by the FBI letting him know that

483
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,139
they're aware of his malicious activity

484
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,940
but I think as long as he stays within

485
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,339
Libya he's gonna be off the hook but

486
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,289
just hopefully not doing anything

487
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:24,789
malicious anymore so to conclude this

488
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:28,359
activity has been going on for years I

489
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:31,030
think even more than 2004

490
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,790
theme this goes back to way before that

491
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,430
and in the previous profiles that I've

492
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,240
seen also operated by him he was kind of

493
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,000
also active in 2013 and all different in

494
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,380
different hacking activities and he was

495
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,120
using off-the-shelf tools and I think if

496
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,580
you're kind of working in threat

497
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,650
intelligence or in malware analysis and

498
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,200
whatever that makes our job in terms of

499
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,150
attribution a bit harder because if he's

500
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,910
using his own unique code that's kind of

501
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,070
better for us to track his tools and to

502
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,160
know what is going on there and to be

503
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,410
able to tell when he releases new

504
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,120
samples for example but just knowing

505
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,920
that he is using things like spy note or

506
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,990
engineer at mix it makes it a bit harder

507
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,270
and I think looking at the alternative

508
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,590
of identifying this guy simply by his

509
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,050
grammar mistakes and seeing tracking

510
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,300
this activity by his typos was a nice

511
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,640
alternative in this case that would have

512
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,860
been harder if we were just doing this

513
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,630
simply by looking at the malicious

514
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,790
samples so in terms of threat

515
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,130
intelligence techniques this also kind

516
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,350
of provided me at least with a new way

517
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,580
of looking at things and not just

518
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,440
looking at the malicious code but also

519
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,080
sometimes it's more simple than that you

520
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,420
don't only have to rely on the sample

521
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,260
itself and despite the low

522
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,660
sophistication of those things and the

523
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,490
fact that he was using those open-source

524
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,830
tools we can really see the high impact

525
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,650
of these attacks and I think this really

526
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,360
applies to a lot of threats in the

527
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,790
Middle East the fact that they are not a

528
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,800
very sophisticated man there are very

529
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,330
sophisticated ones don't get me wrong

530
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,490
but despite the fact that they're not

531
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,650
very complex we can really still see

532
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,830
them doing very very high like a lot of

533
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,890
damage simply because they know how to

534
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,990
socially engineer their samples they

535
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,910
know how to reach their victims and they

536
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,300
know how to design the bait for the

537
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,980
people that they are targeting so in

538
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,930
this case we really see the investment

539
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,610
of this guy in the usage of those

540
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,800
Facebook pages with thousands of

541
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,780
followers and trying to keep them as

542
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,570
legitimate as possible and succeeding

543
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,760
throughout all of that into reaching

544
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,910
those people and not really by investing

545
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,720
a lot of effort on the technical side so

546
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,360
I would say that and this may be repeats

547
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,400
what Brian said earlier in the day that

548
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,960
you don't really have to have the most

549
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,030
advanced tools for you to have the

550
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,290
severe impact that this campaign had and

551
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,730
that'd be all for me thank you
