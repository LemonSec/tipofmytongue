1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,049
right that's let's get going so I was I

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,990
was I was in I was in work after having

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,650
we were having a conversation when about

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,710
when we found out that that 'besides was

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,179
gonna be in the Titanic building this

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,400
year and a colleague turned her and says

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,830
to me I bet you someone's going to do a

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,130
talk about the Titanic's of security yes

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,199
yes that's right hi I'm doing a talk

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,320
about the Titanic's of security it's me

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,270
but and some of you might think that

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,920
what you've what you see today would be

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,150
similar to what you might have heard

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,680
from from Brian this morning in the

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,090
keynote but hopefully I've got a more

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,640
positive outlook on this it's my first

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,600
talk can you tell so who on earth who on

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,210
earth am i my name is Jason Holley I'm a

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,650
third year undergrad at Napier doing

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,290
cyber security in forensics on my year

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,850
out at the minute working in threat

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,460
intelligence at a security company I am

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,650
a new guy in four SEC you know first job

24
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,629
still at uni all that sort of stuff but

25
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,509
I'm getting jumping in at the deep end

26
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:09,009
is it worth being at a conference like

27
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:10,990
this and yes I'm originally from

28
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,460
northern and so this is a home

29
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,759
conference for me if you if you feel

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,770
like follow me on Twitter it's at set

31
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,719
Comet there'll be there'll be a feedback

32
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,170
thing going up after there hopefully so

33
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,600
we all know about the story of the

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,149
Titanic when the Titanic sank in 1912

35
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:30,789
after strike striking an iceberg on its

36
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,729
maiden voyage it was the deadliest

37
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,159
marine disaster to happen in peacetime

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,139
to this day I believe and the deaths

39
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,819
depending on what source you look at

40
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,759
anywhere between 15 1600 it was a

41
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,679
horrible tragedy as we know in fact the

42
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:47,109
the experience downstairs in this

43
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:50,020
building is dedicated to to the history

44
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,630
in the memory of of that tragedy and it

45
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,020
was a tragedy but we investigated and we

46
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,539
discovered why it happened and here are

47
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,609
some of the reasons ice warnings that

48
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,049
were given to the crew weren't heeded

49
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,240
they decided to plow full speed straight

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,979
through the straight through the ice

51
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:07,299
field instead of going around it

52
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,770
there was only one life book drill that

53
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,840
was carried out in Southampton the

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,250
lifeboat numbers at the time on most

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,780
ships were dependent on the fact that

56
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,300
there would be other

57
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,250
ships nearby to shuttle those passengers

58
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,530
to the radio officer on a nearby ship

59
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,930
the californium was off duty meaning

60
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,730
that they didn't receive the the message

61
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,580
that satanic was was in need of help the

62
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,020
lifeboats weren't fully stocked and

63
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,840
there was a belief as we know that the

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,390
revolutionary technology meant that the

65
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,820
the ship was unsinkable does that remind

66
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,790
you of anything so yes it was a tragedy

67
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,260
and we found out why but when we found

68
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,300
out why we fixed those problems after

69
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,220
that Titanic sank we got an

70
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,720
international treaty the International

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,010
Convention for the safety of life at sea

72
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,780
and I'm going to look briefly at chapter

73
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,340
chapter 5 which is the only one that

74
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,440
applies to all vessels and most of the

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,270
decisions put into that were as a result

76
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,000
of the Titanic's in sinking there must

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,530
be a lifeboat place for everyone onboard

78
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,990
the radio must be manned 24 hours a day

79
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,580
so you're gonna have to have a rotation

80
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,590
of people Manning it the crew must take

81
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,120
heed of any of those danger warnings

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,340
that they receive and the Masters of all

83
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,920
vessels must offer assistance to any

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,630
ship in distress you'll see that with

85
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,700
Somali piracy even if the Pirates get

86
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,580
shipped gets disabled the navies have to

87
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,580
help them they can't leave them a sea

88
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,810
that may have seen off topic but the

89
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,550
question I'm asking is what is the

90
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,070
InfoSec equivalent of so last what is

91
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,230
more is that requirement that we

92
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,850
implement those lessons that we've

93
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,860
learned across the entire industry and

94
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,960
across the world I'd argue there isn't

95
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,580
some of you might be saying to me well

96
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,070
what about GDP our GDP ours good

97
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,660
legislation I'm not going to knock it

98
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,090
but the issue being that it only applies

99
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,900
where EU citizens are concerned and you

100
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,660
will not know you'll all too often find

101
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,740
especially in America that websites will

102
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,020
simply block EU citizens from accessing

103
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,240
their website in order to get around the

104
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,880
requirement to to comply with gdpr which

105
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,380
isn't great because they should be

106
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,860
complying with every good that if good

107
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,120
legislation comes out whether or not

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,210
you're required to comply with it music

109
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,230
because we should all be invested in

110
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,750
making security better but unfortunately

111
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,280
some people prefer the bottom line over

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,910
everything else audience interaction

113
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,519
question number one can we prevent every

114
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,950
cyberattack who thinks we can good

115
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,490
good yes of course we can't we can't

116
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,830
prevent every cyberattack there are an

117
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,350
unknown amount of unknowns that will

118
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,750
prevent us from from seeing from

119
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,940
detecting and stopping any attack

120
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,250
launched against you wore your the

121
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,620
company that you work for so we're never

122
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,630
going to be able to stop them all but

123
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,700
when they have happened we can

124
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,100
investigate and we can discover why

125
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,520
and sometimes it genuinely users can be

126
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,070
somewhat at fault whether it's through

127
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,620
having weak passwords or falling for for

128
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,050
phishing and that's not exactly great

129
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,380
but they put their trust in us in

130
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,020
security professionals if you like when

131
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,050
they upload their data to two websites

132
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,070
on unto your to your system and we

133
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,980
should and if we are supposedly the

134
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,730
experts then we should not be so we

135
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,560
should not be putting all of our trust

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,140
in them not to fall for phishing or have

137
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,810
a weak password we can advise we you

138
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,400
know we can suggest to people that this

139
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,020
is the way you should do it but we

140
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,070
should always take the worst-case

141
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,590
scenario that people won't so what I'm

142
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,020
gonna do is I'm going to look at three

143
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,750
cyber attacks that have happened and an

144
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,820
establish for you that we can detect

145
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,350
what happened so Ashley Madison the data

146
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,540
breach that happened in 2015 and I know

147
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,790
that's gonna be a bit controversial but

148
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,830
at the end of the day regardless of

149
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,000
whether you think the service should

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,850
exist or not it does exist it's storing

151
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,710
personal information and therefore they

152
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,860
should be doing so in as secure a way as

153
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,810
they can which as it turns out they

154
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,730
weren't necessarily doing there was

155
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,040
there was 125 gigabytes of user data

156
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,340
dating back as far as 2007 that was that

157
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,450
was released to the public including

158
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,820
names emails addresses and credit cards

159
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,190
it was attributed to a group called the

160
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,950
impact team the odds they'd stolen the

161
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,200
data they actually essentially ransomed

162
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,730
Ashley Madison and their parent company

163
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,700
demanding that if the website and the

164
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,140
service wasn't shut down then they would

165
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,570
release the data Ashley Madison didn't

166
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,330
do that and the data got released the

167
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,160
passwords that were were stolen were

168
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,889
encrypted with beef

169
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,139
a relatively secure way of storing of

170
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,150
storing passwords and in fact Robert

171
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,099
Graham CEO an errata SEC said at the

172
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,080
time we're so used to seeing clear text

173
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,240
and md5 hashes it's refreshing to see

174
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,870
bcrypt

175
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,360
actually being used we'll come back to

176
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,199
this later blackmail of individuals who

177
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,689
were whose data was released in this

178
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,870
hack that continues actually to this day

179
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,599
and on a slightly sadder note there are

180
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:08,219
reports that there were individuals who

181
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,319
were so ashamed once their families

182
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,139
discovered that their they'd been using

183
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,569
the service that they actually took

184
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,210
their own lives which just goes to show

185
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,240
that yeah we think that sometimes a

186
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,979
cyber crime is being victimless but it

187
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,250
very much isn't Ashley Madison were

188
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,930
investigated by the US Federal Trade

189
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,219
Commission and they were fined thirty

190
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:30,810
million dollars essentially for their

191
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,779
negligence so what went wrong here with

192
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,669
Ashley Madison well for a start

193
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,379
if you'd been using the service and you

194
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,240
decided I don't want to do this anymore

195
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,219
I don't like what they're doing and you

196
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,409
want to delete your account you have to

197
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,150
pay them to do so you can deactivate

198
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,110
your account for free but if you want to

199
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,520
if you want to actually get them to

200
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,250
remove your data you have to pay them 15

201
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,370
pounds in the UK which which is it's a

202
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,110
nonzero amount of money and most people

203
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,699
aren't gonna want to be paying that and

204
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,189
even in the cases where people did hand

205
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,229
over that money and a lot in a lot of

206
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,969
those cases Ashley Madison just did the

207
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,149
account deactivation and actually didn't

208
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,039
delete those people's data which which

209
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,990
would GDP are enforced nowadays would be

210
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:19,889
a big deal oh another big problem was

211
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:20,789
the fact that there was no email

212
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:22,469
verification when you were creating an

213
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,589
account if you if you put in you know

214
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,629
John at Smith comm is your email address

215
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:30,000
when signing up it would accept that and

216
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,279
not only that there were even if you did

217
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,839
put in a real email address there was no

218
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,698
requirement to confirm that you own that

219
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,289
address before setting up your account

220
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,510
so I could set up an account in the name

221
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,640
of anybody in this room if I felt like

222
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,120
it and then you would have to not only

223
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,070
if you wanted your data to then be

224
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,920
removed you would have to get into that

225
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,470
account that I've created and then pay

226
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,990
to delete it

227
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,270
and as we've seen even then they may not

228
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,240
actually delete your data and you have

229
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,390
to ask yourself if if that if that was

230
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,870
you and your date your data your name

231
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,520
and your email address ended up being in

232
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,260
the in the list of data that was

233
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,350
compromised would anyone close to you

234
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,720
actually believe that it wasn't your

235
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,450
account I don't think they would we we

236
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,250
generally accept that if your emails on

237
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,290
it it's it's your account and then

238
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,029
there's the fact that that users I said

239
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,410
we're not trying to blame users entirely

240
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,310
which we're not but users were using the

241
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,730
same sort of weak passwords as on other

242
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,250
websites except for number nine on that

243
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,760
list which I'm not going to read out I

244
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,500
said we'd come back to this because if

245
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,209
those passwords have encrypted with with

246
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,860
bcrypt it still would have been very

247
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,320
difficult to reverse them to get your

248
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,839
your password back but as it turns out

249
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,839
when Ashley Madison had moved from using

250
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,060
md5 to using bcrypt their md5 hashing

251
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,700
and storage remained active so md5

252
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,440
hashes of people's passwords were being

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,270
stored right alongside the the bcrypt

254
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,640
hash meaning and obviously with these

255
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,040
then weaker passwords that's a lot

256
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,040
easier for for the user I'm sorry for

257
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,570
the attacker to compromised that

258
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,820
password and okay you may have all the

259
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,209
user data anyway but users tend to reuse

260
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:22,160
passwords between different services so

261
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,570
they're likely just going so they're

262
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,640
likely going to then stuff using your

263
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,589
email and that cracked password against

264
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,690
every website they can find to see if

265
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,329
you've been involved so all in all not a

266
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,570
great day for users of Ashley Madison

267
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,100
let's let's move on and look at a

268
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,740
watercraft in 2017 ransomware as I'm

269
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,810
sure you know that encrypted your files

270
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,660
demanded payment in Bitcoin which used

271
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,390
to exploits eternal blue and double

272
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,160
pulsar which were developed by the NSA

273
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,560
who didn't inform Microsoft that they

274
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,209
you were had these vulnerabilities and

275
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,190
then were eventually leaked that stone

276
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,260
slash stolen depending on who you want

277
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,560
to believe an estimated 200,000

278
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,900
computers in over 150 countries were

279
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,089
affected so it's clear at this point

280
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,790
that SCI attackers

281
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,470
don't care about international borders

282
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,720
or jurisdictions they're just going to

283
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,620
attack you wherever you happen to be it

284
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,270
was in tributed to a group called the

285
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,820
Lazarus the largest group who are

286
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,700
believed to be to have originated from

287
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,700
North Korea and it wasn't only

288
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,860
individuals that were affected but some

289
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,870
rather large businesses the NHS in the

290
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,630
UK was affected of the Nissan production

291
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,760
plant in Sunderland actually had to stop

292
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,800
production for a time because all the

293
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,090
computers will be having their data

294
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,500
encrypted and not being able to work

295
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,480
properly and even the German National

296
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,850
Railway Deutsche Bahn they had to their

297
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,860
services were affected when they were

298
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,010
then when they were hit the kills there

299
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,350
was a kill switch in the initial initial

300
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,940
version of wanna cry discovered my

301
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,250
Marcus Hutchins but eventually there

302
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,750
were there were different kill switches

303
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,130
that were were implemented in your

304
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,420
variants that that were discovered and

305
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,010
registered and then that kill switch was

306
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,810
was being used and then eventually a

307
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,430
variant was released that just didn't

308
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,540
bother with kill switches at all you

309
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,390
could argue that one a cry wasn't a very

310
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,920
effective because the ransoms that were

311
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,590
paid only totaled around $100,000

312
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,720
whereas the economic impact was up to

313
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,030
four billion dollars so depends how the

314
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,940
how the enemy was I'm sorry how the

315
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,790
attacker wanted to affect us whether it

316
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,800
was through economic impact or through

317
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,170
actually making money arguably they

318
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,990
succeeded better in that in in causing

319
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,180
economic impact than making their own

320
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,910
money so one of the big issues with

321
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,270
warrior cry is the NSA the NSA were

322
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,870
developing exploits in-house finding

323
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,780
vulnerabilities in the Windows operating

324
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,510
system developing an exploit for it not

325
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,890
to a Microsoft about it because they

326
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,780
didn't want it to be patched they wanted

327
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,600
a chance to to use those and and who

328
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,920
knows who they were trying to use them

329
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,300
against an argument and arguably they

330
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,630
they shouldn't have been doing that but

331
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,190
Microsoft did eventually discover those

332
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,570
vulnerabilities on their own and release

333
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,670
patches but as usual a lot of

334
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,800
organizations were either using

335
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,540
operating systems over end-of-life

336
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,230
or

337
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,610
they weren't updating their systems

338
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,890
because they were too worried about

339
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,800
breaking core functionality and that

340
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,180
could be the case with feature updates

341
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,860
sometimes anyone who uses Windows 10

342
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,390
will know that you update and

343
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,370
everything's broken or all your files

344
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,790
are gone and it's not a fun time but

345
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,410
with security updates you would like to

346
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,150
hope that more people would be more that

347
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,950
people would be more responsive although

348
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,170
it isn't always the case the kill

349
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,110
switches were were found and registered

350
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,700
which is really a case of six of one and

351
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,460
half a dozen of the other because you

352
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,780
either don't register the kill switch

353
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,490
and it doesn't do anything or you

354
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,350
register the kill switch and the hackers

355
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,790
just go and change the kill switch or

356
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,980
eventually just remove the kill switch

357
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,870
entirely so now you have no way to stop

358
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,670
it but you would also have no way to

359
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,020
stop it if you chose not to register

360
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,900
your kill switch so that really is a

361
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,130
case of six and one and a half a dozen

362
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,990
and the other there isn't no win in that

363
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,600
situation and some people didn't keep

364
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,100
data backups they weren't they weren't

365
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,010
keeping backups of the critical data so

366
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,630
if they were hit with one a cry and

367
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,720
their data was encrypted they the data

368
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,120
wasn't was genuinely at risk whereas if

369
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,150
you've got backups you just we re image

370
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,710
from your backup job done and you're

371
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,100
back up and running another issue is

372
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,590
that people actually paid the ransom

373
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,440
that was being demanded which if you ask

374
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,450
anyone who works in in law enforcement

375
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,980
they'll generally tell you that in a

376
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,350
ransom situation paying it is sometimes

377
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,230
the worst thing you can do when you're

378
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,340
demanding payment in Bitcoin

379
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,440
particularly there's no way to track

380
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,900
where that money is going to so there's

381
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,310
there's no chance of you identifying

382
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,890
who's who's it who's to blame or or

383
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,050
getting your money back you could easily

384
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,870
be targeted again you could pay the

385
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,150
ransom say for example your files

386
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,460
actually get decrypted which there's no

387
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,590
guarantee and then you go connect to a

388
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,080
network and the computer spreads want to

389
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,790
cry back to you and then you're in the

390
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,730
same situation again and you're open

391
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,110
you're marking yourself essentially as

392
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,150
vulnerable or willing to compromise you

393
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,550
know oh if I if I blackmail this person

394
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,260
for money that they're going to they're

395
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,240
going to pay up and you open yourself up

396
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
potentially to further attacks there

397
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,200
were actually people afterward after

398
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,040
wanna cry were sending out emails to as

399
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,030
many people

400
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,550
just as they could find saying I am the

401
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,770
creator of one to wanna cry if you do

402
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,840
not give me money I will delete all your

403
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,370
files this time and you will never get

404
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,060
them back

405
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,310
who knows if they were actually those

406
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,070
individuals are not so so ransomware is

407
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,690
is no different to any other physical

408
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,880
ransom situation you should under no

409
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,900
circumstances pay up let's move on to

410
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,110
two Equifax in 2017 a data breach of 146

411
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,920
million records that's basically half of

412
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,630
the u.s. population which which is a lot

413
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,520
of people and not only that but the data

414
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,130
data lead was very was was critical if

415
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,600
you've if you if you know anyone in

416
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,220
America they have the social security

417
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,470
number which has no security features

418
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,660
built in and with just name birth date

419
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,700
and social security number you can do a

420
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,830
lot you can get credit in someone's name

421
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,870
you could get medical treatment under

422
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,820
their name and take their records you

423
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,290
could steal their their benefits or

424
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,420
their tax refunds from the IRS and you

425
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,160
can commit crimes and mix up criminal

426
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,960
records which could be very difficult to

427
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,020
fix afterwards

428
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,010
Equifax came about from essentially just

429
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,630
individuals scanning the web and saying

430
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,580
oh we know there's a vulnerability let's

431
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,020
scan the web to see if we can find any

432
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,490
servers that have that are vulnerable to

433
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,530
it and they did they found three that

434
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,720
belong to Equifax and were able to get

435
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,300
the credentials to these the service

436
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,310
which were promptly then used against

437
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,400
every other Equifax own server they

438
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,099
could find and it worked for another 48

439
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,800
servers so clearly credential reuse was

440
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,260
involved here an arguable and arguably

441
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,420
these these hackers were were smart

442
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,430
because they exposed rated their data

443
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,530
slowly knowing that if they tried to

444
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,060
bring it out all in one big lump they

445
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,069
were almost certain to be detected and

446
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,380
potentially stopped but by doing it more

447
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,720
slowly they bought themselves time to

448
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,980
get all the data out without being

449
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,130
detected

450
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,200
so updates are rearing their ugly head

451
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,850
again when it comes to Equifax the the

452
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,150
vulnerability that was used had a patch

453
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,660
released by Apache on March 8

454
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,850
2017 and the attack didn't start to

455
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,760
March 10th you might say well that's not

456
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,270
a long a lot that's not very long and if

457
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,840
you had a large amount of large amount

458
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,790
of service like Equifax do to update you

459
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,050
might not get round to getting them all

460
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,370
done in time

461
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,640
but in but when it comes to Equifax they

462
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,850
only had to update those three and the

463
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,020
attack may have been stopped in its

464
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,070
entirety password reuse was also a

465
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,110
problem like I said the the hackers only

466
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,610
got the credentials for three service

467
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,040
but these ended up being valid for

468
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,410
another forty eight service we can all

469
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,570
do Matson and that's that's fifty one

470
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,760
servers in total there you go access to

471
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,130
only from from compromising come from

472
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,920
comprising two three directly if Equifax

473
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,200
have been using unique credentials and

474
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,090
passwords for every server that they had

475
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,000
then the data stolen may have only been

476
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,950
the data from those three servers rather

477
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,370
than the 48 others a lot of people never

478
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,230
gave their data to Equifax as a credit

479
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,840
monitoring firm they buy data from God

480
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,550
knows how many different sources and

481
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,760
then it's it's all stored there and you

482
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,230
may not know that they've ever obtained

483
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,170
your data which isn't great and in fact

484
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,960
in the you arguably it's unlawful now

485
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,080
because you need and you need

486
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,100
individuals to opt in to their data

487
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,230
being collected by third parties before

488
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,910
it you can actually do so lawfully

489
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,810
whenever facts discovered that they've

490
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,670
been hacked there was a period of about

491
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,580
six weeks where they kept it to

492
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,720
themselves they didn't release that

493
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,600
information publicly which argue which

494
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,150
is not a good idea when the the those

495
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,980
individuals affected their data was was

496
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,970
already in the wild and excuse me they

497
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,530
were they were hiding essentially the

498
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,940
fact that they had been breached rather

499
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,160
than allowing those people to to fix or

500
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,990
to at least know that their data might

501
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,580
be out there and to look for suspicious

502
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,180
activity and arguably this was done to

503
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,700
give Equifax executives time to sell

504
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,530
their stocks because they knew that as

505
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,880
soon as that news of the attack went

506
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,470
there their stock would just go through

507
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,350
the floor

508
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,840
although they claimed it was it was time

509
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,860
that they used to conduct an

510
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,330
investigation arguably both are true the

511
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,950
the website that they then set up to

512
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,029
tell individuals if they've been

513
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,039
affected because remember not everyone

514
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,490
whose data was in that breach actually

515
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,620
gave it to Equifax in the first place

516
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,350
was was poor not only was the the web

517
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,200
address they used sounded like a fish an

518
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,159
account an actual phishing website with

519
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,509
a similar name but with the word swat

520
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:35,590
round was set up an E and the official

521
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,960
Equifax Twitter started tweeting about

522
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,909
that

523
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:42,100
so essentially Equifax were were

524
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,649
promoting fishing against their own data

525
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:47,950
subjects and not only that but the

526
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,980
system itself was was poorly constructed

527
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,389
depending on what device you used or

528
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:53,980
what browser you used or even just

529
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,019
randomly from from check to check it

530
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,460
would change its mind between you've

531
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,139
been involved you've not been involved

532
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:02,230
which isn't great so we've established

533
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,779
that we can't we can always investigate

534
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,940
after these attacks happen and we can

535
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,519
determine for the most part the the

536
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,240
reasons why they happened the causes and

537
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,919
what we could have done in hindsight

538
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,649
which is of course 20/20 that we could

539
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,779
have we could have done and if we had

540
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,730
done would have prevented or minimize

541
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,289
the effect of those attacks that

542
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,840
happened so if we can do that

543
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,350
why the similar attacks still happen you

544
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,350
know why do we see companies soaring our

545
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,049
hashing passwords with md5 reusing

546
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,049
credentials not updating their servers

547
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:40,769
when security vulnerabilities come out

548
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,909
arguably it's because that point of view

549
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:45,970
that we have where we're all in our own

550
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,039
little box and we don't want to to share

551
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,990
anything because we're afraid of either

552
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,000
letting out intellectual property or

553
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,460
afraid that we we are going to embarrass

554
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,100
ourselves either to to the customers of

555
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,600
of your organization or or to to rival

556
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,360
organizations and despite the fact that

557
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,250
despite the fact that these individuals

558
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,980
still despite the fact that they they

559
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,070
don't share and it

560
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,049
leads to this this issue of hiding

561
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,899
ourselves away rather than sharing and

562
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,909
trying to make security better for

563
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,519
everyone and those those really are two

564
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,139
different cultures of the blame culture

565
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,359
and the just culture and at the minute

566
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,909
to insecurity the vast majority of

567
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:33,639
organizations are in this blame culture

568
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,739
where they're focused on concealing

569
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:39,409
their mistakes or blaming those mistakes

570
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,210
entirely on one individual and saying

571
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,399
you know it's your fault you're fired

572
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,470
get rid of that person we fix the

573
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,729
problem well probably haven't it's in a

574
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:50,840
blown culture you're going to be more

575
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,460
focused on protecting the bottom line

576
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,009
rather than protecting your data and it

577
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:57,019
does lead to this this security theater

578
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:59,989
an illusion that you've got effective

579
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:04,159
security when if you you look deep you

580
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,869
know if you ask yourself honestly that

581
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:08,059
there is there are going to be holes in

582
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,619
your security there are going to be ways

583
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:13,340
in but you pretend oh yes we're we're a

584
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,169
Basti and no one's no one's getting into

585
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:17,210
our system and if you're pretending like

586
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,249
that's the case someone's probably

587
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:21,529
already in your system well we should be

588
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,149
doing is we should be focusing more on

589
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:25,729
on shipping and aviation and having this

590
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:29,859
just culture of saying okay we messed up

591
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,779
what could we have done let's implement

592
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:36,470
that and arguably let's then share that

593
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,159
to the world and say look we have made a

594
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,200
mistake but we know how to stop this

595
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,450
mistake happening for everyone here is

596
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,279
how to do it you know you install this

597
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,200
patch you you stop doing this or you

598
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,090
stop hashing your passwords with md5

599
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,070
arguably that's an obvious lesson but I

600
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,289
keep coming back to it as an example and

601
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,659
that will that will lead over time to a

602
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,450
sharing of security best practice among

603
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,669
everyone where because everyone is

604
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,529
sharing none of us are particularly

605
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:07,340
shamed or embarrassed to say look I made

606
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,099
a mistake or we've made a mistake rather

607
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:12,950
as an organization but we're fixing it

608
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,720
just like every other organization is

609
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,330
doing and here is some information on

610
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,399
how you could prevent this happening to

611
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,349
yourselves in the future rather the

612
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:24,019
minute where if an organization gets

613
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,909
compromised all the rivals just go ha ha

614
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:29,419
ha they got hacked which is which is not

615
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:29,880
the

616
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,550
not the ideal solution because likely if

617
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,830
they've already been compromised in a

618
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,660
particular manner that attacker is

619
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,340
coming after everyone in that in that

620
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,910
business area and as I mentioned and as

621
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,760
you would have heard from as you would

622
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,920
have heard from Brian this morning

623
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,020
that's used more commonly in aviation

624
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,530
and indeed also in shipping which is

625
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,170
which is hopefully gives reason to to my

626
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,710
lecturing on the Titanic earlier by the

627
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,320
way go downstairs if you want more more

628
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,180
more on the Titanic you won't get that

629
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,200
much from me but but other industries

630
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,240
have learnt this already they've like

631
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,980
shipping in aviation and others they've

632
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,670
learned that it's better to say okay we

633
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,140
made a mistake we have found out exactly

634
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,210
what happened and then tell everyone

635
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,160
here is how you stop this from happening

636
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,880
ever again and for the motifs alting in

637
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,070
the most part you don't see the same

638
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,210
shipping disaster or the same aviation

639
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,210
disaster happening more than once

640
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,000
ideally or certainly no more than a

641
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,070
couple of times you know we don't hear

642
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,720
of aircraft running out of fuel

643
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,470
constantly we don't hear of ships

644
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,400
hitting icebergs down the side and

645
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,750
destroying all our wats tight

646
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,190
compartments happening every every time

647
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,600
so I guess what I'm saying is that we

648
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,280
should move to this just culture and in

649
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,250
some ways some parts of cybersecurity

650
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,570
are already doing this a lot of

651
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,490
organizations are putting security text

652
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,460
information on their web sites where if

653
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,650
you if you know of a problem in our

654
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,320
organization a security issue you go to

655
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,390
their website slash security text and

656
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,830
there's all the information you need to

657
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,960
contact them and report that rather than

658
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,490
hiding themselves away and going we're

659
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,810
not telling you anything you know we're

660
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,430
a bastion we're invulnerable they're

661
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,980
saying okay we might be vulnerable if we

662
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,140
are please tell us we want to know I'm

663
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,910
bug bounties are another good way of

664
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,430
doing that and put offering a financial

665
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,860
reward for through doing it now we're

666
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,170
not going to solve every problem just

667
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,700
with a text file or with always bug

668
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,330
bounties but already in the UK at least

669
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:42,690
we

670
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,789
the national cybersecurity center who

671
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:49,200
will get involved with liaison with

672
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,349
organizations who are either in the

673
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,059
middle of an attack or whether an attack

674
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,220
has happened to help them in whatever

675
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,859
way they can and they can glean bits of

676
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,299
information that from that that can then

677
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,359
be anonymized and shared with other

678
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,239
organizations and arguably this is the

679
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,190
way aviation works as well each country

680
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,159
having its own organization that deals

681
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,729
with the the aftermath the discovering

682
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:18,059
why or how and then sharing that

683
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,570
although arguably there's less

684
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,529
anonymizing of the data there because

685
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:23,820
you can't really conceal the fact that

686
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,909
your ship sank or your plane crashed but

687
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:28,470
we could do more

688
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,929
we're not perfect at all and in fact

689
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:35,849
what we are dealing here or what I think

690
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:37,830
we ideally need is some sort of

691
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,019
equivalent of Solace a global

692
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,479
requirement to implement lesson the

693
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,830
lessons that we've learned from previous

694
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,989
attacks so we don't see them happening

695
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:51,139
again we need that that global

696
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:53,519
essentially legislation you know a

697
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,879
convention whatever you want to call it

698
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:59,700
to say that yes in our country when we

699
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,799
find out this has happened we are going

700
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,479
or we find out that there's a particular

701
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:05,970
particular way that organization can be

702
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,309
attacked we are going to require every

703
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:10,320
organization that does business in our

704
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,989
country to fix it and and you might

705
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:16,729
think you know what I'm dreaming but

706
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,830
well if we're if we're dreaming then you

707
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,169
know the sky is the limit and I'd say we

708
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:24,809
we should we should be aiming as usual

709
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:27,539
for the best possible security that we

710
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,019
can I would love to if if they decide to

711
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,849
have me back to say to be back at a

712
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,619
besides Belfast in in five years time

713
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,539
saying you know what guys we've done it

714
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,570
we found and we found an equivalent of

715
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,460
solace for cybersecurity and it's

716
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,399
implemented across most of the world and

717
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,690
that would be that would that would be

718
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,960
great I'd love to I'd be I'd be happy to

719
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,330
see that and I hope you would too so

720
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,089
essentially what I'm saying is that

721
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:56,279
within within the future I want to be

722
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:56,559
able

723
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,080
say that you know what security within

724
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,330
just about every organization is built

725
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,240
from disaster and I'm that hopefully

726
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,009
positive forward-looking thought I think

727
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:08,049
yeah we're coming to the end of the time

728
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:10,899
so that's all thank you very much for

729
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,279
your time and if you have any questions

730
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:21,820
feel free thank you Jason we will hope

731
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,240
to see you back in five years any

732
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,220
questions come on people we have some

733
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:34,629
time ah you were very very clear sorry

734
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:36,549
tell us about solace is up to do with

735
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:38,379
ships's look yes so it's an

736
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:41,259
international convention for safety of

737
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,059
life at sea as its called

738
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:47,379
I think so 99% of shipping by tonnage is

739
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:50,049
registered to a a nation that has agreed

740
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,139
to it and it sets out safety standards

741
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:56,379
that are mostly come from lessons

742
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:59,080
learned in in tragedies and if you are

743
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,480
if you're if you register your ship say

744
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,460
in the UK which is a nation that has

745
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,649
signed up to so lass there are these

746
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:07,149
minimum standards of safety that you

747
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:11,169
must adhere to which would ideally lead

748
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:15,970
to so it would mean that the the

749
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,289
incidence and the tragedies that have

750
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,179
happened in the past would hopefully not

751
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:20,049
occur in the future

752
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:30,220
I was reading the pan test partners find

753
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,220
a box attached to a ship's network and

754
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,289
no one knew what it was but they worked

755
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:36,700
out advanced-level it was the owners

756
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,049
didn't order was it was no and then

757
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:40,899
trade medicine for it I mean is it that

758
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:45,279
good service so so less focused more on

759
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,159
on on safety rather that than

760
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,649
cybersecurity if you could argue that

761
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,909
that global emphasis of cybersecurity

762
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:57,070
that I would ideally like to see would

763
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,480
be what would prevent that sort of that

764
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,519
sort of cyber incident from happening

765
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,990
another question yep

766
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,620
so I worked in an industry in which most

767
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,629
of our revenue comes from maritime

768
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:18,429
customers and we do specifically

769
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:21,700
connectivity for the maritime sector and

770
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,350
aviation as well and yes as as our

771
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,629
lovely speaker said a lot of those

772
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,879
regulations are based mostly around

773
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:34,629
safety and my particular company not to

774
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:37,929
put in a plug but we are looking to

775
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,690
increase our security at the edge so

776
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,940
that way the connectivity that goes

777
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,059
through to ships and not just for safety

778
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:48,309
purposes but also for just end-user

779
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,490
connectivity for crew members or for the

780
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,190
business capabilities there is a lot of

781
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,779
research and funding and development

782
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:58,090
going into that because there are

783
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,440
vulnerabilities there and that's

784
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,230
something that it's definitely in need

785
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,570
of being addressed and is being

786
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,389
addressed if that helps any Cheers any

787
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,928
more yep

788
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:17,320
next time you sit somewhere up front the

789
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,169
season Thanks so one of the big drivers

790
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:25,929
for adopting aviation safety standards

791
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:28,179
was the use of shared resources like

792
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,070
airports you went to lighty an airline

793
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,570
wasn't allowed to use an airport unless

794
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,519
it was signed up to the standard do you

795
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,490
think there's any equivalent for IT and

796
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,769
so on that we could use to drive

797
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:43,090
something like those standards arguably

798
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,539
arguably the cloud would could be that

799
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,999
that requirement you know Google Cloud

800
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:52,539
or Azure AWS could could be it could be

801
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,999
game changes and drive forward this by

802
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:56,950
introducing a stand a standard of

803
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,809
security within your organization and

804
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,330
say hey if you want to use our service

805
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,159
you have to comply with this standard

806
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,049
and if you don't well then our doors are

807
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:12,039
closed to you all right any more no okay

808
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:14,679
we have short lunch break sorry coffee

809
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:17,769
break and we will be back here at 11:45

810
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:19,659
for the next speaker and thank you again

811
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:21,500
Jason and

812
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,650
thanks guys
