1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,139
so I'm really pleased to have the

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,570
opportunity to speak to you today this

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,059
isn't a talk that I have given anywhere

4
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:15,619
else and it's a blend and artisanal

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,630
blend of some talks that I have given in

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,540
the past so to give if you don't know

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,620
who I am which you probably don't

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,090
probably thinking who the hell is she I

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,420
don't work for any big tech orgs I do a

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,910
lot of work on the consumer privacy side

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,140
volunteer wise I work with a lot of

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,390
at-risk groups so domestic abuse

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,789
survivors sex workers people about who

14
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:40,489
may need some security awareness that

15
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:41,870
takes into consideration their

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,760
particular risk scenarios and that isn't

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,559
something that information security as a

18
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,179
whole is terribly good at dealing with

19
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:52,670
I'm also a survivor of intimate partner

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,999
abuse so I have that perspective so some

21
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:59,569
of the talk is going to talk about those

22
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:01,969
kind of issues around intimate partner

23
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,280
abuse they won't be anything any kind of

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,780
graphic slides or anything like that or

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,850
graphic descriptions but just to let you

26
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,920
know if that is something also I'm a

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,509
woman with fairly strong opinions so if

28
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:13,100
that upsets any of you now is the time

29
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,659
to leave I've got a QR code there with

30
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,570
with link to my blog trap and that's

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,670
what we call raccoons in America where I

32
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,619
very sadly had to come back from last

33
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,299
year and I still miss it so if anybody

34
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,119
happens to go to America or a lot on can

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,740
bring me some stuff from Target I would

36
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,789
love that

37
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,500
or if you wanna hire me just go to

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,479
America and just do nothing and I'll

39
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,979
just go to Target occasionally that

40
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,270
would be quite nice as well I can work

41
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,039
remote so yeah and one of the things as

42
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,469
well I wanted I kind of wanted a blend

43
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:46,850
this inside I think we talked about

44
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,369
security awareness in the right way I

45
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,560
think we need to improve it and I think

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,090
we need to move it towards harm

47
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,549
reduction harm reduction I mean that by

48
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,429
what I mean by that is are we looking

49
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:01,429
after people who are at risk so you know

50
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:04,219
from my perspective of a survivor when

51
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,170
you have to leave and you have to

52
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,649
restart again are these other processes

53
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,480
we have particularly in customer-facing

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,460
rolls when we deal with secure things

55
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,970
such as anti-fraud customer service we

56
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,440
talk about customer service being the

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,810
the weakest link and all that coating

58
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,180
and people tend to go on about an attack

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,920
customer service reps and I'll come for

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,580
that I think we need to completely kind

61
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,820
of shift our paradigm if you like about

62
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,110
what we're talking about when we talk

63
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,350
about security awareness so what I hope

64
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,210
you'll get from this talk by the end of

65
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,760
it is I've got four to five minutes

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
basically to save the world I'd like us

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,760
to know where I think in my opinion

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,010
security awareness is going wrong and

69
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,730
how we can kind of work towards making

70
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,560
that better and build in some harm

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,170
reduction which is really important for

72
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,130
all of us really also hopefully and I

73
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,870
think the first thing we really need to

74
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,280
look at is privacy we all assume when

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,530
we're talking about security awareness

76
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,020
and doing all those a lovely PowerPoint

77
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,510
things you have to click through and

78
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,489
he's talking about fish fish fish and

79
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,560
all this language and malware and all

80
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,650
the rest of it and we assume that people

81
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,560
are coming from the same point of view

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,030
right but we're not the very first thing

83
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,830
I ever published on information security

84
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,870
platform by the way I'm not you know a

85
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,870
technical person I don't work for a big

86
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,000
tech org so I'm quite an easy target for

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,010
all those lovely people on the internet

88
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,980
but I probably something on an

89
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,270
information security platform which I

90
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,690
won't name and I mentioned about that I

91
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,610
said this basically and I said the

92
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,700
problem with its established practice is

93
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,270
that we we share passwords and we think

94
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,930
that's normal

95
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,520
and so coercive control stalkers just

96
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,400
fraud generally is quite easy to get

97
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,870
past even if you're not a stalker if

98
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,390
you're just a fraud fraud star if you're

99
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,670
phoning in to a company it's quite easy

100
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,930
to get around those because we just

101
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,580
don't have the same practices we think

102
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,200
actually it's fairly normal to share

103
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,130
passwords and I had a load of people

104
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,988
come on they're security professionals

105
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,419
come on and tell me that that was wrong

106
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,770
that they share password

107
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,729
with their girlfriends with their

108
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,949
significant others and they can't tell

109
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,169
me that that I shouldn't be doing that

110
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,169
and that's completely normal and I'm not

111
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:35,669
saying my point wasn't that they were

112
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:38,270
wrong for doing that my point was that

113
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,770
it's the reason why we have half these

114
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,650
issues is because we assume that what we

115
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,690
want from privacy what we say is private

116
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,210
or secure is what other people consider

117
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,389
to be you know private and secure and

118
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,360
you know just like you know wearing a

119
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,319
seatbelt or smoking a real cigarette or

120
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,069
being in a relationship with a

121
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,990
conservative Prime Minister we all know

122
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,919
that those are really really inadvisable

123
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,780
things that you should do and if you do

124
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,340
do those then risks yours right but we

125
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,800
don't have the same thing with privacy

126
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,759
or with security we just don't empower

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,710
people and I don't mean empower in a

128
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,219
kind of yogur way I mean it in a kind of

129
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,289
fluffy way I mean it and this has been

130
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,270
said in other talks already today we

131
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,610
don't let people make those choices we

132
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,210
don't educate them and and then that's

133
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,310
what we have the problems ok so what I

134
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,349
want in privacy is very different to

135
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,979
what my children think I should expect

136
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:43,590
and again even with that if I say well I

137
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,940
like to go to the bathroom alone I'll

138
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,099
still have other parents say I love it

139
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,479
when they follow me and it's really nice

140
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
it's a bonding experience ok that's

141
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,130
still we still need around whatever

142
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,020
somebody's saying about privacy security

143
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,120
we need people to say actually that's

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,889
not right that's not normal

145
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,360
okay if you're choosing to go away from

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,849
that to deviate fine but you're doing

147
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:05,069
that knowing your risk and we're not

148
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,710
doing that

149
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,139
okay I actually spoke to I added this I

150
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,909
kind of just switch this around this

151
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,169
lyza something slightly different

152
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,940
earlier I was talking to Brian hone and

153
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,550
earlier and he said but basically we

154
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,080
should talk about resilience more and

155
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,430
this is something that we don't mean I

156
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,139
know I work in schools quite a bit and

157
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,779
when we're talking about we talk about

158
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,219
threat model a lot and when you talk

159
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,169
about threats that makes people feel

160
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,909
especially when I work on a consumer

161
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,110
side a lot it makes people feel quite

162
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,180
uneasy so I think if we talk about risk

163
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,979
scenarios and if you talk about making

164
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,380
people resilient

165
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,840
have more success if you talk about

166
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,790
security if you talk about privacy

167
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,120
they're going to switch off potentially

168
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,960
okay

169
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,180
and also there's a lot of other language

170
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,240
we use and I will give you some an

171
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,730
example of this a little further along

172
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,730
because I worked for a company during a

173
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,870
breach in fact they had the breach my

174
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,790
first day and I was hired to do their

175
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,370
security awareness and that was a really

176
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,520
good ride I can tell you so and I work

177
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,030
with their customer service team and the

178
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,190
they just switched off they because they

179
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,390
were being told that it was their fault

180
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,790
and you know words like pentest malware

181
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,250
I don't know all these things they're

182
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,900
just the vulnerability they mean nothing

183
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,520
when people think they're being attacked

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,320
and people think that they're it's their

185
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,540
fault or you know I'm never going to get

186
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,010
it was just these computer people

187
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,840
telling me about stuff I need to do and

188
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,780
it's so this is something that I think

189
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,010
we need to look at as well and we're

190
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,470
looking at security and privacy and harm

191
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,690
reduction and particularly and we look

192
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,300
at when we look at customer service and

193
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,600
customer facing teams most of us will

194
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,390
have got one of these or when you go

195
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,630
online to chat if it's not a bot it's

196
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,310
will be even if it's a boy it will have

197
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,380
a name they'll be made up but quite a

198
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,220
lot of customer facing roles involve

199
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,530
giving people's real names and this

200
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,450
particular pass and I've very badly

201
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,590
blacks and I was going to put somebody

202
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,150
else's face on like Nicolas Cage or

203
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,160
something but I've anonymize this is the

204
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,510
best I can but I went on because I

205
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,190
thought maybe it's not real name cuz I

206
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,420
actually find this quite horrible

207
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,160
anywhere hate this tracking stuff

208
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,990
because you can track these poor drivers

209
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,150
all day and I can just stop to go for a

210
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,530
restroom break and you're still tracking

211
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,360
them you can imagine the hassle they get

212
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,030
and that the targets that they're

213
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,760
working towards it must be a horrible

214
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,440
job and this was seized for your name

215
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,480
he's got a LinkedIn profile he so I went

216
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,940
everywhere did a whole load of research

217
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,440
on him and every time I get something

218
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,080
like this and you can try it to you not

219
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
for any nefarious reasons but just to

220
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,340
horrify yourself that then opens their

221
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,429
mouth doesn't it to abuse to harm and

222
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,240
things like that

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,940
and so how can we when we it's fishy and

224
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,010
when I was on this customer service team

225
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,310
we were we

226
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,080
had this breach and we they give us a

227
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,810
three line script - we weren't allowed

228
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,700
to deviate from when every when angry

229
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,529
customers called in in all these

230
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,950
different languages and they were

231
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,320
actually everybody's very smart and

232
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,450
could have learned more about securities

233
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,470
that have been properly trained in

234
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,170
awareness but they were using their real

235
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,730
names as well so you've got an irate

236
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,529
customer are talking to a customer

237
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:19,110
service rep and we that's opening us up

238
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,300
or them up to getting loads more abuse

239
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,010
being followed home in all these things

240
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,420
as people don't think they don't make

241
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,240
the connection always between their home

242
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,370
and their work good security awareness

243
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,650
should make you do that it should show

244
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,740
you what risks are what security is make

245
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,080
you think about privacy and it should

246
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,160
show you that the things that you're

247
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,470
doing at works protect yourself and the

248
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,089
systems and the data at work and all the

249
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:43,890
rest of it are also things that you can

250
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,310
do at home but if we are allowing this

251
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,380
kind of things happen at work then we're

252
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,360
basically saying well who cares about

253
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,400
privacy who cares about the fact that

254
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,320
we're using your real name I think it

255
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,510
should be false names I honestly think

256
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,980
it should be a fake name I don't need to

257
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,900
know his real name I could be always

258
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,560
number or something he's still traceable

259
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,790
they could make him be called Jack or

260
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,050
something I don't know

261
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,540
because if there's also here in my

262
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,250
country at the moment in England that's

263
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,380
you know a lovely non-racist place as

264
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,640
well so you've got these people who are

265
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,230
going to be opened up to all sorts of

266
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,220
abuse because they've got a foreign

267
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,380
sounding name it's possibly my most one

268
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,790
of the most controversial slides of open

269
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,660
for up but like I said when I put my

270
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,400
stuff about intimate partner abuse about

271
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,980
coercive control up and I thought a long

272
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,360
and hard before I published it and he

273
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,980
takes a lot when you're not you know

274
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,900
technical person when you're not working

275
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,030
for a tech company it takes a lot to

276
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,930
post stuff and and you know you get

277
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,250
these people who are working in

278
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,529
technical roles and I think you probably

279
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,170
all know them just because you have

280
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,060
learnt to code doesn't mean you're

281
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,070
interested in security we had our breach

282
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,510
okay any won't worse over our breach it

283
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,680
was anything to do with me I joined the

284
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,130
company wasn't my fault but I'd already

285
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,990
flagged up a few issues with them I star

286
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,550
there on Monday on the Monday we have

287
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,930
this pretty she took from six hours to

288
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,520
mention it to me or anybody else in the

289
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,000
team and then when you know when I went

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,339
through it with them and I said well you

291
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,050
know how did this happen

292
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,560
because we we had to notify the entire

293
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,690
client database obviously under Duty PR

294
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,630
that there had been an incident as we

295
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,880
were calling it not a bridge but it was

296
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,170
bridge and we had people over the

297
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,839
subsequent two-three weeks saying that I

298
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,140
deleted my account why am I getting this

299
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,260
notification and when I went inside

300
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,310
because I said well how come that's

301
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,160
happening and I said oh yeah we didn't

302
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
our delete account button it went

303
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,709
nowhere I didn't do anything it's just

304
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,440
it was just you just pressed it it just

305
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,540
looked like he did something so that was

306
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,160
for a platform that was very recently

307
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,880
created these are you know these are

308
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,740
senior front-end engineers on their

309
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,839
LinkedIn profile or on you know on the

310
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,120
company slag basically they were kicking

311
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,620
me off flack chats every five minutes

312
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,690
because I was saying we know do you not

313
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,029
think that we should have had a delete

314
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,820
your account button a year ago when gdpr

315
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,860
was about to be launched or just just

316
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,250
generally ethically as a thing when

317
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,040
you're designing and a platform a

318
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,959
service a platform should people not

319
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,399
have the right to be forgotten and the

320
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,200
right to delete their accounts when

321
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,540
you're designing that now we just made

322
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,959
the decision not to so and that happens

323
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,089
everywhere it's not every time I tell

324
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,220
this story and I won't say where it was

325
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,860
or anything else on that but every time

326
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,270
I tell this story somebody says yeah

327
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,980
that happens at my place yeah gosh and

328
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,200
everybody's got similar story just

329
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,709
because you are in these roles security

330
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,060
for a lot of people it's just a paycheck

331
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,649
it's just something they can make money

332
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,480
out of and we see this a lot with

333
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,060
awareness I works in security awareness

334
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,910
with some vendors for a while and it's

335
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,209
it's horrifying there's just so much

336
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,279
noise around it and everybody wants to

337
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,020
use the latest buzzwords and quite a lot

338
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,250
of them don't know anything about

339
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,589
security at all and you'll know that if

340
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:08,459
you've ever had to sit through a

341
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,899
security awareness thing that's been

342
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,820
training that's been made by an outside

343
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,380
vendor quite often

344
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,080
it's just been googled and then paste it

345
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,220
in and it doesn't really teach you

346
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,050
anything apart from the fact you might

347
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,720
learn that there's some new term for

348
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,810
some type of fishing but that's about it

349
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,240
and I think when we're when we're

350
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,380
designing all these things and we're

351
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,180
talking about security when we're

352
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,470
talking about privacy when we're talking

353
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,360
about security awareness we have to make

354
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,910
sure that I think we have to make sure

355
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,220
we're training people to understand like

356
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,900
I said to understand that their home and

357
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,190
their work is those practices work the

358
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,350
same basically you can still secure your

359
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,420
home printer the way that you would not

360
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,730
use admin admin if you're if you've got

361
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,520
the you know the the credentials for

362
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,550
anything the access to anything right

363
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,880
and you know we're looking up to people

364
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,370
like Mark Zuckerberg as icons because

365
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,750
they happen to run a platform that

366
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,820
doesn't mean he's a good person that

367
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,610
doesn't mean he has security and privacy

368
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,940
top of his agenda every morning just

369
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,890
means he happens to create something so

370
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,840
that's what we have to start and I think

371
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,490
the people who I was working with on

372
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,920
that tech team they weren't a security

373
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,930
team we didn't have anybody in security

374
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,850
we had the chief privacy officer who

375
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,870
left and who was complicit with that

376
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,430
entire thing about their delete your

377
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,590
account button not going anywhere but

378
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,620
nobody had ever really told them about

379
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,480
you know I don't think had ever really

380
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,860
trained them they'd learn how to code

381
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,060
but they've never really thought about

382
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,120
ethics about harm and if we don't learn

383
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,620
about ethics and that's not just right

384
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,770
and wrong it's what's historically cause

385
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,870
people to have to be harmed which groups

386
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,580
have historically been harmed because

387
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,870
they're still being harmed they're still

388
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,330
being hurt how can I stop this am i

389
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,220
complicit within something within a

390
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,110
system or a machine that's cause it's

391
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,270
going to cause more and being able to

392
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,790
stand up to that and also to say I don't

393
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,000
know and I don't think much security

394
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,010
training really involves people saying I

395
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,240
don't know and I think that filters down

396
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,270
to security awareness okay so really

397
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,100
everything to think on that one so I

398
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,540
think that and I'll come back to this in

399
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,640
a second but I think the communication

400
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,620
gap is massive we have people who if you

401
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,150
want to design a security

402
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,010
training or if I you know if I'm working

403
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,730
with schools or consumers or sex workers

404
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,460
or anybody and I mean if you were doing

405
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,710
that or if you do do that I mean where

406
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,300
where are the easy ways where are the

407
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,000
easy places you can get good security

408
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,630
awareness advice for consumers where can

409
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,080
people go to in your organization it's

410
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,490
very difficult but if I want to know you

411
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,100
know he's smoking bad for me what's the

412
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,750
speed limit on this particular type of

413
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,510
road or how does a car engine work I can

414
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,820
go to really really I know there's so

415
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,160
much information out there and I'm

416
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,800
supposed to know this I'm not shamed if

417
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,750
I go to the doc I mean there are bad

418
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,790
garages and bad doctors but you know I'm

419
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,710
expected to go and ask for help if I

420
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,620
don't know but even on security

421
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,380
trainings I noticed there's just you

422
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,940
know I mean I have friends you go on

423
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,040
these massive sounds courses and not

424
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
having a prophet sounds here but I'm

425
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,560
just saying you know they get nearly

426
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,380
their heights in booklets and then they

427
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,820
have to go away after the end of testing

428
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,500
they have to study again to take an exam

429
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,450
and I mean I teach a lot of the time in

430
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,610
schools and I can't do that I can't

431
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,839
teach that because I have to have

432
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,700
measurable outcomes all the time now I

433
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,870
have to say what did they learn at the

434
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,080
end of that hour whereas and and I have

435
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,550
to ask them questions and if they don't

436
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,860
know that's okay I'm supposed to be

437
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,900
saying you will fail which I think Brian

438
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,990
said and rough couple of the talks that

439
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,520
I have said this you know you have to

440
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,950
fail at things to learn and we're not

441
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,390
encouraging people to fail and because

442
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,970
ourselves is in information security is

443
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,740
professional people who understand all

444
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,020
that we're not allowed to fail we're not

445
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,640
allowed to ask questions you're stupid

446
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,839
or whatever else you don't get that kind

447
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,699
of spirit of learning which we need we

448
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,770
desperately need that desperate need

449
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,449
standards as well so the security

450
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,439
customer when at the customer service

451
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,949
side of things I'm really tired of

452
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,309
information security people big accounts

453
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:29,410
you'll know who I'm talking about the

454
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,880
kind of ones who call me apathy on their

455
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,800
personal blogs they they often go for

456
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,630
the experience of problem and even

457
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,580
though the lethea sleety macaca they

458
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,200
still can't seem to find

459
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,279
purity apps or the CISOs email and to

460
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,320
advise them of a problem and they want

461
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,620
to go for these security awareness reps

462
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,990
but I say to people every time when they

463
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,429
say and I've gotten the reference

464
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:55,929
section I've written some stuff on who I

465
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,929
guilt and shame doesn't work and if you

466
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,279
want to read about that you can't I'm

467
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,899
not going to go into it now but I'll say

468
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:03,460
to them well there's no it works shame

469
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,289
works it works if I you know shame the

470
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:08,049
Virgin Media where it works if I you

471
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:10,059
know go for this company you know

472
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:12,700
wherever it was t-mobile a year or so

473
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,289
ago that had the issue every company

474
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:17,110
will have one or has had one it happens

475
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,139
that's security right we learn and the

476
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:21,850
attackers are getting more and more of

477
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,559
us we know that we know it's just a

478
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,720
matter of time or we just haven't

479
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,110
noticed yet and so I say to them if you

480
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,330
think Shane works fine what about the

481
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,010
later but do you know your social media

482
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,899
team you work for this organisation this

483
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:37,389
big tech company do you follow your

484
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:40,539
social media team do you know so would

485
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,010
you even know you know you're posting

486
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,049
all this stuff on this company's website

487
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:45,730
you and I switch your account I mean

488
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,590
information security a lot of people

489
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,669
seem to think the world revolves around

490
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,720
Twitter and it doesn't but do you know

491
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,639
them do you even know who they are have

492
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:55,929
you done the awareness training with

493
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:57,429
them do they get the training or they

494
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,750
just like the team I was working with

495
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,649
three lines end of conversation which

496
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:04,059
doesn't do your company reputation any

497
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,350
good it doesn't do their customer

498
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,899
service team any good either

499
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:09,789
and you follow your organization so if

500
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,950
there was an issue would you know while

501
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,539
you're yelling about how nobody has any

502
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:14,919
response time you can't find the

503
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,789
security at would you even know yourself

504
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,409
if there was something that happened at

505
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,669
your company and who has the admin

506
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,389
passwords for the social media accounts

507
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:30,669
at your company I mean switzer itself

508
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,100
had Jack's account got hacked didn't it

509
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,019
something happened to it we know as

510
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,120
something to do is a sim card I think I

511
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,029
don't know discord had to help them shut

512
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:42,130
that down and think another platform it

513
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,649
took them 30 something 31 minutes to

514
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:47,500
shut their own CEOs account down

515
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,659
closed it down because nobody noticed or

516
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,169
nobody could do anything but you know

517
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:54,490
everybody all scream and shout about

518
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:54,860
some

519
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,340
poor customer service rep who's paid has

520
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,720
no 20,000 15,000 pounds a year and who

521
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,760
has those big screens flashing yeah this

522
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,960
is amount of calls you've got waiting

523
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,640
some at waiting time you've got if you

524
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,080
don't believe me if go down and have a

525
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,570
look at those teams and see the pressure

526
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,120
they're under and then try and talk to

527
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,830
them about breaches and things like that

528
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,990
and blame them and all that kind of

529
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,790
thing it's worth you have to have these

530
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,770
levels of communication because like

531
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,540
when the Apple FaceTime bug got phoned

532
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,309
it I think it got emailed or phoned in

533
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:26,720
originated way into a customer service

534
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,900
kind of silo and they didn't know what

535
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,970
to do with it that's a grapple laughs

536
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,270
well they're actually pretty good washed

537
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,010
up don't say so

538
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,890
so a fella great but they still didn't

539
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,919
have that communication link between

540
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,150
incident response for security and

541
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,340
customer service and so when you have

542
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,419
like you know when you have a like they

543
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,610
still have to press a button maybe on an

544
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,049
email I think this is a phishing I think

545
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,370
it's suspicious again it goes to

546
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,760
somebody in IR or somewhere else yeah at

547
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,290
least somebody has the chance even if

548
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,059
they boot it I mean probably that would

549
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,590
be kicked out anyway because you'll

550
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,510
they'll be automated in your lil check

551
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,190
it but it at least should go somewhere

552
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,660
so they have the chance to kind of catch

553
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,669
that but it didn't it's out there for

554
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:09,919
weeks because nobody even at Apple had

555
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,440
the link between customer service and

556
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,809
any kind of incident response security

557
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,270
team so that's it are you training those

558
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,190
teams are you in empowering those people

559
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,679
okay and so you and they can't ask

560
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,710
because they don't know what to ask for

561
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,120
okay and I think really I think security

562
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,280
awareness should be like CPA we should

563
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,040
get CPA for it people should everybody

564
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,740
should well you know security teams and

565
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,419
also need you know security awareness

566
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:40,040
training as well everybody should but it

567
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,440
should be tailored for those needs that

568
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,080
security awareness person whoever they

569
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,429
are they're in-house other vendors

570
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:47,929
should go to this manage of that team

571
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:49,460
who should have consulted with the team

572
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,690
on their various needs and it should be

573
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,130
personalized it shouldn't just be you

574
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,070
know click through and then do you quiz

575
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,750
lots of ish you know what's a whale

576
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,600
what's how does malware spread is really

577
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,220
it should be something that's certified

578
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,620
that's used by that's created by people

579
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,330
who understand security who are

580
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,309
interested in it and who are motivated

581
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:11,440
you make that individualize

582
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,480
differentiated accessible and all the

583
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,929
rest and it should start with how it all

584
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:19,179
works which is what quite a lot of

585
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,830
people even in security are afraid to

586
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,309
ask I'm sure you're not there are people

587
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,749
who have gaps in their knowledge and I

588
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:27,159
think because it obviously it changes

589
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,129
all the time security changes I mean I'm

590
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,799
constantly learning stuff and I'm not

591
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,240
anywhere near in a MOS like a super

592
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,179
engineering tech role so again we need

593
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:41,830
to be able to understand when we're

594
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,240
doing security awareness and the stuff

595
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,809
that I do very basic level is kind of I

596
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,549
say well these are the CIA principles

597
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:51,369
and this is this is how a network kind

598
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,259
of if I go any further sometimes ago

599
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,940
this is her networking works and I often

600
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,350
have to look all that up you know I

601
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,610
check what's DNS like I think because

602
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,659
these are the kind of terms that you

603
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:03,149
thought I mean this is a deeper level

604
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:06,399
but people want to learn and if you want

605
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,899
to talk about making people interested

606
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:09,460
in even bringing people into security

607
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,899
because oh my goodness we need people

608
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,519
and their skills gap and all the rest of

609
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,289
it but how are we going to get people

610
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:16,450
switched on for this if we just kind of

611
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,669
go well it's a it's a computer don't

612
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:20,080
touch it until you know just cooks I'm

613
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,509
just call me don't touch it you know and

614
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:24,999
I padded or a computer is significantly

615
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,669
less complicated than your body or your

616
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,940
car you know you can force restart it

617
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,470
you can't force well you can't force

618
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,149
restart your heart but you know you need

619
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:37,119
some help right but we think of not

620
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,529
where people are scared the public is

621
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,809
scared of touching tech things because

622
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:41,860
we've made them think that they're

623
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,759
stupid and we go on line and we allow

624
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,259
some of our biggest accounts to you know

625
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:53,049
to basically flame customer service reps

626
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,700
or members of the public you make simple

627
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,549
mistakes even the mistakes that we

628
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:01,840
ourselves would make and it's really

629
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,529
unfair so this is the kind of thing

630
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,309
I've used this in trainings that I've

631
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:11,019
done and this is examine you can pay

632
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:14,019
Julia you can you buy her stuff and she

633
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,639
has she does provide some stuff for free

634
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,710
for students and there's links that you

635
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,909
can use our own honor system but it's

636
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:20,200
worth it something like twelve dollars

637
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,700
for a book and she sells a lot of the

638
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,279
stuff you

639
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,529
got deal with no starch I mean nowhere

640
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,330
affiliate said I just think that I just

641
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,309
it's nice to recognize good work this is

642
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,049
exactly the kind of thing that I think

643
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:34,599
security awareness needs to include and

644
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,769
I think quite a lot of people in

645
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,509
security every time every time I show

646
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:40,369
you people this and they're a lot more

647
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:41,809
technical than me they've got all their

648
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:44,659
OS CP and all the rest hello wow they

649
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,279
say oh wow this is amazing it's really

650
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,859
good I wish I'd had this but it's lovely

651
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:51,379
isn't it beautifully presented then it's

652
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:53,090
nice I mean got you can go and look at

653
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,529
that first she's done so much stuff she

654
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,919
explains all these different things and

655
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:59,089
I just think we need to make things more

656
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:01,339
accessible Google I haven't got the link

657
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:02,719
but me and you don't need it Google do a

658
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,249
Coursera course and I think they offer

659
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,349
it on their own you can google it anyway

660
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:10,129
it's they do a really nice course for

661
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:12,830
aspiring cybersecurity professionals or

662
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,619
and think it's like an IT Help Desk

663
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,879
course as well if you want to prepare

664
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:18,469
yourself is aimed at people you want to

665
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:19,820
prepare themselves for that course by

666
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,979
taking a lot of material from that or I

667
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,979
I send people to it because it's really

668
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:28,779
lovely and explains so much so yeah

669
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:32,629
moving on harm reduction really really

670
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:35,269
matters and it matters in the sense of

671
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,399
because we're not talking to people who

672
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:39,049
work in customer facing roles about

673
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,700
security and privacy and because we

674
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,719
don't design things with that in mind

675
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:49,549
people get hurt I have oh yeah this is

676
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,899
this comes from a app by security first

677
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:56,029
I've got the link at the end of the

678
00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:02,989
presentation and Rory Byrne he's there

679
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:04,129
based I think actually have gotten

680
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,039
office out of Dublin but they've made

681
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,809
this so this is an app it's called the

682
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,729
umbrella app you can go on security

683
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:12,379
first and it'll download it for years in

684
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:13,909
the App Store as well and it's really

685
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:15,289
nice if you want to use that to train

686
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:17,809
people around harm reduction okay when

687
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,369
we're thinking about how because it

688
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,769
looks at their own personal risk first

689
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:22,820
and you go for all these different

690
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,710
things to each of those little folders

691
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,139
and it goes down there's more than that

692
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:30,470
has lessons and things to consider for

693
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,720
you know your security and safety how

694
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,160
you manage it

695
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,840
are you traveling what your risks it's

696
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,590
aimed at journalists and activists but

697
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,890
it is so useful that I've used it in an

698
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,540
area quite a few other people are using

699
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,110
it as well for just general security

700
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,520
awareness because it's so beautifully

701
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,810
done all the materials there and they

702
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,580
don't mind if you use that I mean credit

703
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,750
them but they don't mind they just want

704
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:01,010
it used okay so yeah so so my account

705
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,280
was compromised because anti-fraud

706
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,010
didn't they have these procedures which

707
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,560
are around protecting the business not

708
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,790
particular consumer so I had a credit

709
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,660
card which and I that was part of how I

710
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,200
escaped my ex and I put quite a lot of

711
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
stuff on there and when I within the I

712
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,010
went paperless and I said to them when I

713
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,080
set it up in person I set it up as well

714
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,510
and I said I really want no paper

715
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,820
nothing no trace of this nothing must

716
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,220
have' be seen of my home address about

717
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,790
this card or this account okay fine we I

718
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,160
got one letter about a year before I

719
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,800
left the states I got one letter and I

720
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,720
was straight on the phone absolutely

721
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,580
you've sent me paper I never want

722
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,050
anything else coming I'm closing my

723
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,970
account this is really vital this is

724
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,780
part of my plan to escape and I said

725
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,310
absolutely no ma'am you know we we've

726
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,020
because I said I don't care I don't care

727
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,850
what legal things you've got you you

728
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,630
know that you mustn't send me anything

729
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,130
to my home address it could put me in

730
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,550
really big danger and this account I'm

731
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,440
you know I'm booking flights on it and

732
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,310
other things like that and I managed

733
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,830
that was fine but about three months

734
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,160
after I'd left and I was back in the UK

735
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,450
you can't earn by the way you can't

736
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,870
forward mail from the u.s. to Europe

737
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,250
which I didn't realize but I didn't I

738
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,210
wasn't worried about forwarding mail

739
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,530
anyway because everything was paid for

740
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,700
less and everything was fine and I shut

741
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,980
everything down but they still sent a

742
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,530
piece of paper a letter statement to my

743
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,210
old address which then got forwarded to

744
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,630
my ex and his stalker mates who'd really

745
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,700
enjoyed stalking me all the way through

746
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,080
and made my life absolutely hell

747
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,039
and so they they open the mail which is

748
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:47,999
a federal offense

749
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:49,320
then they took a screen they took a

750
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,519
photo of it which is second federal

751
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,049
offense and sent it to him we're

752
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:54,149
compiler compiling our offenses here and

753
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,379
I could have taken them to court or in

754
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:58,110
them but I just waited to be done and I

755
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,149
phoned my bank and said look this has

756
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:02,309
happened I really want everything shut

757
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:04,200
down I this is the what a few whales

758
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,690
have you said and they said they wanted

759
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,919
to take me through some more security

760
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,869
questions which I could pass for then

761
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:11,549
there was a subsequent security question

762
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,610
which was about the account number as I

763
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,379
passed all the security questions and

764
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,119
I'm flagging up this is my account I've

765
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:20,460
got a stalker I've had to leave you know

766
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,279
in a visa situation and they said we

767
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,989
just need for one more question we need

768
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:26,609
to know the entire account number of the

769
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:28,489
account that you were paying that

770
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:31,369
statement from and I didn't have that

771
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,779
with me because I kind of had to leave

772
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,359
quite quickly and because of that I got

773
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,179
completely logged out and then to phone

774
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,279
customer service as well I then

775
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,200
complains I was almost kind of free

776
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,450
toll-free number and I got they

777
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,590
transferred me when I said I want to

778
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,899
speak to supervise I see white women do

779
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,509
that really well to a manager and and

780
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:53,100
they transferred me to a number in the

781
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,369
USA which then met my mobile number got

782
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:58,320
cut off because I was now on my uk-based

783
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,859
mobile or cooling aus number and then I

784
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:03,989
had two hundred pounds worth of charges

785
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,820
and then like you know my mobile fighter

786
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,249
cut me off can you imagine I mean all of

787
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:09,840
this it kind of assumes that you will

788
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,039
have a fail-safe no they assumed that I

789
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,749
had money that I had somebody who I

790
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:17,850
could stay with you know I'm talking to

791
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,049
them about a credit card and they just

792
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,330
said we are we frozen it so they locked

793
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,090
me out of it then I had certain all of

794
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,529
that then I had to get it shut down so I

795
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,239
want it closed you can't close it

796
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,639
virtually you have to I don't know you

797
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:30,749
can't even go and pet is really

798
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:32,909
difficult really convoluted so they

799
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:33,989
promised me are they to shut that

800
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:36,419
account down and about three weeks ago I

801
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,460
got loads of messages saying hey we've

802
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,899
extended your credit limit on this

803
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:44,669
account still active still live so it's

804
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:45,590
just

805
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,950
everything that we do is a no it's this

806
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,169
assumes that people are living within a

807
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:54,389
the boundaries of what we expect or what

808
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:57,119
we see is normal even there even there

809
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,799
security questions were rubbish if

810
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,509
you're in a situation where you have

811
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:02,549
somebody who has coercive control or who

812
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:04,889
knows you most of the people you live

813
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:06,269
with I'll have access to your documents

814
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:08,399
wherever you keep them could probably

815
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,710
get through the basic security questions

816
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,749
if you've set them up in a normal way if

817
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:14,549
you need your you know social security

818
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:15,629
or national interest number your

819
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:17,369
passport number your mother's maiden

820
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:20,249
name and I've made dogs birthday they

821
00:31:20,249 --> 00:31:22,529
would know all of that and for this

822
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:24,899
particular credit card they were asking

823
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,960
for such really rubbish questions you

824
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,519
know that SSN and stuff a lot of things

825
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,889
that you couldn't lie about it required

826
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:34,049
more than just a ridiculous answer that

827
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,159
only you would remember you know what's

828
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,809
your mother's maiden name Mars or

829
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:39,809
something you couldn't put that in

830
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:42,779
because it required an SSN or national

831
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,179
Sharon's number whatever so it's really

832
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,619
important that we think about this and

833
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,119
because we're not designing around that

834
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,039
because we think everybody lives like us

835
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,779
and press the same risks as are so we

836
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,749
don't have to care

837
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:57,869
so yeah you can't to reduce harm to

838
00:31:57,869 --> 00:32:00,480
understand risk scenarios to understand

839
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,309
security and and work towards privacy

840
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:04,139
and securing things we have to make sure

841
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:08,580
that we are you know respecting that

842
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,499
aware of that starting it from the

843
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:13,169
ground up and that we're also you know

844
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:14,820
like I've said we're not using you know

845
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,350
the real drivers real names or the

846
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,989
customer service reps real names when

847
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:20,759
we're doing things because that affects

848
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,470
their privacy is when it since our big

849
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,320
message even if it's not over if they

850
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,789
really have to think about it and if

851
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:28,259
you're doing really good security

852
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:29,519
awareness right from the base if you

853
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,619
write down what is privacy you know if I

854
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,289
teach the kids I teach a photo a bit of

855
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:35,039
citizenship with them or whatever else

856
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,080
whatever I'm asked to teach I have to

857
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,669
say well what is this what does this

858
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:40,830
mean to you what does voting mean to you

859
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,440
what does you know consent mean to you

860
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,970
and you have to write it down and then

861
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,980
we have a discussion if you say Steve

862
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,690
what does privacy mean to you if you're

863
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,090
saying to this bunch of van drivers for

864
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,549
DPD what does privacy mean to you they

865
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,379
might not have even considered the fact

866
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,570
that their real names are out there and

867
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,100
the harm and the risk

868
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,490
might be there to them or they might

869
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,110
have but you won't know until you ask

870
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,450
and it won't get solved until you ask it

871
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,919
until you start thinking about that and

872
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,330
if you do start thinking about that then

873
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,990
maybe you should stop it and also

874
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,880
marketing I've kind of lost the will to

875
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,789
live a little bit with the amount of

876
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,650
security awareness things that just

877
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,110
people just hire event planners who just

878
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,760
run old because you know they can run a

879
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,950
CTF right because CTF is security

880
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,370
awareness it's not okay and we have to

881
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,919
demand that the people who are training

882
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,090
us who are doing the awareness who are

883
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,620
you know securing the systems that we

884
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,860
all use that they are trained right they

885
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,630
are qualified and they're interested in

886
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,020
security and privacy that that is their

887
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,850
main motivation they're constantly

888
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,679
learning everybody in this room is here

889
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,539
because they want to learn I hope you're

890
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:55,950
learning something in this but alike

891
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,900
we're all here because we're interested

892
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,330
in moving forward and getting new ideas

893
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,620
and talking to each other and the

894
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,940
conversations that you have in the

895
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,750
corridors and things they're so valuable

896
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,909
and I don't see that reflected in the

897
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:11,310
security awareness noise I just don't

898
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,219
I've sat in some incredibly powerful

899
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,389
rooms with people who have paid more

900
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,070
than I will ever be paid in my entire

901
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,260
life and I've had to explain to them

902
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,550
even though they're in a cybersecurity

903
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,790
heart or that you know they've got cyber

904
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,649
in their title I've had to explain to

905
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,869
them what are you big he was

906
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,100
I've had to explain to them how to use

907
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,460
email yeah and I expect to do that in a

908
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,989
public sector role where I am sometimes

909
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,690
but I mean wow if you're the VP of

910
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,340
security or something you should really

911
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,989
know what are you be key is you should

912
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,629
really know what MFA is and I'm afraid a

913
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:47,840
lot of people don't see

914
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,159
nudges and not just the things like this

915
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,469
now the things that make you behave in a

916
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,030
way that is kind of file a new like oh

917
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,080
I'll do that and you don't think about

918
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,060
doing it yeah I would totally run up

919
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,770
those stairs and I'm a lazy fat moose

920
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:08,000
okay so insecurities don't we try I'm

921
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,800
trying to get people away from using

922
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,720
just the red line box because we know we

923
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,030
shout after that you accept the risk yes

924
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,010
do you want to see the risky content

925
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,580
absolutely okay if we make it kind of

926
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,040
fun oh no I don't want to be too fun

927
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,960
because there is a serious side to it

928
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,820
but you know we've had pop-up boxes come

929
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,320
up for people we've had charts on the

930
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,910
wall we've had things where people come

931
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,060
into offices and just in the foot steps

932
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,380
they're taking there's a little thing

933
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,820
that's saying you know are you thinking

934
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,050
about there so you're thinking about the

935
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,400
privacy people are you thinking about

936
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,050
you know why they asking this question

937
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,000
if somebody's ringing up and saying hey

938
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,860
my my wife can't come to the phone

939
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,960
because she's or my husband can't come

940
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,420
to the phone because you know they're

941
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,450
just outside milking the cows and can

942
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,800
you just give me the access to their

943
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,600
account it should be these things of it

944
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,670
is the person there can you speak to

945
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,930
them yeah and other things like that if

946
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,480
the anti-fraud had had better questions

947
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,740
they might have helped me because I was

948
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,720
saying to them I am a victim of abuse I

949
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,690
really need some help you know this is

950
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,510
really important and somewhere somehow

951
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,080
lots of things went wrong so yeah the

952
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,480
Nadi's will remind us of what we want to

953
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,130
do because we forget what we want to do

954
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,620
a healthy me goes to the shop and buys

955
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,450
those of healthy snacks and then hungry

956
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,260
me at eight pm really hates healthy me

957
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,730
but yeah in the end I'm kind of pleased

958
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,470
okay so these are what the nudges are

959
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,930
for yeah it's making sure that we put

960
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,580
things within our systems to our scale

961
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,380
Custer the people who are dealing with

962
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,990
customers or anybody you know if they're

963
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,220
answering the phone if they're dealing

964
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,320
with anything outside or even if they're

965
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,390
not actually you need those people are

966
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,440
going to get calls they're going to get

967
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,460
you know I don't want talk about

968
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,720
phishing and all rest of it but if

969
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,680
they're going to have that kind of

970
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,180
interaction where they might be able to

971
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,100
access something and give somebody data

972
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,620
or information or manipulate accounts or

973
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,630
whatever else they need to have Nadja's

974
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,580
pop up are you sure this is the right

975
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,050
person you're speaking to could they

976
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,220
provide another form of ID

977
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,080
vacation has they done this have you

978
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,990
checked this does this feel right and

979
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,580
they won't know if it feels right unless

980
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,109
we've made him think about security and

981
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:13,040
privacy okay see how the good questions

982
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,170
and the good reflexes and the good light

983
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,119
and the good training do save lives and

984
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,000
they save money because ultimately we're

985
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,349
not just talking about you know people

986
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:23,060
their lives like me you know if I'm a

987
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,640
abuse survivor I got out I'm fine so far

988
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,650
okay but even if I die suppose it

989
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,599
doesn't cost anybody any money but if

990
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,650
you talk to companies about they save

991
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,210
how they can save money how they can

992
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,130
protect themselves but how they're not

993
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,050
because if that DPD driver he'd be great

994
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,520
you could probably fish him or you could

995
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,619
probably you know go after him you know

996
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:45,140
it's not just about harming him it would

997
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,550
be also about you know trying to get

998
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,250
information and there's easy ways to do

999
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,990
it because people don't realize they

1000
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:56,330
really don't all the time yeah thank you
