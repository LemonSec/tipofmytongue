1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,960
much so we've been seeing a lot of scary

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,929
presentations today haven't we you know

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:10,759
lots of lots of Breaking and Entering

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,849
and all that kind of stuff so I thought

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,300
I would you know follow in that vein so

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,130
the the scary thing that I'm gonna

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,110
contribute is that Warren doesn't

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,940
actually know what I'm going to talk

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,070
about he does not know it could be

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,830
anything what do you suppose would scare

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,850
a conference organizer the most let's

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,030
think about this so maybe I could insult

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,460
all the attendees I could do a talk on

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,030
cybersecurity 101 about how exciting you

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,760
know and and dangerous cybersecurity is

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,510
how important it is I don't know I could

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,229
talk about about multi-dimensional

18
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,149
cryptography using music's infinite

19
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,740
variability would you see that anybody

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,100
remember that one so yeah he doesn't

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,960
know what I'm gonna talk about it could

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,920
be just about anything is is he sweating

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,219
yet and I can't tell from over here yeah

24
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,500
yeah you're are you scared all right

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,399
here we go

26
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:25,070
no I actually have a presentation and

27
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,289
and it's kind of a little bit Halloween

28
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,240
themed because it has the word grave in

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,789
it so let's see what we can do here

30
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,770
I miss is going to be very different

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,299
from the other talks that you've seen

32
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,420
today because I'm going to talk about

33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,840
how security affects us when we you know

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
leave the office how it affects us as

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,189
consumers and all the people in our

36
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,049
lives who are also consumers so I'm

37
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,810
gonna start by telling you a few a few

38
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,909
stories so first of all when my oldest

39
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,700
was about three or four before he could

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,729
read we started putting him in front of

41
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,979
a computer and letting him play on kids

42
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:09,348
websites and he would just click around

43
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:11,200
you know happily

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,270
and we came in one day and we found him

45
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,680
in the middle of downloading and

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,420
installing a browser plugin ah how could

47
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,790
this have happened well we kind of

48
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,980
figured out that what what might have

49
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,470
happened is that he had gotten

50
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,750
conditioned by the things that were

51
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,790
showing up on a screen and that he saw

52
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,640
us doing and he even though he couldn't

53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,230
read he got used to the fact that a

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,000
pop-up window would generally have two

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,459
little buttons on it two rectangles and

56
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,709
one of them would be outlined darker

57
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,930
than the other and that would be the

58
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,670
default choice you know do you want to

59
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,790
do this yes or no stop or you know go

60
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,610
whatever and he found out that if he

61
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,230
clicked on the one that was outlined the

62
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,989
darkest it would make the pop-up go away

63
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,700
and he could get back to what he was

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,150
doing so even though he couldn't read he

65
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,849
was being conditioned by this interface

66
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,870
as everybody is as we all are and this

67
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,519
is the sort of thing I might point out

68
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,420
that can be you know exploited that

69
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,370
somebody could leverage against us

70
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,519
because the the you is that we worked

71
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,850
with make us get ready to click on

72
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,510
things if we see the right shapes in the

73
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,150
right order we don't think about them as

74
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,450
much doing so this is a sort of thing

75
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,700
that started affecting my kids at a very

76
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,329
very early age now when he got older

77
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,430
this is an example of you know the other

78
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,139
sorts of things when kids start getting

79
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,560
old enough that their data has to be

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,350
separated from other kids data because

81
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,019
of you know because of regulations

82
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,239
because of student privacy that's when

83
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,880
they start getting assigned logins the

84
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,340
problem though is that a kid who doesn't

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,280
know his letters and numbers and can't

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,670
type really can't log in can they so

87
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,340
again for my oldest I used to volunteer

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,380
at the kindergarten and help the

89
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,510
kindergarten teacher log all the kids in

90
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,359
at the beginning of every class session

91
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,160
this is the sort of thing that is just

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,250
not tenable over the long haul now there

93
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,840
are some companies that are trying to

94
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,070
address this

95
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,750
for example there's one called clever

96
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,090
that has come up with a login scheme

97
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,880
where the kids can wear a QR code on a

98
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,580
on a badge a laminated badge on a

99
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,710
lanyard so that they just show it to the

100
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,190
web camera to login and that takes care

101
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,330
of it for them so we're starting to

102
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,980
address this sort of thing but you know

103
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,460
we have to think about this more in in

104
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,490
that our kids it used to be that you

105
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,990
know computers were something you only

106
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,460
used at work right but now we use this

107
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,470
from cradle to grave even you know

108
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,960
before we are born you know I people are

109
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,760
putting ultrasound pictures on the

110
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,470
internet and things like that our kids

111
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,100
are being exposed to i T you know

112
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,170
practically from birth and all the way

113
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,200
through so you know that they might

114
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,910
start when they are little kids when

115
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,500
you're putting an iPad in front of your

116
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,360
baby and you know letting the play with

117
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,370
something and then as soon as they get

118
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,930
to school they get an account and they

119
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,030
have to start logging in they have to

120
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,020
start using this and then as you go

121
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,390
along how many of you have kids who have

122
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,490
lied about their age to get a social

123
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,510
media account yeah that that is

124
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,000
happening that that is a happening thing

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,220
so you know they're going to be using it

126
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,690
anyway and you know what they are

127
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,260
absorbing from us about how to be secure

128
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,420
online it's kind of hit or miss it

129
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,510
depends on your background so you know

130
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,540
my kids expected that my husband and I

131
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,550
would be of the older generation that

132
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,770
didn't understand technology we were

133
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,170
supposed to be and I said honey who do

134
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,320
you think invented the internet you know

135
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,510
we know a lot about this stuff more than

136
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,420
they do so that was very disappointing

137
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,670
to them but as you go along and you get

138
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,460
into college and you start using social

139
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,700
media and you get a job and you get more

140
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,060
logins and you get more logins and so on

141
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,950
they start adding up

142
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,190
all sorts of things to register your car

143
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,820
you know government accounts and banking

144
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,550
online banking and online shopping and

145
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,630
everything now one of the stupidest

146
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,070
things that we ever did as technologists

147
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,680
is decide that primary credentials

148
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,320
should be stored in the fallible organic

149
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,240
matter that we have right here or as

150
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,920
Chuck Wendy calls it the poetry

151
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,920
generating custard who thought that was

152
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,870
a good idea I mean back when there was

153
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,020
just one computer we could say all right

154
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,910
memorize this don't ever write it down

155
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,180
but now that's ridiculous we should

156
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,130
never have told people that they had to

157
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,790
memorize complex strings that would

158
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,400
number in the dozens or hundreds and

159
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,610
never write them down it you know

160
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,170
statistically speaking from a risk

161
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,030
perspective it is a lot better to write

162
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,920
it down and put it in your wallet

163
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,720
because you know you're gonna protect

164
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,550
your credit cards and everything it's

165
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,340
it's a lot safer to do that than to end

166
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,710
up using the same password over and over

167
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,720
again when it's going to be stolen and

168
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,450
reused so that was on us we made a

169
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,690
mistake there we need to start doing

170
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:49,000
better now as you get older there are

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,660
people you know you become temporarily

172
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,720
incapacitated or you become permanently

173
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,420
incapacitated as you go along there are

174
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,450
people who are disabled who may not be

175
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,570
able to use something online completely

176
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,940
they might need assistance with it the

177
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,190
one big thing that we don't have is a

178
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,200
good system of delegation so I ran into

179
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,290
this problem when my parents started

180
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,010
getting older and they became less

181
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,010
capable of managing their affairs but

182
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,870
they didn't want to admit it they

183
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,490
wouldn't just say fine you take it over

184
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,770
they insisted that they could continue

185
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,799
to do things so think about this for a

186
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,090
minute you know maybe some of you

187
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,530
haven't had to deal with this with your

188
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,590
parents yet but if you yourself were hit

189
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,010
by a bus tomorrow you have all of your

190
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,390
life being managed

191
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,880
online how would you let somebody else

192
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,210
do that for you especially if you're

193
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,660
using two-factor authentication how

194
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,430
would somebody else do this for you do

195
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,080
do you have to tell them all of your

196
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,590
passwords do you switch the 2fa over to

197
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,990
their phone do you give them you know

198
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,930
the the hard tokens what if they are

199
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,780
hundreds of miles away or thousands of

200
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,450
miles away how does that work the

201
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,490
delegation is a big problem

202
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,620
so my to go back to my oldest kid again

203
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,890
when he turned 13 I was informed by our

204
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,010
pharmacy benefits provider that now that

205
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,810
he was 13 he had to set up his own

206
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,820
account and he had to give me permission

207
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,710
to manage his prescriptions and so I

208
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,650
said oh he needs his own account okay

209
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,670
and I set up an account for him you know

210
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,260
with a separate email address because I

211
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,970
figured they might check but all of the

212
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,030
authentication demographic information

213
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,860
that they asked for to make sure it's

214
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,000
really you I knew date of birth I was

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,440
there so I set it all up I logged in i

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,990
authorized myself there we go went went

217
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,840
right back to it so you know that this

218
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,700
is the sort of thing that has not been

219
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,740
very well designed yet and we need to

220
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,920
work on that when my parents got older

221
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,640
when my father had a stroke I had to

222
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,860
break into his computer and break into

223
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,380
his email accounts so that I could reset

224
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,060
the banking password so that I could

225
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,060
continue to pay the bills for my parents

226
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,910
so technically speaking I probably

227
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,950
violated the u.s. Computer Fraud and

228
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,250
Abuse Act but if you've ever tried to

229
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,100
get access to something not not after

230
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,810
they're dead that's a little bit easier

231
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,270
and it's not as much of a rush but while

232
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,250
they are still alive but they're not

233
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,040
capable of giving you what you need in

234
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,530
order to to get access it's a good thing

235
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,800
my father didn't believe in security

236
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,380
because I was able to log in and you

237
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,750
know Brett he had cashed his passwords

238
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,100
than I was able to get in and all

239
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,930
kind of stuff but if you think about

240
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,180
this you know what are we going to do

241
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,470
about this in the future I ran into

242
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,260
another problem when I took over my

243
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,540
parent's gmail accounts again so that I

244
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,150
could manage all of their shopping and

245
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:18,520
their affairs for them and I set up an

246
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,860
alternate email address because there's

247
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,400
a function for that I put my home

248
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,560
address you know which is Wendy at nee

249
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,400
through comm into into the alternate

250
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,890
address field for each of these Gmail

251
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,870
accounts and I figured it was you know

252
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,180
so that if I needed to reset something I

253
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,310
could get the reset email sent to my

254
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,620
account but it turns out that's not

255
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,900
really what that alternate email address

256
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,590
is for Google wants to associate you

257
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,540
with that email address so that you can

258
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,570
send email from either one so it

259
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,210
identifies you with both addresses and

260
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,630
as a result anybody who used Gmail who

261
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,850
tried to email me at Wendy at Nathan

262
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,410
comm and again that's not a gmail

263
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,620
address yes I ran my own email server

264
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,240
don't tell anybody I'm not running for

265
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,170
president so it's alright any time they

266
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,090
would try to email me at Wendy at Nathan

267
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,540
comm Gmail would say oh you mean

268
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,290
Wendy's mother or oh you mean Wendy's

269
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,540
father so I would get an email say you

270
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,420
know and as part of my board of director

271
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,180
duties for another organization and it

272
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,010
would have my email address but it would

273
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,650
have my mother's name as the the full

274
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,510
name on it now that's pretty creepy

275
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,770
especially after my parents passed away

276
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,950
and random strangers would be emailing

277
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,870
me and they would have my parents name

278
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,880
on it there was somebody who was trying

279
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,300
to contact me about about some breach

280
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,550
disclosure issues and he didn't have my

281
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,260
address although he didn't realize it

282
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,870
he started typing my name into Gmail on

283
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,230
his phone and Gmail said oh you mean

284
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,110
Wendy at Nathan calm and handle he

285
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,090
filled it in for him and when it got to

286
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,580
me it would the name it that had

287
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,680
attached was my parents private nickname

288
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,040
for me

289
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,060
now that's just that just gets you that

290
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,200
really gets you so you know I I realized

291
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,060
what was going on and I tried to delete

292
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,279
my email you know from the alternate

293
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,900
address and I contacted Google and I

294
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,760
said this is a problem and they said no

295
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,339
it's working as designed and I said well

296
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,800
you didn't explain fully what this was

297
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,320
for and what was going to happen if I

298
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,779
used it and this is the other thing that

299
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,790
we need to be able to do I mean I've

300
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,380
been an IT for years a really long time

301
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,930
and if I couldn't figure it out that it

302
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,330
was intuitive you know what was going to

303
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,430
happen when I did this there are lots of

304
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,940
people who can't do this it used to be

305
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,360
that you know 30 years ago when we were

306
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,339
writing this stuff it was a very small

307
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,960
community and we all had pretty much the

308
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,790
same level of knowledge the same

309
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,640
background so we could say oh that's

310
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,860
intuitively obvious or we could say RTFM

311
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,330
because everyone was assumed to have the

312
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,890
same level of knowledge that's not the

313
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,550
case anymore we write for the world we

314
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,560
write for our friends for our neighbors

315
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,170
for our teachers for everything for

316
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:29,500
people in countries we've never seen wow

317
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,180
this is the sort of thing that we have

318
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,930
to think about now and we can't say

319
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,670
these things are intuitively obvious we

320
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,589
need a way to explain to people in plain

321
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,890
language if you do this in our interface

322
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,839
this is what's going to happen here are

323
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,180
the you know ramifications down the line

324
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,610
are you sure you want to do this and we

325
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,620
need to do this for it with delegation I

326
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,870
got I was able to set myself up as an

327
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,110
alternate for my mother's banking

328
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,089
account so that I could have my own

329
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,140
account so I could do that online but in

330
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,000
order to revoke it I had to send a paper

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,450
letter what that doesn't make any sense

332
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,270
so again that there is nothing that is

333
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,459
consistent across the board that you

334
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,770
know everybody can figure out what to

335
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,240
use and how to use this so as this goes

336
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,950
along and we go through

337
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,160
to our lives we have to think about how

338
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,540
are you going to delegate it and under

339
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,720
what circumstances in at least in the

340
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,790
United States especially in Texas there

341
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,350
is something called a durable power of

342
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,320
attorney and you can sign it and give

343
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,780
somebody else legal access to your

344
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,940
manager affairs and there are two ways

345
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,460
that it can take effect one of them is

346
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,450
upon immediate effect as soon as they

347
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,850
sign it you are you know good to go

348
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,780
the other one is upon incapacitation so

349
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,300
that means if you want to get the that

350
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,730
power you have to go and declare that

351
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,720
person incapacitated legally which can

352
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,850
take months and it will ruin whatever

353
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,330
relationship you had with them so it's

354
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,070
much better and it was much better for

355
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,100
me to be able to have it take immediate

356
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,840
effect and just be able to say my mom

357
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,940
you know you look tired do you want me

358
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,260
to just log in and take care of this

359
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,300
thing for you and she say oh yes thank

360
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,940
you and so I just did this more and more

361
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,180
and more until she stopped asking and

362
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,220
you know and then she passed away but I

363
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,910
was able to do that so what do we really

364
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,380
need here we need something that goes

365
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,010
across all of our accounts all of our

366
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,730
interactions with IT as consumers from

367
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,590
birth to death and you know we don't

368
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,180
have that today this is something that I

369
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,330
want to challenge everybody to work on a

370
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,730
secure intermediary that covers our

371
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,050
digital lifespan again it shouldn't have

372
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,459
anything to do with your job because

373
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,369
people move jobs it should be something

374
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,109
you can take with you all the time it

375
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,770
should be usable no matter how old you

376
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,500
are and we're starting to see the

377
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,089
beginnings of these we're starting to

378
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,869
see password managers which are the

379
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,030
start of a programmatic interface that

380
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,910
shields users from the malignant growth

381
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,930
of passwords you know we're it used for

382
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,240
your passwords you go to a website it

383
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,460
puts in your password for you this is a

384
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,620
later you know in a few years we're

385
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,120
gonna look back on this and say oh this

386
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,670
is a really crude start but you know we

387
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,160
have it it's good it's starting we're

388
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,020
starting to do more things like web

389
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,060
often and and and an emerging root of

390
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,640
trust which is guess what the cell phone

391
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,680
so the idea of web often is that you

392
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,110
authenticate to the device and then it

393
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,270
does the rest of the authentication for

394
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,970
you so that again it shields you from

395
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,040
having to do all of this and the reason

396
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,050
why we can do it now and we couldn't do

397
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,930
before is now you know we have secured

398
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,540
storage modules on the phones that will

399
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,090
allow us to perform secure cryptographic

400
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,370
functions that we need for

401
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,190
authentication so we're getting there

402
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,410
there's just there is a big problem with

403
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:30,950
this as a root of trust though oops did

404
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,590
everybody just cringe hearing that are

405
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,970
people getting scared

406
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,100
pick it up pick it up oh my god don't

407
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,310
step on it this is the scary part for

408
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:45,310
you it's a very expensive and fragile

409
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,320
root of trust not everybody in the world

410
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,140
has this and even if they have one they

411
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,650
may be sharing it so it is not what we

412
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,770
need that will cover our entire lifespan

413
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,060
you know you're not giving one of these

414
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,350
to your kid I hope I certainly didn't

415
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,790
and we and and we went through a couple

416
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,300
of dead soldiers over and over again

417
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,880
before they they stopped doing that as

418
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,550
kids with their own phones so we do have

419
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,240
to work on this this is where I want

420
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,520
everybody to start thinking about how we

421
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,070
could build something like that and it's

422
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,980
got to be more than just authentication

423
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,660
it's got to help you with security

424
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,150
decisions like do you want to delegate

425
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,820
access to somebody else and if so for

426
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,280
what reasons because password managers

427
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,800
are going to get you into trouble yes

428
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,080
password managers today will let you

429
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,750
share your passwords with a loved one

430
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,420
you can login as them but that means you

431
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,490
run up against the fraud detection

432
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,490
measures of that website especially in

433
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,010
banking because their whole purpose is

434
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,480
to try to figure out if you're not the

435
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,220
right person logging in with those

436
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,220
credentials so that's not going to work

437
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,740
logging in as your loved one you need

438
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,370
delegation that's got to be audited

439
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,930
officially you know Granta bowl

440
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,200
revocable revocable how do you say it

441
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,330
here revocable revocable whatever you

442
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,510
got to be able to take it away and it's

443
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,520
it's got to be something that you can do

444
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,700
with everything that you have it's got

445
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,520
to help you with privacy management

446
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,610
because nobody's gonna read the EULA

447
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,010
that what happened with my kid you know

448
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,100
who was you know getting stuck with the

449
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,590
browser plugin is he finally got to the

450
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,290
EULA and there wasn't a default outlined

451
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,990
box for him to click on you know it was

452
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,700
like agree and disagree or something

453
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,500
like that he couldn't read and he didn't

454
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,060
know what to click on so that's where he

455
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,100
was sitting when we found him and that's

456
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,970
where he got stuck so you know nobody's

457
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,190
gonna read you as you need things

458
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,870
presented to you in a way that you're

459
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,790
going to understand so that you can make

460
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,950
those decisions a lot of the privacy

461
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,780
decisions that we offer today through

462
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,080
user interfaces assume that you the

463
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,300
person in front of the screen are the

464
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,250
owner of the data and you're making

465
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,860
those decisions but again in the schools

466
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,870
a lot of times you know for kids who are

467
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,820
minors it's either the parents or the

468
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,530
teachers who are making those privacy

469
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,470
decisions so again we need you know

470
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,070
something that's age-appropriate to help

471
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,080
the right decisions be made by the right

472
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,630
people and then again we need delegation

473
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,450
so we need something that is going to be

474
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,900
more than identity because there we

475
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,850
never have just one identity we all wear

476
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,030
different hats throughout all of the

477
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,180
accesses that we have it's got to be

478
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,560
something that encompasses and conforms

479
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,680
with regulations across the globe which

480
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,549
is going to take

481
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,960
really long time it's got to be provided

482
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,480
by an entity that everybody trusts now

483
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,580
good luck with that

484
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,610
that's going to be very very difficult

485
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,009
to do it's probably going to have to be

486
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:12,950
an entity that has no other skin in the

487
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,440
game that does not have any agenda other

488
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,559
than providing this sort of service so

489
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,879
that they'll be trusted they can't be

490
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:23,019
selling the data they can't be you know

491
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:25,369
promoting anything else they've got to

492
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:29,359
be able to do that and it's got to work

493
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,970
at the speed of bits and bytes not at

494
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,330
the speed of legal documents that's the

495
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,129
other really big thing you can't wait

496
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:41,799
for weeks for something to happen so

497
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,590
that's the challenge

498
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,570
what if somebody here in this room is

499
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,570
going to be the one who starts this

500
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:58,220
maybe it's you but we're waiting we're

501
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,559
waiting go ahead and do it it's maybe

502
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,499
it's you it's got to be somebody and you

503
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:05,470
know as Brian was saying this morning

504
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,580
we've got to fix some of these security

505
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,889
things and at my age I thought he was

506
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,080
gonna say this but I'll say it we better

507
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,179
hurry and fix it because at my age I

508
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,840
can't wait around much longer so it's

509
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,409
it's got to be you folks and you know

510
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:22,879
this may be one of the greatest

511
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:27,200
challenges of our generation hydrogen at

512
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,440
our collective generation this may be

513
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,779
the biggest challenge for us so if you

514
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:36,529
want a really big challenge let's do

515
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:41,869
this but first let's have a drink thank

516
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:43,700
you

517
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,760
you
