1
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,670
thanks very much for coming along today

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,759
I'm about 40 minutes or so around the

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,280
state of cybersecurity report that info

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,700
security and more specific at the start

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,210
of this year and extent leap layer this

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,410
is a slightly longer version of the talk

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,420
I did originate in post security Europe

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,570
and especially I've done this outside of

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,669
mainland England actually I'm thinking

10
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:30,519
it's so and yes big things to all of you

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,149
becoming and appreciate that so just a

12
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,520
little a bit about me I'm depth here

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,960
this room info security magazine been

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,059
there almost four years format analyst

15
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:42,280
with four five one research but with

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,750
somebody's not paying attention actually

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,579
is that hey there we go

18
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,800
three four five one a couple of things

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,690
and I don't care I'm put it on the

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,340
bottom now to time b-side speaker this

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,620
but second time I was at Scotland in

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,070
about 2017 I think it was so okay I'll

23
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,350
be a little bit uh a little bit proud of

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,570
myself right just a tiny little bit just

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,460
probably knocked Italy visible from the

26
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,379
back and again just like a man said you

27
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,240
can barely see it here a little bit min

28
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,320
for a security magazine if you're not

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,150
familiar with it on Twitter at info

30
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,430
security mag we write quite a lot

31
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,340
content for light IT security leaders

32
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,110
people who kind of do a lot of like the

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,729
buying the hiring the purchasing the

34
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:21,460
strategies we do some tech stuff and

35
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,549
trying it right we do print issues I

36
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,960
don't have any with me we literally go

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,579
to press next week on the next print

38
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,890
issue so if you don't get that drop me a

39
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,689
message on some contact details up at

40
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:32,140
the end

41
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,100
that's the corporate thing right and I

42
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,439
think I might have actually left in this

43
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,640
one as well this is just a bit of

44
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,110
information about what info security

45
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,030
magazine to and I'm gonna whiz through

46
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,680
it we actually the podcast now we do

47
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,740
weekly webinars and we do a lot of we do

48
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,659
online summits so we do a lot of content

49
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,700
I call it high quality until I didn't

50
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
put that slide in a high quality

51
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,750
editorial content and that sort of thing

52
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,799
right so what is this gonna run through

53
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,530
what the state of size of your report is

54
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,479
going to talk about what's driving cyber

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,210
security now a little bit comparison to

56
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,070
other things it's a little bit of future

57
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,860
stuff and think I've been working on

58
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,360
which is very kind of ongoing piece of

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,420
research it's about

60
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,040
how the trends affect people coming into

61
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,930
the industry now and then we'll just

62
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,160
wrap up at the end so it should be done

63
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,959
on time which I'm sure the organizers

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,680
will be appreciative of so 2018 last

65
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,560
year I did the first slice I try and get

66
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,630
its states of cybersecurity report we

67
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,230
report from now on the idea was we see a

68
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,060
lot of threat reports and then here is

69
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,270
worked in media and lists a lot of you

70
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,130
actually I mean Brian was citing the

71
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,420
Verizon report which is one of the best

72
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,730
ones out there there's a lots and lots

73
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,319
and lots of reports out there so we're

74
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,370
looking to the case of like you know

75
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,160
there's more let's create one ourselves

76
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,750
we thought let's do one that we actually

77
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,250
write ourselves we do the research

78
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,019
ourselves and we try and talk to people

79
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,480
and try and drop the trends triage what

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
they've been saying so come with the

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
common trends did that last year got to

82
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,310
32 people a lot of reports you read will

83
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,810
be written by people at polymer and one

84
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,760
poll various different research

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,220
organizations not many have actually got

86
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,140
a guy like me getting on the phone to

87
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,030
various sort of security leaders see so

88
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,459
CEOs etc and actually going out and

89
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,590
saying what's what we do so what I did

90
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,940
was a good 33 people it's like a little

91
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,500
bit late in the year to be honest and

92
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,269
got this out in time for InfoSec last

93
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,459
year and these were the top findings so

94
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:28,250
gdpr was number one 46 percent of

95
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,320
respondents consider the fact this was

96
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,060
done research for no map March April

97
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,090
2018 ripe in the run-up to GDP are so

98
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,920
hence that was top threat landscape

99
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,900
coming over 12 months on from wanna cry

100
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,690
not texture and then board level clouds

101
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,610
and persistent and then just like Brian

102
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,350
swing map thud and panic actually which

103
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,239
is quite an interesting one to see come

104
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,299
in as a top trend we liked it it was

105
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,769
right now really well people seem to

106
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:52,820
like it so we thought let's do it again

107
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,680
which is quite simply what I'm

108
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,079
presenting today so version 2 came out

109
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,230
into a 19 as again we started quite

110
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,250
early it could we knew what we were

111
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,510
doing and also it's quite easy to go to

112
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,220
people and say I want to do what we did

113
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,190
last year but a little bit different or

114
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,970
a little bit you know a little bit

115
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,100
larger so again came out in time for

116
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,519
InfoSec I got 60 people across the

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,510
industry and just because I yeah it was

118
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,380
a little bit easier to come together

119
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,269
started about February ran through club

120
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,470
at Sauber mid-april

121
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,950
and from those conversations

122
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,790
31 distinct friends

123
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,500
imagine most of you if I said to you can

124
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,820
you know me 31 friends with in

125
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,100
cybersecurity you probably last six I

126
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,350
sabe your head so 31 was quite

127
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,220
impressive

128
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,950
these include five top trends so five

129
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,660
most common trends is sort with twenty

130
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,000
eighteen five lower trends like sort six

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,250
to ten and then eight single response

132
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,690
trends I put those in because I think

133
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,010
it's quite interesting that's only been

134
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,880
cited by one particular person and a

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,100
previous time I actually I think

136
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,570
actually was that InfoSec someone said

137
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,210
what sort of people did we survey so

138
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,560
these are the kind of people we were

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,630
talking to so you can see it's a lot of

140
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,210
company people which is the probably

141
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,800
easiest to get access to actually it's

142
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,060
kind of the vendor CEOs the CTOs the

143
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,640
evangelists and that sort of thing as

144
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,420
well as the C so other words I see so

145
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,190
sore their various practitioner side of

146
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,080
things as well that sort of thing so

147
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,930
that's kind of people we were talking to

148
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,080
so it's was actually asked me after my

149
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,430
presented this was about two weeks ago

150
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,960
and so what survey what sectors were

151
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,070
surveyed and someone said how many

152
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,170
verses are private versus public sector

153
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,270
yeah I'll put my hands up now on from

154
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,220
the public sector review every 150 of

155
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,890
the sixty were from the private sector

156
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,200
VC legal association to analyst and four

157
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,910
from education that you know professors

158
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,100
and that sort of thing so if we do this

159
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,110
again next year I might try and sort of

160
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,250
reach out try and balance it out a

161
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,700
little bit more okay let's move on then

162
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,980
so from the sixty people we interviewed

163
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,980
house survey said the top trend then was

164
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,320
product problems and sort of technology

165
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,170
troubles and this was a kind of a

166
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,080
combination of several factors which you

167
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,510
can read here the as you can see their

168
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,370
companies stuck in the cycle of constant

169
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,760
crisis too many problems with detection

170
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,870
that's also vulnerability management

171
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,150
legacy technology someone who'd actually

172
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,440
say to me what do you mean by legacy

173
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,040
technology a previous presentation it's

174
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,360
a tricky one to determine actually

175
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,980
legacy because to some people I would

176
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,600
say something might say that something

177
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,190
came out in like say 2010 like the

178
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,720
original palo alto network firewall

179
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,220
might say well that's now legacy and i'm

180
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,990
like we're actually pretty nothing wrong

181
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,950
with that and actually it's pretty

182
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,210
nothin wrong the original checkpoint

183
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,010
firewall if you're still using that and

184
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,270
you're configuring it and you're making

185
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,220
it work to the the neat level that you

186
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,130
need to work it

187
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,840
commoditization fishing obviously the

188
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,580
top one there more technology and there

189
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,830
are problems I just picked out a few

190
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,140
comments from the report so as you can

191
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,390
see the 16 attack vectors there are 26

192
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,680
technology sectors this actually did

193
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,540
come from the CEO a CEO in this case it

194
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,910
was a kill swept and check point so he

195
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,140
actually stood on stage at his own

196
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,130
conference and said that they're

197
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,600
actually we've got too many technologies

198
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,760
for too many for too few attack problems

199
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,190
so interesting that yeah it's a CEOs

200
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,160
determining that problem the big-ticket

201
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,340
solutions haven't delivered and we're

202
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,900
trying to slightly cuz he coming in slow

203
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,140
slowly and I said old technology legacy

204
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,610
and that sort of thing there's a

205
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,620
determination was sitting on this old

206
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,180
technology problem there's some stuff

207
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,980
that Java did when he was at for fight

208
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,840
one about shelfware which is probably

209
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,220
worth looking up at gee if he can find

210
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,740
that about how old stuff is as

211
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,060
technologies bought but just not

212
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,830
utilized and just often too often it's

213
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,150
too hard to configure and we don't

214
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,660
really use it right I think that's the

215
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,050
last one yes so number two a very broad

216
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,960
very hard to determine topic is the

217
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,300
human factor 31 percent of our

218
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,220
respondents there's I'm not huge numbers

219
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,870
it's very split across the sort of the

220
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,280
margin really no ones like you know

221
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,470
seventy percent of people said this but

222
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,850
I said last year was 48 percent

223
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,900
compliance but human factor awareness so

224
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,420
it was very spell that very what broad

225
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,870
umbrella a lot of things here awareness

226
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,820
breaches technology cannot be in

227
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,030
confused customer centric usability

228
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,770
skills shortage that's still going on

229
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,940
will be there for the rest of time

230
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,890
talking about that and the concept of

231
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,840
upskilling people is actually quite an

232
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,860
interesting one that that would come

233
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,930
from a someone working for a vendor who

234
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,300
actually said that we're not it's no the

235
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,620
capability to get someone in and then

236
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,270
push them up like Martin link was

237
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,260
talking about this morning actually a

238
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,640
finding people are actually working

239
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,830
training them up is a real problem

240
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,450
actually and we've had this conversation

241
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,030
about week is versus strongest link for

242
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,470
some time so just a few a few points

243
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,820
here yet we still have people the

244
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,950
weakest link a few attempts made to

245
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,020
support them I'm sure we've all heard

246
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,350
that over the years taught and deficit

247
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,730
we're creating this ourselves there's a

248
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,010
feeling actually we are creating

249
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,020
our own skill shortage here by actually

250
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,900
not being able to hire people who fit it

251
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,950
now probably in this audience here it's

252
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,880
putting people trying to look for the

253
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,710
jobs and people are sort of finding you

254
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,960
know you go up there and you find

255
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,710
they're looking for things that you

256
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,450
haven't got and actually then you've got

257
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,800
skills that they need but it's trying to

258
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
meet in the middle between so of an HR

259
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,130
person who's acting like a buffer which

260
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,850
is a bit of a shame and this one is

261
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,520
quite a long quote but social

262
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,230
engineering talk to a couple of social

263
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,150
engineers like Richard de Vere and Jenny

264
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,920
Radcliffe for this as well and obviously

265
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,980
they did cite that so there's too much

266
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,810
of an expectation in the hiring process

267
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,630
for people to be ready and if something

268
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,950
I think industry needs to consider that

269
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,460
certainly came out in the research right

270
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,020
your Ella or moved to number three and

271
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,540
in compliance this was an interesting

272
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,250
one actually because this when I started

273
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,570
doing the research this wasn't coming up

274
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,390
at all and I thought I'm onto a headline

275
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,100
here and that compliance was big one

276
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,390
year and it was out of the top five the

277
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,220
next sadly it started getting cited I

278
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,140
deliberately tried to avoid people like

279
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,550
compliance state protection specialist

280
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,720
because they would have all said this so

281
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,780
I tried to get much broader but

282
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,610
compliance including things like GDP are

283
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,150
obviously PSD to some of you might know

284
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,210
PCI and probably most of you know CCP a

285
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,830
mine I've come across it yeah that's the

286
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,390
new California one which comes out in

287
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,420
January but yeah some of the kind of

288
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,780
common things there frameworks number

289
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,250
two their disappointment over lack of

290
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,230
fines as you can see by the time here

291
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,510
this research there was a feeling that

292
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,600
gdpr wasn't really delivering and hey-ho

293
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,130
this about a month after this published

294
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,620
reports published we saw two fines

295
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,600
coming out so yeah that was the feeling

296
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,580
at first the gdpr we had this build up

297
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,590
and yeah you know the media were doing a

298
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,330
lot and lots of hype about gdpr

299
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,610
and how bad everything was gonna be but

300
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,890
as it worked out it's actually kind of

301
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,990
come true to an extent there were two

302
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,090
fines or intent to fines issued against

303
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,220
ba and Mary it within them about a week

304
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,660
of each other I think as I recall in

305
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,940
July we're now nearly in no but

306
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,290
practically in November from tomorrow

307
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,870
and we've absolutely that's the last

308
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,700
we've heard so who knows maybe that

309
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,110
feeling is still there that hasn't

310
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,450
really delivered just a few comments

311
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,880
then and excitement about regulation has

312
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,270
died down at all its force better

313
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:06,860
incident

314
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,840
phonce those of you do IR stuff maybe

315
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,310
it's actually now you're now seeing more

316
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,780
value of what you're actually doing and

317
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,980
again we've kind of just covered that as

318
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,030
in which world expected right number

319
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,850
four was company and board engagement I

320
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,620
get only 18 percent of people actually

321
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,140
cited this but it was it was enough to

322
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,060
actually get us into our top five and

323
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,530
it's an interesting area because again

324
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,420
it was going to came up last year in

325
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,920
terms of board level recognition now

326
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,740
it's about engagement again Brian said

327
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,300
this this morning about now the fact we

328
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,520
have people actually are taking notes of

329
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,730
us if anyone's watched Jeff Moss opening

330
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,500
at issues black cat USA don't the

331
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,120
keynotes pretty good but he's opening is

332
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,500
really good he says something on the

333
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,650
lines of government regulators legal

334
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,080
boards now recognized cyber and how do

335
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,240
we do something with it so that's worth

336
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,860
checking out in about ten minutes it's

337
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,440
really worth watching but yeah it does

338
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,900
drop it was actually last year it was

339
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,840
third now it's fourth but the fact is is

340
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,160
I'm going to pick up some of the points

341
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,810
here talk about business people in an

342
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,270
immature market discussion between the

343
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,540
CEO and board is different because maybe

344
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,490
the CEO kind of gets it now they might

345
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,010
not understand absolutely everything

346
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,160
pulled awareness measuring culture we

347
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,010
obviously saw no no before bought a CL

348
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,130
tre Cairo it's company they think the

349
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,350
amount was disclosed but you know it

350
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,840
does give a figure to that number

351
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,340
actually to that value of actually

352
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,520
measuring a company's culture and just

353
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,160
to pick a few comments out not the job

354
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,560
of the company to make it more secure

355
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,150
help it to sell stuff and help them meet

356
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,290
their vision board rumors lessons a lot

357
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,520
learns etc and he's taking more

358
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,230
seriously than it was in the past so

359
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,580
these all these comments by the way

360
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,020
these are actually from actual the

361
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,550
research we did these are all actually

362
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,720
quoted in the report which are whilst

363
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll show you a link at the end and then

364
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,650
fifth and the saw the last of the top

365
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,180
five was automation there we can roll

366
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,740
their eyes now if you want because yes

367
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,840
it's still there a I machine learning

368
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,110
under that umbrella of automation and

369
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,300
it's it does have mixed responses which

370
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,360
we'll get onto but yeah the concepts

371
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,310
were that if you are going to do this

372
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,540
you need to put like your whole

373
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,760
or into this really which probably most

374
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,240
people can't really do well I'm sure the

375
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
comments in the second but one see so I

376
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,350
did talk to he was kind of building

377
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,880
almost a grassroots security team he's

378
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,790
from the major publisher and he was able

379
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,920
to actually use machine learning and AI

380
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,930
because he's actually and DevOps because

381
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,300
he's actually starting out so a lot of

382
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,150
more set more established so huge teams

383
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,340
probably aren't ready to work this yet

384
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,750
because it just involves so much

385
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,750
retrofitting as you see too much fun on

386
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,490
AI and machine learning in an immature

387
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,060
markets and that sort of thing so again

388
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,840
a few comments from here so anyone here

389
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,760
doesn't understand non symbolic verses

390
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,040
symbolic I can point you to a medium

391
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,440
blog by Rhett D'Souza because I had to

392
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,810
look at that up as well and this came in

393
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,150
I've very briefly said non symbolic is

394
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,670
what we call good old-fashioned AI makes

395
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,440
use of strings that represent real world

396
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,560
entities or concepts non symbolic

397
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,610
involves provide providing raw

398
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,140
environmental dates to the Machine and

399
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,820
leaving it to recognize patterns so

400
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,890
that's yeah definitely recommend that

401
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,260
reading ret D'Souza's meeting blog then

402
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,600
listening me trying to explain it non

403
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,100
symbolic symbolic then and next one yeah

404
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,040
a lot of height said Fudd around AI even

405
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,750
though he did come in as a very popular

406
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,040
topic is because it was actually quite

407
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,420
mixed it wasn't everyone saying it's

408
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,070
great there was people saying it was a

409
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,080
trend and something we're seeing as a

410
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,300
trend but you gotta try and figure that

411
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,240
one out whether it's good or bad and

412
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,860
that's I think there's a chief for

413
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,020
comments on this yeah it must be old I

414
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,460
think this what she was from that see so

415
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,050
I mentioned an automation first humans

416
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,150
second actually going to do this throw

417
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,710
it all in which I don't think anyone is

418
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,270
so probably saying oh yeah let's do that

419
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,630
and I think there is one more yes it's

420
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,480
there it offers immense value and fear

421
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,150
does sum up probably the entire actual

422
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,130
response is that everyone's like that on

423
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,470
the on the the fence around automation

424
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,590
generally so and there you go again

425
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,900
right so those were the five trends that

426
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,430
we that we discovered in our research I

427
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,440
guess what I probably go I put my hand

428
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,430
up is that yeah this wasn't a pretty

429
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,980
fair example of one year versus the

430
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,150
other because it was different people

431
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,640
there was a larger sample set this

432
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,800
year I'd so you know that the various

433
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,410
sectors we covered a lot of people there

434
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,790
were probably large companies but

435
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,710
hopefully what trying to is capture a

436
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,120
bit more information about what the

437
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,900
industry is actually thinking and just a

438
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,820
little bit so yeah so just to sort of

439
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,070
put the numbers on here but 35 percent

440
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,680
product problems 31 human factor 25

441
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,140
compliance and then I think was 18 for

442
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,230
company engagement any automation so

443
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,990
which compared to state 2018 which is

444
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,000
much more of a compliance and a board

445
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,430
level slightly more technical maybe but

446
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,930
still business strategy stuff isn't

447
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,790
there's no like you know malware stuff

448
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,870
in there and things like that is that

449
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,690
it's a quite a mixed bag of responses

450
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,640
that do suggest that the CSO is still

451
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,080
very much in the security pom it's all

452
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,790
very much business in twine and business

453
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,950
engaged rather than let's get down and

454
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,560
hack all the things kind of thing right

455
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,660
I'm speaking of which let's go to the

456
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,580
six lower trends then so five lower

457
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,650
trends so say sort of six to tens I

458
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,060
thought all these five up on one slide

459
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,670
make it a lot bit easier so cyber

460
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,010
hygiene this is a term that divides

461
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,310
quite a lot of people because to quote

462
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,020
ed Tucker who was one of the people I am

463
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,720
I interviewed for this it came up with a

464
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,460
line one of our webinars which is if the

465
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,140
base was so easy we'd all be doing them

466
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,760
well yeah you probably would actually a

467
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,250
home patch management you know sounds

468
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,820
easy

469
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,290
the vulnerability to slow down that

470
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,140
management and and detection and fixing

471
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,080
it sounds easy and pass what my

472
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,640
everything sounds a lot easier than it

473
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,920
practically is I guess but that's like

474
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,270
the hygiene is something that's kind of

475
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,770
go on you around actually in doing the

476
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,349
basics whatever

477
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,390
cloud so yeah it kind of came up last

478
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,069
year come in a slightly lower this year

479
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,349
hasn't gone away cloud it will still be

480
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,959
a popular topic I think for ever I mean

481
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,640
I've been covering security now since

482
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,099
2008 and people are still having that

483
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,599
conversation of is cloud secure now

484
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,619
considering that probably the fifth one

485
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,900
they're agile transformation I'll be on

486
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,900
the SEC does suggest you're more use of

487
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,920
like in is aw essence is as your that

488
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,270
doesn't mean cloud should actually be

489
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,900
slightly higher apt nation-state attacks

490
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,360
and malware sort of but just one

491
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,370
slightly above the other there I put

492
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,080
malware second it's just below that

493
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,620
because now I

494
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,300
takes in more general phishing

495
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,280
ransomware that's all the more general

496
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,830
cyberattacks apt nation-state attacks

497
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,450
which was interesting and also just

498
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,480
following the guys from Kaspersky was is

499
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,100
interring that that's come up actually

500
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,590
and I thought that was going to widely

501
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,540
sort of kind of dismissed as a trend

502
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,160
actually but no it turns out that people

503
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,950
do still see apt as a big thing and

504
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,720
maybe that's just the world we live in

505
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,290
now

506
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,750
maybe it's the political situation maybe

507
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,809
it's in there the likes of the NCSC and

508
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,850
various security agencies going around

509
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,220
saying these are the big threats NCSD

510
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,990
did that in a story I wrote a month or

511
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,350
two ago

512
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,030
you know they highlight the big four

513
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,550
threat nations and it's like okay we're

514
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,960
still talking about Russia and China and

515
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,300
Iran the North Korea so it is still a

516
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,490
big deal and just finish off your agile

517
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,679
transformation this when I started doing

518
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,910
the research this was really really

519
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,920
prominent actually in dropped a lot of

520
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,290
people stopped citing it but digital

521
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,610
transformation has been quite an

522
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,860
interesting one for 2019 it's not hard

523
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,820
one to determine actually about how

524
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,140
businesses security key part while the

525
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,110
business tries to be more flexible but

526
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,970
again it did come in literally like the

527
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,429
ten most cited trends so an interesting

528
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,580
one I wanted to get in anyway right and

529
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,010
the single response trends so get a

530
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,790
literally cited by one person you might

531
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,380
look at them and think I can't believe

532
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,240
that that one was only cited by one

533
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,910
person bug bounties for example only one

534
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,330
person who said that government

535
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,500
intervention different from the malware

536
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,820
nation-state thing government

537
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,460
intervention fuzzing and different

538
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,660
audiences I present your front by

539
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,220
breathing it sort of blank faces or

540
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,950
people going yeah yeah buzzing I'm just

541
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,420
behind I presume a lot of people you

542
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,890
know what fuzzing is about automated

543
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,740
software testing so yeah that came in by

544
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,830
one person and certificate transparency

545
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,950
GRC as well as liberal you didn't kind

546
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,890
of go and try and review it again

547
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,450
there's a lot more trends thirty one and

548
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,300
I picked out what like fifteen here I

549
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,940
did get a message from Ben Tom --have

550
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,170
who's been fun today

551
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,820
Bethan to spin and Ben came to me as Ben

552
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,780
is one of the people I did in if you

553
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,280
bent you throughout the gartner didn't

554
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,050
where he works now but he came to me

555
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,520
that she to the DM he sent me

556
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,990
rather supplies there weren't more

557
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,059
response around containerization so it's

558
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:06,610
slightly off screen maybe it's been

559
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,900
there these days that's the web

560
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,980
container so I said alright then well

561
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,480
actually as it turned out to people that

562
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,190
side containers are coming but the other

563
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,700
one was

564
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,320
and these are just some of the comments

565
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,970
that the two people then and the other

566
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,640
guy the person I should say came up a

567
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,540
lot more bang for your buck without

568
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:29,130
overheads solid up tune of kubernetes

569
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,360
supplies well lightweight systems about

570
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,679
those of you who know containers

571
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,440
probably number this is news to you bet

572
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,320
it's hold at containers and mature and

573
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,750
then holding containers bought some old

574
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,780
cross og in the times I've done this

575
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,100
presentation a lot of people that hands

576
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,320
me go have you heard much about someone

577
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,450
said secured textures curse security

578
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,940
defined perimeter and I kind of think no

579
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,690
really

580
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,400
someone said the company to go brexit on

581
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,950
God and so I don't really want to talk

582
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,020
about I just could be picked out very

583
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,220
early on I thought well maybe I should

584
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,059
put this in because it's quite

585
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,790
interesting one that did come up and so

586
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,500
so given is I can put up a Dilbert about

587
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,440
kubernetes so just because it mean also

588
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,730
I had a long conversation on the tube a

589
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,050
couple weeks go the friend of mine which

590
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,550
750 in the morning talking about

591
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,990
kubernetes is not something that most

592
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,890
people want to do ok so I wanted to try

593
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,690
and figure out how this stood up against

594
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,870
other industry research so I went to

595
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,920
five different different levels sort of

596
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,590
write five different lists effectively

597
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,150
Gartner I guess we all know 4.14

598
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,520
mentioned voice the enterprise side

599
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,960
screech ventures you might seen them

600
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,550
Steve Morgan Steve doesn't quite good

601
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,440
research actually very problem LinkedIn

602
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,760
weirdly PwC and then Club C so came in

603
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,230
just before actually did this at info

604
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,490
sake so they've all done these kind of

605
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,580
lists of trends that they determine so

606
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,630
what I do is I thought let's have a look

607
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,650
at what they've done compare it's what

608
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,150
I've got and let's see how much my

609
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,630
stands up and this is maybe not the

610
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,910
easiest to so decipher but these are the

611
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,890
five trends in bold that that I picked

612
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,050
out and again slightly screen slightly

613
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,480
off but yeah take troubles came up three

614
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,550
times twice we've got p CC once we've

615
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,830
got their human factor two different

616
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,559
ones their compliance though only got

617
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:14,390
mentioned by cybersecurity ventures

618
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,190
personal on date privacy no Gartland a

619
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,740
4-5-1 nor club see so i see in

620
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,720
compliance does this mean compliance

621
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,660
doesn't matter anymore no compliance is

622
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,810
huge staff I did a session we did a

623
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,110
two-day online conference recently and I

624
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,300
moderated the compliance session it was

625
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,430
the most listened to entire two days

626
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,750
people still want to talk about

627
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,550
compliance GDP are still keeping people

628
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,620
headaches and still give people probably

629
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,950
nightmares at night so yeah he gave me

630
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,110
the board only one it's it's interesting

631
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,790
that that is that Club see so which I'm

632
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,980
huge amount about Club see so but I know

633
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,910
they're kind of a membership

634
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,480
organization that security culture you

635
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,490
could argue is that part of kind of

636
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,170
engaging with the board and to an extent

637
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,110
maybe how it's but something in

638
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,400
automation has you see everyone certain

639
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,130
that automation it's always everywhere

640
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,960
so ladies what contact that's the main

641
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,970
bulk of that of the main research I say

642
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,470
this came out in June just in time for

643
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,360
info second I launched it on their

644
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,940
Thursday so it's been out for just under

645
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,520
four months now

646
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,780
what I was doing the research only two

647
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,660
trials talk about the future as well and

648
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,040
try and figure out how many people

649
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,000
actually were talking about what's

650
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,070
happening in the future

651
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,410
so about so 33 exactly of the 60 I

652
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,790
talked to actually I asked okay what do

653
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,290
you think's driving is forward what's

654
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,300
really changing things and surprise

655
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,180
surprise it's automation again advanced

656
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,970
automation know as you see some of the

657
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,760
comments we've picked out here I think I

658
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,530
did three lesson last year actually

659
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,690
adoption of AI and automation as a

660
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,760
future training was 28 percent this time

661
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,230
it was so high above everything else was

662
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,700
probably under 10 percent it wasn't even

663
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,770
worth doing a top 10 because you know it

664
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,600
sort of fragmented percentage versus a

665
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,530
36 percent automation so this was kind

666
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,850
of the main thing really for the future

667
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,750
now what I was doing this was a couple

668
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,770
months ago I was thinking okay I want to

669
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,750
try and this is all very nice to see but

670
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,400
what I want to try understand is how

671
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,230
this effects like people coming into the

672
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,880
industry and how do these or trends

673
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,130
really resonate with people looking for

674
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,760
jobs

675
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,650
now one thing it we do info security is

676
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,810
current we've quite keen on promoting

677
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,370
opportunities to like newspaper work

678
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,570
with next-gen we have a section on the

679
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,770
website specifically for new people

680
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,210
coming to the industry we soar feature

681
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,880
them we yell and learn promote their

682
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,180
work do some writing for us we do

683
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,650
so I thought let's try and tap into that

684
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,230
and see where we go in terms of these

685
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,480
trends and how how much they resonate

686
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,750
with the with the next people coming in

687
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,900
so this is very much still going on to

688
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,190
the point that I was literally updating

689
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,460
slides last night and numbers so I think

690
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,850
to be about 50 people so far when you're

691
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,980
doing a survey of industry professionals

692
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,030
they're people caught there are groups

693
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,530
people call PR companies where you can

694
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,670
email them and you get about 12

695
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,720
interviews in a bad day when students is

696
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,310
a little hard let's put it that way I

697
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,290
can put out on Twitter and I can tag in

698
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,910
organizations and hacking societies I

699
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,230
don't get anyone responding so I have to

700
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,330
go through LinkedIn and find you all so

701
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,890
if anyone here has been responding to my

702
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,510
emails I really appreciate it if you're

703
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,710
feeling like I'm annoying you please

704
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,650
tell me to go away I've been really

705
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,790
clean used to try and get a really good

706
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,610
demographic together of people so and

707
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,560
special thanks again to crest and slide

708
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,150
security challenge who actually did some

709
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,390
amazing to their their database and this

710
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,590
summit we're actually kind of wrapping

711
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,700
this up actually I'm going to probably

712
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,260
do about another few more days of just

713
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,180
trying to get some research done we're

714
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,010
gonna publish what I'm about to show you

715
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,870
as a series of articles on info security

716
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,790
which will be free to read and I'll

717
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,490
probably do the the numbers so what I

718
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,560
wanted to do was pick out I picked out

719
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,420
seven questions or share this very stat

720
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,850
heavy presentation but seven questions

721
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,500
that I picked out from those top five

722
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,780
trends or only top five to ten friends

723
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,880
and figure out how the people who are

724
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,280
coming into the industry deal with that

725
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,140
so one question asked this is very mind

726
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,970
that the top thing about tech troubles

727
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,040
and detection and all that kind of thing

728
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,130
so are people who can't disappear you've

729
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,110
got yours either at university like work

730
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,460
placements or maybe out the first year

731
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,530
or two of their job are they ready to

732
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,650
deal with malware and so at so far as of

733
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,050
I'm kind of like this morning about 51

734
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,320
people answer this one so 33 I said yes

735
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,260
and 18 I've been given no or a Mormon

736
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,270
negative response here's just a few

737
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:27,000
comments more to be done more routine

738
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,830
not without industry experience I

739
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,100
wouldn't know really how to respond

740
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,870
I would never respond after an attack

741
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,910
but covering all the bases again you

742
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,170
know it's a team effort as we're

743
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,789
probably aware

744
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:42,369
and so undergraduate leave the education

745
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:45,429
as giving me knowledge so much more

746
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:46,720
positive response people not feeling

747
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,669
that everything is terrible that they're

748
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,409
terrified by the concept of reverse

749
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,999
engineering and you know suddenly a kind

750
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,129
of a ransomware lock down but the same

751
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,840
time and more people think this is

752
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,609
actually something they're ready for so

753
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:58,749
that was why I picked this one because

754
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,190
of the tech trouble thing being number

755
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,169
one number two was now this is because

756
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,159
of I mentioned AWS as your and IaaS is

757
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,989
kind of a huge thing now we seem to

758
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:12,070
become it's covering this all the time

759
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,570
not just with the problems security

760
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,279
problems with it but actually how to

761
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,379
work with it so is there enough out

762
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:20,139
there are the curriculums keeping up

763
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,029
really so so far we got 52 people

764
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:25,299
respond to this and yeah pretty negative

765
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:27,429
she's 34 percent if you are in have a

766
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,440
training curriculum and not this isn't

767
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,789
me firing a gun at you this is me just

768
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,769
sort of saying you know this is what

769
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:35,019
people are saying back to was just a few

770
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,080
comments back however this really is

771
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,669
available people just don't take it you

772
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:43,299
can find stuff on the web you how it

773
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,279
works completely you'll see another

774
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,080
chair question put on this in just a

775
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,529
second personal research stuff is out

776
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:51,999
there if you want to train it it also is

777
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,259
probably training going on at most

778
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:54,759
conferences and things like that we can

779
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,820
she find out what you need and also oh

780
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,309
sorry I thought was one more no well

781
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:02,460
there we go right next one was

782
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,419
compliance that's a top-five thing with

783
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,970
compliance and this is one a fewer

784
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,679
states so far about 49 people answer

785
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,149
this I did share this on Twitter and

786
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:11,379
LinkedIn if anybody wants to talk but

787
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,809
we'll get inside in a minute with

788
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,159
compliance being such a popular trend

789
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:17,440
are we seeing more demand for GRC skills

790
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,590
in job ads 380 50/50 slightly more yes

791
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,029
the sort of thing I got from Twitter

792
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:26,979
tweeted yesterday about this people

793
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:29,729
saying actually yes we are seeing this

794
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:32,169
the most people hiring actually they are

795
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,460
people are looking for all-rounders

796
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,409
which will go into w another question

797
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,109
but just some of the comments we had

798
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:39,220
discussion coming up more often people

799
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,419
understand government frisking

800
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,460
compliance and compliance this

801
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,799
particular job we're still very tech

802
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,119
focused but job you're looking for I

803
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,080
suppose if you're not looking for

804
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,929
something with GRC it's not a huge thing

805
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,149
maybe but

806
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:54,210
seen this especially risk ones where job

807
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,859
alerts are in this area people probably

808
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,539
studio PR is a bigger issue is becoming

809
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,539
I have become a bigger issue CCPA if

810
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,349
you're dealing with companies in

811
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:04,139
California PCI doesn't go away PSD to

812
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:07,349
which is about payment services and does

813
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,029
reflect quite a lot of stuff about GDP

814
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:12,539
are probably worth looking at and yeah

815
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,279
it's worth looking at and you can Akamai

816
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,599
Oscar on the info security if you want

817
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,099
because I wrote about that recently so

818
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:19,830
yeah that's PSD to next question then

819
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,009
was oh sorry one more crisis is always

820
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:24,389
mentioned for audio forensics rolls

821
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:28,080
right next one so know about compliance

822
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,269
now these are the framework to mean like

823
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,960
PC IPS and PCI PSD to GD P RS gets the

824
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,729
easy it lost with them do you understand

825
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:38,159
what they mean how they different so so

826
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,749
far 52 people have answered that

827
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:43,529
majority and more positive 35% only 17

828
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,719
say no maybe just because it's been all

829
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:48,859
over the news and it's hard to avoid it

830
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:51,299
again it's very much this feeling of

831
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,710
like you're able to teach yourself this

832
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,999
you can pick all this this stuff up

833
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,279
pretty easily and gets up to speed with

834
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,389
the basics lack of education maybe just

835
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:01,859
because universities it's it's something

836
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:04,409
that's rapid and is actually you know

837
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:05,969
moving along very quickly so maybe it's

838
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:07,139
not something they can adapt to that

839
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,249
quickly I love that not heard of PSD to

840
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:13,200
again what we worth looking up on if you

841
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,279
haven't come across it yeah there's

842
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,769
quite a lot of the material on there now

843
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:19,080
this was a just sort of following all

844
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,399
the compliance and the cloud thing we

845
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,080
asked would you expect to company to

846
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,450
train you on the job

847
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,639
yeah pretty unsurprisingly 39 percent of

848
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:29,339
the 52 said 39 39 percent expected only

849
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:31,830
total of the 52 we asked have actually

850
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,330
said yes or giving us a more of a

851
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:39,029
positive response so it's you know two

852
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:40,289
of the biggest themes with around at the

853
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:41,279
moment are actually being able to work

854
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,769
in these kind of cloud environments it

855
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:45,239
would expect training it feels business

856
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:48,509
requirement they should companies when

857
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:49,769
paper training if they don't have to

858
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:51,179
take great training around online

859
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,210
training if you can you know afford it

860
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,019
or you have all the time to do it and

861
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:59,309
yeah should in training your employees

862
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:01,409
Randers that'll throw them in probably

863
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,940
to train them and people leave but

864
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,679
that's ladies

865
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,320
almost there so this is the this kind of

866
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,640
a huge thing going around actually

867
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,880
around levels of experience

868
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,490
qualifications we've seen this around in

869
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,350
research and it probably ones look out

870
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,230
here is I Sarkar but I'm where job ads

871
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,820
are sort of saying you know come enjoy

872
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,140
come work for us all when you need your

873
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,059
sis which was five years in from a five

874
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,890
years experience okay well you wouldn't

875
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,210
go in on day one start your sips

876
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,309
training you're going on two years so

877
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:30,600
that means you might have seven years

878
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,919
which means you're probably twenty eight

879
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,690
which by that stage you might want to

880
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,100
buy a house if you're lucky if you don't

881
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,260
live in London and or a city

882
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,580
maybe Belfast the same now but yeah I'm

883
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,809
achievable levels of experience of

884
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,100
coalification which is preventing people

885
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,010
from actually starting the job at all so

886
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,370
yeah slightly split slightly more in

887
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,179
favor of the of the positive and they

888
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,539
are see the job ads they require degrees

889
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,340
some of you might still be at university

890
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,140
or to the people we are talking to were

891
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,820
some momentary worse after that

892
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,919
university it's kinda hard to reach

893
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,179
those people who've got straight in

894
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,799
without degrees unfortunately it's just

895
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,270
that's the way things are working which

896
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,380
isn't the ideal recruiters don't know

897
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,380
what they want or need and I think most

898
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,080
people can probably resonate with that

899
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,429
and next one fourteen year olds they

900
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:24,690
want to be cyber ninja straight out of

901
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,730
uni and pay them entry-level wages at

902
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,809
self I someone cynical

903
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:29,730
it was probably Brian they've probably

904
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,830
gave me that but yeah that is actually

905
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,720
the yeah yeah one bit Brian cuz he's not

906
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,940
a next gen person he's older than me so

907
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,549
yes people entry-level wages that's

908
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,080
unfortunate problem the way things are

909
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,590
and have communication noticed of course

910
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,419
with the board engagements that we put

911
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,370
in there had they been taught to a level

912
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,600
that you're comfortable with are you

913
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,240
able to trap and stage like I am and

914
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,770
wing it for a living

915
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,600
you know you are you able to present in

916
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,419
your hacking societies or things like

917
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,659
that and again quite good numbers pretty

918
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,279
splitter she 51 26 percent said yes

919
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:06,000
someone comfortable it hasn't been

920
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,830
taught see if you know actually be able

921
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,110
to communicate cyber issues to a board

922
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,110
and the CEO or anyone in the industry

923
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,220
and actually try and figure out what

924
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,510
thing is going are you anyways you talk

925
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,909
about it emphasis is being put on these

926
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:18,480
abilities

927
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,530
if you can't look someone in the eye and

928
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,750
explain what wanna cry is or heartbleed

929
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,470
is then you've got that sort of overcome

930
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,630
and yourself and being able to defy

931
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,020
producers in any organization right I

932
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,780
think that's the last stat yes I just

933
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,220
put onto the conclusion just sort of

934
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,490
penultimate slide these are kinda just

935
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,049
why I drew up from my own sort of

936
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:41,400
feeling and so detection still a real

937
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,890
problem for businesses however people

938
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,270
have a comfortable dealing with malware

939
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,549
and incidents so it's things are getting

940
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:50,580
a little bit brighter compliance even

941
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,840
though it's a very present people

942
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,970
getting better cloud isn't ever-present

943
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,960
doesn't go away

944
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,460
I think to believe the hype and

945
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,610
automation automation things uh you know

946
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,410
it's not going away it's two years

947
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,090
present now the automation spin there

948
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,549
and don't expect it to be so if we do

949
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:07,350
this again in 2020 will price affect

950
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,460
automation to go even higher because

951
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,129
poor people are talking about it so just

952
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:13,350
finish up then so if you don't report

953
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,570
download this the white paper which is

954
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,070
the original report is available for

955
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,290
this URL white papers go back to about

956
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,440
June I think June sickling he came out

957
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,489
the next gen stuff I've just been going

958
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:24,480
through I'll be writing those up for

959
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,710
interface security they'll be free to

960
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,899
read much need to get around to doing it

961
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,850
if you want to follow me I'm at then

962
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,230
ready when we're at info security mag

963
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,940
and that's my email address if you order

964
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,560
I'm still looking for a few more people

965
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,850
I'm gonna wrap up the research in about

966
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,379
the next week or so if you do want to

967
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:38,550
drop me an email and say yeah I'd love

968
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,500
to answer some questions and as you can

969
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,699
see the numbers everything's anonymize

970
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,168
no one's being named no one's been

971
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,159
shamed or anything like that

972
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,830
it's all it's all good so with that I

973
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,918
think I'm about three minutes under and

974
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:51,418
I will wrap up there any questions let

975
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:52,949
me know otherwise huge thanks for coming

976
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:55,109
today and I'll be collapsing in the

977
00:34:55,109 --> 00:35:00,440
corner somewhere Thanks thank you Dan

978
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,790
anybody have any questions yes of course

979
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:10,670
we have a serial question go that's good

980
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,970
just in terms of the automation I

981
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,490
noticed that you were sort of conflating

982
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,390
that with AI but I mean in my hair mind

983
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,250
sort of in the security space automation

984
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,920
would be a much broader scope today I'm

985
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,180
just wondering like is that what was

986
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,710
coming through from the responses you're

987
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,089
getting I think it's because we want to

988
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:31,410
try and throw is quite an umbrella term

989
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,640
a lot of people would talk about AI am

990
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,810
machine I look we don't have split the

991
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,819
vote to half we want to try and get it

992
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:37,470
under one umbrella a lot of this was if

993
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,579
we broke me down we'd even have more

994
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,010
than 31 friends I can't we saying yeah

995
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,810
it is probably two different things AI

996
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,540
is probably much if you put it this

997
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,920
automation of machine learning we prefer

998
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,300
on AI probably doesn't even fit it at

999
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,329
all I would suspect that industry is

1000
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,770
itself is actually putting those two

1001
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,490
things together

1002
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,380
AI machine learning under a broader

1003
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,020
spectrum of automation I guess someone

1004
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,400
like me to determine if I want to keep

1005
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,890
doing that but now I get we're saying

1006
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,000
yeah II think it's probably one of those

1007
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,109
things that we actually would look at

1008
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:05,609
and say you know actually next year if

1009
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:08,220
we do this again we might split the part

1010
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,020
so yeah though I was just thinking that

1011
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,460
control even like with automation of

1012
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,810
machine learning to me an automation

1013
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,390
would be like things like a sim dev

1014
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,880
where they would take the use case that

1015
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,170
the staff could develop and that's like

1016
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,450
human learning yet they're putting that

1017
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,510
into an automated form for dissection

1018
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,829
yeah I totally get that I think oh yeah

1019
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:27,960
it's something we probably consider if

1020
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,190
we did this again yep don't appreciate

1021
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,660
you thank you thank you

1022
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,599
any more scanning scanning scanning

1023
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,950
scanning 360 it after a couple of years

1024
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,440
of doing this is there anything that

1025
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,420
surprises you that hasn't been in the

1026
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,810
reports such as industry like such as

1027
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,780
IOT yours Allison Nelson came up yeah

1028
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,829
that's that's a great point IOT yeah I

1029
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:57,180
probably have actually got the array the

1030
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,010
first he was about 31 so counting them

1031
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,800
yeah IOT I think would be one I would be

1032
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,780
surprised that ransomware as a sole

1033
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,819
trend didn't come out more I think we

1034
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:07,319
put it in as malware cuz there's a lot

1035
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:09,990
of people citing you know web most

1036
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,050
web-based attacks I'll probably fishing

1037
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,450
in there just get ransomware is an

1038
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,710
interesting one fishy for this year

1039
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,849
because it was being predicted to be

1040
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,490
over and then gang crab retire and then

1041
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,220
they came back again and now it's it's a

1042
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,869
consistent trend again I think we

1043
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:26,160
come back but yeah that would probably

1044
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,599
IOT would be an interesting was I think

1045
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,130
a lot of people in mobile as well

1046
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,960
actually Mobile's not really been in

1047
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,670
this might fall under agile and

1048
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,469
transformation actually mobile but I

1049
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,210
still get people coming to me that you

1050
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,400
want to write about BYOD did we not do

1051
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,759
this ten years ago with with iPhones but

1052
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,650
yeah maybe mobile IOT and that might

1053
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,089
inform the same trend for people so

1054
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:47,130
promote working but no it's good good

1055
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,660
point yet all right done thank you very

1056
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
much they thank you over my man

1057
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,770
[Applause]
