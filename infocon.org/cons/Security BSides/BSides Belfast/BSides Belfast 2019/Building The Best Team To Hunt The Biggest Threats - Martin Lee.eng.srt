1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,430
you

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,400
thank you right thank you very much good

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,580
morning everyone my name's Martin Lee

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,639
I'm also part of Talos I have the

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,900
pleasure of managing the Telus outreach

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,410
team within amia a little bit about me

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,890
I've worked in security now for almost

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,619
17 years for the past four years

9
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,660
managing the Telus outreach team across

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,660
Europe before that I was working here in

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,350
Belfast for alert logic prior to that it

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,390
was also at Cisco you can't really

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,770
escape Cisco they're a bit like the

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,080
Mafia once you've worked for them they

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,080
they pull you back in eventually and

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,690
then for many years before that I worked

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,080
for message labs in Gloucester detecting

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,250
threats coming in over over email I am a

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,720
very keen if not particularly fast or

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,880
indeed in any way talented runner but I

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,070
do enjoy it and when I'm not hunting

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,069
threats I tend to be out into the into

23
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,220
the hills running and I'm also a

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,530
recycled human viral geneticist I

25
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,480
started my career researching the

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,360
genetics of human viruses before

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,160
basically by accident ending up in

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,760
security but I'm very glad that I'm here

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,060
as a sponsor of the conference you have

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,350
one obligatory a semi marketing slide

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,450
which is this which is what we do in

32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,729
Cisco talis we are

33
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,650
Cisco's threat intelligence and security

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,890
research organization so what we do in

35
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,130
the wider group is follow the telemetry

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,870
and the intelligence the information

37
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,090
that we have about what's happening in

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,299
the threat landscape understanding what

39
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,340
the bad guys are up to and what those

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,920
attacks look like and then using that

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,590
information to power

42
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,930
Cisco's product security product

43
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,090
offering so that we can protect

44
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,490
customers against the threats that are

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,350
out there but in order to protect

46
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,119
against these threats you actually have

47
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,450
to understand what

48
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,940
happening and most importantly be able

49
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,200
to spot what is new what is different

50
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,660
and what you actually need to

51
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,120
concentrate on and understand how the

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,730
threat landscapes shifting and this is

53
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,650
what we specialize in as part of the

54
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,720
outreach team what we do is work on

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,120
analyzing the intelligence that we've

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,069
got spotting what is different and

57
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,390
understanding that and we've actually

58
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,209
been very very successful in what we do

59
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,459
in Earl and Edmund have just talked

60
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:44,890
about sea turtle so here we have a

61
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,000
nation-state threat actor undermining

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,099
one of the fundamental protocols that

63
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:55,060
allows the internet to function we also

64
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,180
we identified VPN filter this was a

65
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,840
network of 500,000 compromised small

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,239
office/home office reuters across the

67
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,780
globe that were poised to launch a giant

68
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,790
attack we don't know what that attack

69
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,680
was because we managed to stop that

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,970
attack before it happened

71
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,040
working with our partners in the public

72
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,410
sector to take down the commander

73
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,660
commute a command and control networks

74
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,880
of the threat actor so they couldn't

75
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,799
launch an attack and there's a load of

76
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,019
other stuff that we found we found

77
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,859
various rats remote access Trojans we've

78
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,010
also identified a previously unknown apt

79
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,959
group which is particularly interested

80
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,359
about the Korean Peninsula and we're

81
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,600
also identified a bad rabbit which is a

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,350
criminal ransomware that appears to have

83
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,540
been derived from the same source code

84
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,310
that was used in not Pecha which is also

85
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,420
quite an interesting observation so not

86
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,549
only are we finding these very very

87
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,160
interesting things first I'm also

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,079
incredibly proud to say that we're an

89
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,380
award-winning team se magazine

90
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,410
recognized us as having found the most

91
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,630
important cybersecurity discovery by a

92
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,480
company research team this this year and

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,669
Paul who's in the audience and Warren

94
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,829
were the recipients of the Peter saw

95
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:16,899
reward from virus bulletins for there

96
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,959
research on on sea turtle this year so I

97
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,330
like to think this is evidenced that

98
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,509
we're doing something right the trick is

99
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:27,039
is well or what are we actually doing

100
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:33,820
and what is special about what we do and

101
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,130
how we operate that allows us to find

102
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,120
this and I think to be fair what we do

103
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,180
has more or less happened by accident

104
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,210
there hasn't been a grand plan but we've

105
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,759
been trying to implement there is no

106
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,539
manual out there of how to manage or how

107
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:57,070
to make function a threat a threat

108
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,310
research or a threat intelligence team

109
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,139
but I do get out and get to talk to an

110
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,639
awful lot of organizations that are

111
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,090
trying to do the same thing as us many

112
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,449
of them less successful and some of them

113
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:13,080
to be fair have basically failed in

114
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,550
creating a threat intelligence team so

115
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,289
it's very interesting to compare what it

116
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,169
is that we do with other organizations

117
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,240
and also especially those that really

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,099
haven't managed to get such a team

119
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,740
functioning and I think it it really

120
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,020
starts with these assumptions of how do

121
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,550
you actually go out and hunt threats

122
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,199
naively people tend to think it's like

123
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,900
some kind of sausage machine and you put

124
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,690
in at the top data you know lots and

125
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,360
lots of data a big dollop of data you

126
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,409
mix that in with some tools probably a

127
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,120
seam solution because that gives you a

128
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,820
nice dashboard and then you've got some

129
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,530
kind of procedures that are that are

130
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,750
carved in stone that are rigid and what

131
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,729
it is that you have to do you turn this

132
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:59,289
handle of the sausage machine and you

133
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,440
find threats coming out of of it in fact

134
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,300
no this is absolutely not what we do the

135
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,060
way that we function is more to think

136
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,190
about threat hunting as a stack of

137
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,310
technology we certainly need data we

138
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,710
need you know data forms the hunting

139
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,540
ground

140
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,600
in which you're going to hunt threats

141
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,880
this data can come from many sources it

142
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,710
can be internal coming off your own

143
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,320
networks from your own telemetry from

144
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,970
your own visibility of what's happening

145
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,810
on the Internet

146
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,620
it can also come from external sources

147
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,750
the both of private and public sources

148
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,420
that you can tap into that anyone can

149
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,690
use to hunt threats as I said sea turtle

150
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,820
where I primarily identified through

151
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,420
passive DNS which is available to anyone

152
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,670
and also through virus Topa which again

153
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,730
is available to anyone so you don't

154
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,840
necessarily need this secret magic store

155
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,250
of data which only you can access you

156
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,580
certainly need some kind of tooling this

157
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,250
is quite in my opinion quite a narrow

158
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,420
and thin layer within this spec we need

159
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,510
some way that we can ask questions of

160
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,770
the data and get back answers but far

161
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,440
far more important than that tooling is

162
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,720
actually having the right people having

163
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,790
people with the right skills and most

164
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,550
importantly the right attitude in order

165
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,030
to hunt threats and those people thrive

166
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,650
in the right culture you can absolutely

167
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,620
kill the best people with the right

168
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,630
tooling in the right in the right data

169
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,700
environment if you have the wrong

170
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,060
culture this culture piece I cannot

171
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,930
emphasize just how important it is to

172
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,520
enable and encourage people to hunt

173
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,170
threats I'll come to that in a moment

174
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,630
and then also there's this very very

175
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,730
thin layer on top which is kind of the

176
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,350
management bit which is which is that

177
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,540
strategy we need to have some kind of

178
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,880
direction but realistically this is a

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,220
very very small part of the writ of

180
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,400
the--of the mix that strategy for me

181
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,250
fundamentally is just two questions

182
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,580
you've got to have some idea of what it

183
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,520
is that you want to find if you have no

184
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
idea what it is that you're looking for

185
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,480
you will never find it but if you have

186
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,990
at least some goal this is the type of

187
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,450
thing that we're looking for then you

188
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,240
stand a chance to be able to find it or

189
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,130
to recognize it when you stumble across

190
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,640
it there's also this other piece what

191
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,060
are you going to do when you find it

192
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,070
it's all very you know well and good

193
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,290
finding things maybe in finding that

194
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,350
your network has been penetrated by a in

195
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,140
a criminal hacker or an apt gang but

196
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,560
unless you actually have a plan what it

197
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,810
is that you're gonna do once you find

198
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,430
this then well you might as well not

199
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,410
have bothered if you can't resolve it if

200
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,850
you can't do something with it

201
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,340
then really what was the point in

202
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,000
looking and finding something for us I

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,940
think these questions actually have very

204
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,360
very clear answers what it is that we do

205
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,370
in our team we are looking for the most

206
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,020
significant new threats that are

207
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,300
happening on the Internet we see our

208
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,820
role within talis of where the guys that

209
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,670
protect the entire internet we're

210
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,530
looking out for everyone that's on the

211
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,500
internet we want to hunt down and find

212
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,770
the bad guys find the new things that

213
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,590
they are doing be the first people that

214
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,860
find these things so that we can protect

215
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,320
our customers and protect the internet

216
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,860
as a whole and also most importantly

217
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,170
inform the community inform everyone you

218
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,610
know if you don't know what the bad guys

219
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,950
are doing then you won't know that

220
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,690
actually you need to protect yourself

221
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,330
against this so actually being public

222
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,030
talking about the threats talking about

223
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,070
how that threat landscape is changing

224
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,450
and what you need to do to protect

225
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,060
yourself against that is a very very key

226
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,560
part of what we do and this is

227
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,210
ultimately what it is that we're trying

228
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,710
to achieve to find these these threats

229
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,690
we need to adapt the intelligence cycle

230
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,030
so this is something that that's come

231
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,650
out of military intelligence since the

232
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,780
Second World War when the the military

233
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,610
was faced with a problem how on earth do

234
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,010
you get soldiers to the right place on

235
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,960
the battleground where the enemy

236
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,769
actually

237
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,160
is in a lot of cases in the Second World

238
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,439
War you've got groups of soldiers entire

239
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,300
regiments wandering around trying to

240
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,129
find the enemy and when they get there

241
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:52,269
where they think the enemy is the

242
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:55,269
enemies actually moved on and so over

243
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:57,369
the past seventy eight years or so we've

244
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:00,279
had this maturation in the intelligence

245
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,839
community of trying to define what

246
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,689
intelligence is and how it acts and it

247
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,670
starts at that bit at the top with the

248
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,610
planning and direction firstly it starts

249
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,639
with just a question you know what is it

250
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,699
that we're hoping to find what is it

251
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:22,329
that we are looking for and then to go

252
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:25,480
out and find the data that could

253
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,329
actually support the question that it is

254
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:30,040
that we're trying to ask so we're

255
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,779
starting with a question what are we

256
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,209
looking to find we need to have the data

257
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,730
to which we can ask that question so we

258
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,579
can get out a response in in the world

259
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,589
of IT very very quickly I mean you can

260
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:42,999
all come up with some very very good

261
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,829
questions that you'd like to ask your

262
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,019
network and your systems and your users

263
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,689
about what a particular threat might

264
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,240
look like on it but when you start

265
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,160
asking those questions and start looking

266
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,529
for the data almost certainly you will

267
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,740
find that the data that you have doesn't

268
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,899
actually allow you to get an answer for

269
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,360
that question that you would like and so

270
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,889
to begin with we go through an iterative

271
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:08,069
process we'd like to ask this question

272
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,199
but actually we we just don't have the

273
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,720
data to ask that nevertheless in looking

274
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,490
at this data we can find it yeah there

275
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,740
are actually quite interesting questions

276
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,910
that we could ask of it nevertheless

277
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,980
which are kind of similar to that

278
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,230
question that we started with so we have

279
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,730
this process at the beginning of going

280
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,169
back and forth looking at the data that

281
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:27,939
we have thinking about the questions

282
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,189
that we'd like to ask until we come to

283
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:33,040
an interesting question that's relevant

284
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,929
that's going to be useful and we have

285
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,689
the data that can support that and then

286
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,480
we go out and we collect that data we

287
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,279
process it we collect in various

288
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,709
different sources analyze that to

289
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:47,499
understand what it is that we found

290
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:50,139
what's the context how does this fit

291
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,910
what can we actually do with this and

292
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,630
then in our case

293
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,820
emanate that get that information to the

294
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,600
people to whom it is useful but the

295
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,150
magic really happens in that processing

296
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,280
and analysis and data collection part

297
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,800
and there's a number of techniques that

298
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,580
we can use to make sense of the data

299
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,110
that we have the typical bit is really

300
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,170
just classical in engineering as

301
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,650
engineers we love to have repeatable and

302
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,830
predictable processes with nice defined

303
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,620
inputs and outputs and we can put

304
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,810
something in at the beginning we can

305
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,950
follow some nice procedure and come out

306
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,290
to a nice predictable end of where we

307
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,930
have a nice clean answer to the question

308
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,600
that we answered this is great this is

309
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,640
really the holy grail of what we want to

310
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,780
get to a very good example of that in a

311
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,160
typical type of thing that you'll find

312
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,710
in a threat hunting team a new threat

313
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,140
intelligence report will come out it'll

314
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,120
have indicators are compromised within

315
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,090
that a very very sensible question to

316
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,810
start with is okay in my system in my

317
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,740
environment

318
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,800
have we been hit by this do we have

319
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,220
these indicators of compromise within

320
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,570
our systems and so we kick off this nice

321
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,460
predictable repeatable process we will

322
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,440
look through the data that we have we

323
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,720
will look to see whether we've got these

324
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,490
indicators of compromise and we will

325
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,040
come out with a nice clean yes/no at the

326
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,050
end of it lovely

327
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,450
people do this time and time again and

328
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,830
they tend to come out with the answer no

329
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,260
why well because within the report

330
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,630
you're just gonna have one set of ICS

331
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,880
for one particular attack and if the

332
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,130
attacker has changed a single bite in

333
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,420
his malware you're gonna have a

334
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,420
different hash value the attacker may

335
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,400
well be using a different domain a

336
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,710
slightly different IP address when he's

337
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,350
attacking you so actually if you're only

338
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,950
looking for IO C's that are published

339
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,890
elsewhere within your data to be honest

340
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,870
you're unlikely to find anything you

341
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,800
might be left

342
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,850
but probably not I think the question

343
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,780
that you should be asking is what might

344
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,310
such an attack look like within in our

345
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,040
environment so we're not specifically

346
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,350
asking the indexes have you seen this

347
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,230
we're thinking well if such an attack

348
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,950
happened what traces would it leave in

349
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,830
the data that we have but we could look

350
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,560
for and this process is actually

351
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,510
something it's quite different it's a

352
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,270
very innovative process we have to think

353
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,240
about our system our environment our

354
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,980
data what might those traces look like

355
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,970
it's not a nice clean predictable

356
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,670
process the outcome might actually be

357
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,310
undeterminable I mean may well come to

358
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,500
an answer which is well we simply don't

359
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,550
know or hmm probably not we're 80% sure

360
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,860
but we haven't seen this but if you keep

361
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,920
doing this sooner or later you will find

362
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,660
something which is interesting and

363
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,520
something which is worthy of further

364
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,680
investigation and identify something

365
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,260
significant what we really want our

366
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,860
analysts to continuously ask is these

367
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,400
questions what if what if this hand what

368
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,500
would it look like what else might be

369
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,320
happening and make this a process of

370
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,900
introspection and continuing asking of

371
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,570
the data what else what might be

372
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,210
happening what might I be seeing how do

373
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,060
I find this within the data when we come

374
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,750
across new ways of asking questions of

375
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,550
our data and looking for outliers and

376
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,530
modeling it and finding it this is the

377
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,120
type of thing that when we get a success

378
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,950
we can turn this owner into a into an

379
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,620
automated procedure this kind of world

380
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,530
is perfect for machines to operate this

381
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,420
is not what you want your people to be

382
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,630
doing this is a waste of human resources

383
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,550
of that ingenuity of that

384
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,920
professionalism of the sense of a

385
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,839
but you want to create within a set

386
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,599
within a threat hunting team this is the

387
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,220
type of thing that you want your threat

388
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,189
hunters doing asking questions thinking

389
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,679
what if what else what might be

390
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,250
happening

391
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,380
what might this be looking what might

392
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,740
this look like so what I really really

393
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,099
don't want you to do is to create an

394
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,540
assembly line

395
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,299
you know the 20th century way of working

396
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,970
where we have people on very very

397
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,830
tightly defined work and

398
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,679
responsibilities conducting repetitive

399
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,929
tasks following tightly defined

400
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,850
procedures which are chiseled in stone

401
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,090
which have never changed for a manager

402
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,290
it's great because it's really really

403
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,720
easy to measure a reward we look at the

404
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,669
people that are performing these

405
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,940
procedures the fastest so how many how

406
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,950
many firewall alerts did you resolve

407
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,470
today you know are wow I'd resolve my

408
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,179
firewall alerts in less than five

409
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,090
minutes each you know why why are you

410
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,600
doing this it makes no sense what we

411
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
want is to create a 21st century way of

412
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,490
working which is a very very different

413
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,520
way of doing things we need people to

414
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,240
collaborate and share ideas and come up

415
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,910
with new ways of doing things new

416
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,549
questions that they can ask of the data

417
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:25,559
new ways of modeling it new ways of

418
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,270
searching for things and be very very

419
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,700
open to new ideas and cultivating that

420
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,100
to get to that point we need to be

421
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,919
oriented around a goal not how many

422
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,410
firewall alerts have you resolved in a

423
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,260
day not how many tickets have you closed

424
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,590
but how have you actually contributed to

425
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,290
what it is that we are trying to do and

426
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,360
this is the outcome that we will measure

427
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,240
a key thing to remember about being

428
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,730
innovative and trying to do new things

429
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,630
you will mostly fail most times you will

430
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,360
get it wrong and you will just find

431
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,400
nothing but that's actually what you

432
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,710
need to do we need to go through many

433
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,100
many ideas of trying out new ideas again

434
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,700
and again

435
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,019
again until we find something that works

436
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,130
but that's great this is what we've got

437
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,010
to do have lots of ideas recognize that

438
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,990
most of them aren't gonna work but never

439
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,610
mind that's fine we'll just fail fast

440
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,639
fail early and move on not invest too

441
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:29,460
much of our own selves in our ideas but

442
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,620
just try them out see if it works if it

443
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,539
looks interesting brilliant let's keep

444
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,029
going but actually most of them they're

445
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:37,440
they're probably not going to work but

446
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,289
that's fine in our own team what this

447
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:42,409
actually looks like and I spent ages

448
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:45,389
searching for a stock photo that would

449
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:48,809
illustrate our way of working and yeah

450
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,899
mostly it looks like this it's a bloke

451
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,130
on his sofa with these dogs and a laptop

452
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,840
with in the European team we all work

453
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,559
remotely we all work from home and yeah

454
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,750
this is a very very similar way to the

455
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,380
way that I work but for us this works

456
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,889
very very well indeed and the key things

457
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:12,720
that I think means that we are

458
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,200
successful is that we have a very very

459
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,929
strong sense of mission of what it is

460
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,659
that we're trying to do we're the team

461
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:23,880
that hunts down the bad guys on the

462
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,880
internet we find them first we protect

463
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,059
the internet this is a very very strong

464
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,210
sense of what it is that we're trying to

465
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,399
do and that strong sense of mission

466
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:38,610
itself drives a very high degree of self

467
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,929
motivation that itself also drives lots

468
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:45,299
and lots of peer collaboration because

469
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,460
people want to find things they want to

470
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,289
hunt want to find it first

471
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,809
the hunger to fulfill our mission to

472
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,679
work together across the team keep that

473
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,480
motivation high even though we're all

474
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,250
working remotely and we're collaborating

475
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,000
over remote working systems and

476
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,639
encouraging each other to keep going and

477
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,740
keep looking what do you think of this

478
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,889
what if we tried that and it turns out

479
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:13,440
and it becomes that actually what we do

480
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,250
it's not really a job it's actually a

481
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,870
lifestyle and that works because we can

482
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,789
build in a lot of flexibility into the

483
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:24,620
way that we were

484
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,270
if you want to take your dogs to the

485
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,040
vets in the middle of the day that's

486
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,570
fine you want to collect your children

487
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,360
from school absolutely fine because I

488
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,050
know that comes six seven eight pm at

489
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,300
night and on the weekends you are still

490
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,980
gonna have that hunger because you want

491
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,930
to know what your scripts are finding

492
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,880
what are the bad guys doing what are

493
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,710
they looking for so for us this works

494
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,350
very very well indeed but Brian as you

495
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,660
said it's all about passion it's all

496
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,520
about having the passion it's all about

497
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,140
wanting to make the difference and

498
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,470
wanting to hunt down the bad guys so if

499
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,870
I take sea turtle as as an example

500
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,790
obviously Earl and Edmund went into this

501
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,670
and far much much more detail

502
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,650
technically but I think it's interesting

503
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,950
to to look more at the process and the

504
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,950
environment in which this happened so it

505
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,890
did all start with this taunt we have

506
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,380
someone making fun of us on the Internet

507
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,880
no way

508
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,760
[ __ ] him down so clearly we want to

509
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,730
find this threat actor and you know he's

510
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,559
taunting us we want to put a stop to

511
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,770
this we want to find his malware very

512
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,240
interesting that he's conducting

513
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,190
commander control over DNS you know

514
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,540
that's interesting we don't often see

515
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,990
that so what we want to do is find more

516
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,200
malware conducting commander control

517
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,660
over DNS so we'll set up various rules

518
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,030
will look for malware such as that we

519
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,520
know what it is what questions we want

520
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,950
to ask the data show me more malware

521
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,950
which is conducting research using DNS

522
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,520
and ultimately this brings us to this

523
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,620
document the one that I'll presented

524
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,500
that has the two macros in it here we

525
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,720
have a piece of malware which is

526
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,270
conducting command a control traffic

527
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,179
over DNS brilliant first question that

528
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:16,130
you want to ask well what is the the

529
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,970
server the IP address that is

530
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,400
communicating with so we find these IP

531
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,250
addresses and the first question that we

532
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,470
want our analysts to ask is well what

533
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,170
else is happening what what else is

534
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,080
going on and this is the point that we

535
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,280
have that

536
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,550
moment when we look in the passive DNS

537
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,780
and we actually see the web mail dot

538
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,700
governmental domain had been pointed at

539
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,100
one of the IP addresses that was being

540
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,010
used as command control so here we have

541
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,650
our evidence this is actually quite

542
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,170
significant there's been a deal has

543
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,750
probably been a DNS redirection attack

544
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,150
happening here something has clearly

545
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,730
gone wrong that we've had a legitimate a

546
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,460
very high reputation domain which

547
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,130
somehow is pointed at this IP address

548
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,250
which we know is being used as part of

549
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,570
the malicious campaign

550
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,780
so here again we want that to spark off

551
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,730
that reflection war what else is

552
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,220
happening you know what if what what

553
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,860
else is going on which leads us to look

554
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,590
into more detail and we find these range

555
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,610
of domains that are being redirected we

556
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,280
also identify again you know what else

557
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,020
might be happening what else might be we

558
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,900
were seeing and we find domain validated

559
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,780
entirely valid TLS certificates and

560
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,210
public registries that have been issued

561
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,520
for these domains where we've seen the

562
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,090
IP address changed maliciously at the

563
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,730
same time so clearly this looks very

564
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,650
very much like someone is doing some

565
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,020
kind of man-in-the-middle or certainly

566
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,650
an impersonation attack for us well the

567
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,540
first thing we want to do is we want to

568
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,310
share this we want people to be aware

569
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,400
that this is happening so we passed that

570
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,010
dissemination part of the of the process

571
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,070
we publish our findings with those

572
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,960
indicators are compromised in there and

573
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,150
what we like to think of happening is

574
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,920
across the world people are reading our

575
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,600
reports and a taking action and

576
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
certainly we we did see action coming

577
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,050
out of this we saw a lot of interest

578
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,180
within the press a lot of reports being

579
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,810
being written about it clearly lots of

580
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,450
other people were thinking about what it

581
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,040
is that we'd found and were looking at

582
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,110
their own systems and their own data for

583
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,770
more of this this led to the department

584
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,660
of homeland security in the u.s. issuing

585
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,510
this emergency directive you

586
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,220
agencies to audit their own DNS

587
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,170
information and for us this is this is

588
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,520
like really really interesting because

589
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,930
this is kind of suggesting that there's

590
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,350
more going on than we might initially be

591
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,540
seeing also the fact that we've been

592
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,340
very very open about this and saying

593
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,920
look we're seeing this led to further

594
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,100
intelligence coming to us and people

595
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,800
sharing information with us which

596
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,620
allowed us to then put together what was

597
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,580
the full picture of what was happening

598
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,690
identified that actually we had two

599
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,910
different DNS redirection campaigns

600
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,010
going on and this one with sea turtle

601
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,260
being conducted almost certainly by a

602
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,480
previously unknown nation-state threat

603
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,140
actor very very significant stuff we

604
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,600
look at about the steps that led us to

605
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,720
this it's actually mostly about

606
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,360
engagement well firstly we've got that

607
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,490
community engagement of someone tweeting

608
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,800
us a malware that they thought would

609
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,680
interest us okay that's great this is us

610
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,840
being part of the community we want

611
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,360
people to be part of the community and

612
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,660
to share things and to people to tell us

613
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,950
information that they think might be of

614
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,300
interest to us the fact that it had that

615
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,370
taunt very interesting observation

616
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,230
camarda control over DNS that's

617
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,510
interesting we want to find more of this

618
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,390
so we set up these automated processes

619
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,250
that are going out and looking for more

620
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,770
of this kind of malware which brings us

621
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:17,150
to this HR document this job recruiting

622
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,340
document that was conducting that

623
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,980
commander control over DNS and then

624
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,720
we've got that very very interesting

625
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,240
observation we've got a governmental

626
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,240
domain which is sharing DNS with this

627
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,410
malicious IP address that leads us to

628
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,970
reflect what what else might be

629
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,160
happening here how else might we find

630
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,650
more evidence of this attack within the

631
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,620
data we then publish it weekend we've

632
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,120
got that piece of community engagement

633
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,090
of people sharing information with us

634
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,070
which allows us to do more research

635
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,350
which allows us to identify the full

636
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,720
picture there

637
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,300
very very few tools in this there isn't

638
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,140
a seam in sight there is lots and lots

639
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,990
of engagement and actually little in the

640
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,330
way of tools this is mostly people being

641
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,730
people and communicating and being

642
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,710
innovative and having good ideas and

643
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,110
trying them out and wanting to get to

644
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,580
the bottom of the story so how do you go

645
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,480
about threat hunting and what advice can

646
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,960
I give you the first thing that people

647
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,720
tend to think of when we mentioned

648
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,200
threat hunting is it's dead easy you

649
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,090
just want a seam and then you go on the

650
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,770
dark web right I get a lot of this a

651
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,800
seam is a really good place to start at

652
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,630
least it makes you think about the data

653
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,540
that you might have how you might access

654
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,640
that and how you might visualize it the

655
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,730
great danger with the seam Solutions is

656
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,890
they're on Rails that they will show

657
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,400
your analysts only one view of what's

658
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,860
happening out there and actually make it

659
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,590
difficult to ask different and

660
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,080
innovative questions of the of the data

661
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,090
I had a very very good example of this

662
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,520
the other day I was talking to someone

663
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,710
who's wanted to start up a threat

664
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,100
hunting system and he wanted to know

665
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,430
what would an intrusion look like in his

666
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,890
network if somebody compromised the

667
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,890
laptops and so he went to his threat

668
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,600
hunting team what would this look like

669
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,230
if someone compromised a laptop how

670
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,240
would you find this and their response

671
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,820
was well the desktop protection would

672
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,490
flag and we see the light go off in our

673
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,320
in our scene and like guys know this is

674
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,460
not the way of doing it

675
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,640
what if it was a successful intrusion

676
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,670
that didn't trigger your desktop

677
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,200
protection what would that look like

678
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,120
these are the questions that you want to

679
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,250
ask that's how you're going to find the

680
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,610
new stuff as with the dark web yeah

681
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,350
there's all sorts of malicious activity

682
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,110
happening in the dark web again I talked

683
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,670
to someone a few weeks ago who's really

684
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,950
buzzing about researching in the in the

685
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,350
dark web and told me that yeah it was

686
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,789
absolutely what you need to do because

687
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:10,030
you can find the bad guys discussing the

688
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,710
denial of service attacks that they're

689
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,690
going to do on your network before they

690
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,320
happen

691
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,330
which is great and he's not wrong

692
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,179
however when you look at the the set of

693
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,330
things that actually happen and the

694
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,340
things that are discussed on the dark

695
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,830
web yeah some of the things that are

696
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,169
discussed on the dark web actually do go

697
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,559
on and happen but a lot of it yeah it

698
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,350
could just be noise just people

699
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,330
discussing things and what they're

700
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,870
discussing might not actually happen and

701
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,100
equally if they're talking about this

702
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,500
brand new super cyber weapon that

703
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,820
they've developed that they're going to

704
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,620
make for sale on the dark web yeah right

705
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,780
the threat actors that are actually

706
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,510
coming up with these new cyber weapons

707
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,179
wanna cry not mentioned on the dark web

708
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,460
not discussed on the dark dark web not

709
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,919
Pecha not discussed on the dark web sea

710
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,309
turtle not on the dark web so in fact

711
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,260
when we look at the things that you

712
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,799
actually need to worry about and concern

713
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,600
yourself about these are certainly the

714
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,299
things that I happen but that overlap

715
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:17,980
with the things that are happening on

716
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,260
the dark web might be smaller than you

717
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,299
think so

718
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,400
the first place that I'd start in terms

719
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,150
of that strategy is you know what is it

720
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,220
that you are hoping to find what would

721
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,890
you like to find in your environment and

722
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,049
then what would you do with this once

723
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:37,000
you've had once you've found it how will

724
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,150
that improve your security posture and

725
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,419
the goals of your organization another

726
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:45,970
question to ask are there actually

727
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,970
better things to do would you be better

728
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,700
off having a larger and better resource

729
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,390
team which is doing patching or sorting

730
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:00,070
out user authentication rather than

731
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,440
spending your time looking for advanced

732
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,870
threats within your within your network

733
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,360
it's a key question to start with threat

734
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,190
hunting isn't necessarily what it is

735
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,320
that you should be doing it's great if

736
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,240
you've got the maturity that you think

737
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,409
this is going to be a useful addition

738
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:15,340
but

739
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,649
may well be other things that you might

740
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,610
want to consider doing first keep it for

741
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,419
me is is the culture we want to enable

742
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:29,440
the team to hunt that will mean you will

743
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,049
have long long periods where nothing is

744
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,519
happening where you're finding nothing

745
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,340
when all your ideas are failing that is

746
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,870
actually a good sign

747
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,879
you need to encourage that you need to

748
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:42,399
keep people supported and motivated we

749
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,009
want lots of ideas we want to know that

750
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:46,840
it'll take a long time to find the bad

751
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,539
guys when we do find them it's probably

752
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,309
gonna take a long time to understand

753
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:53,200
what's actually happening this is a good

754
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,379
thing we don't want to build that

755
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:59,350
assembly line where we're very tightly

756
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,149
controlling what people are doing so

757
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:02,470
that we can measure it so that we can

758
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,999
report on it so that we know that

759
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:06,100
they're following procedures checklists

760
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,970
have their place but where we are in the

761
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,169
Internet at the moment we don't

762
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:12,700
necessarily know what those checklists

763
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,340
are we still in the discovery mode we

764
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,090
need to find out how we identify the bad

765
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,559
guys not necessarily following

766
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,700
prescribed wisdom that may have been

767
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,259
developed you know four or five years

768
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:28,360
ago great for finding the threats four

769
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,690
or five years ago not necessarily not

770
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,929
necessarily relevant now and then that

771
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,700
big piece it's all about human

772
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,649
connections getting people to work

773
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,720
together getting people to share ideas

774
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,440
share information working together to

775
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,399
solve the problem people key key key bit

776
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,149
we want a mix of both technical skills

777
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:54,570
people able to do malware analysis

778
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,860
software engineering skills so they can

779
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,320
write the tools or work the tools

780
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,330
differently and also data skills

781
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,950
thinking about the data that we've got

782
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,869
how do we model it how do we find what's

783
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:08,619
unusual how do we define unusual being

784
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:11,500
able to think of what questions we can

785
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,889
ask how might we be able to uncover the

786
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,639
unusual within the data that we have

787
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,260
and I think a lot of that really is

788
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,629
driven by curiosity I think the key

789
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:23,190
thing that we should be hiring for

790
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,379
within threat intelligence and threat

791
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,659
hunting is people who are really really

792
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,629
curious about things who like asking

793
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:33,059
difficult questions and really getting

794
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,289
to the root cause of what's going on

795
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:39,690
tools your sales guys will tell they

796
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,549
tell you this is the most important bit

797
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:44,429
no no not at all

798
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,069
it's all about what questions can I ask

799
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:50,190
the data and how easy is it to ask them

800
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,109
you do not need an all-singing

801
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:56,460
all-dancing data system to find things

802
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,549
quite the opposite you need easy ways to

803
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:02,220
ask questions of the data rather than

804
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,369
relying on a vendor showing you exactly

805
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,619
what they want you to see and only what

806
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,019
they want you to see and then that date

807
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:11,910
of it yeah you need some kind of data

808
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,000
often it's driven actually what can you

809
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,279
get access to and what is being

810
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:20,279
collected it's never going to be perfect

811
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:23,190
that's fine just accept what it is that

812
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,059
you can get doesn't have to be all

813
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:28,890
internal external source is a very very

814
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,140
good indeed and for goodness sake don't

815
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,559
store everything think about what data

816
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,130
would actually be useful to you and for

817
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,890
how long would that be useful in

818
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,990
restoring every single log within your

819
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,660
system for five years probably won't be

820
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,660
helpful to you but what happened

821
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,059
yesterday might be very very useful but

822
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:52,319
again think about the sort of

823
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,630
signal-to-noise ratio what might you be

824
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,569
able to find in the data that you have

825
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:59,579
access to and which you can actually

826
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,000
meaningfully store so to wrap it up I

827
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,740
mean really the key point if you want to

828
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,670
build a threat hunting team just empower

829
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,819
people to thread to hunt threads that's

830
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:12,269
it

831
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:14,279
you've become a threat hunter by hunting

832
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:15,960
threats and you do that and in an

833
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,849
environment that empowers people to get

834
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:19,619
on with it and do it and enjoy it and

835
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,289
get rewarded for it and with that I will

836
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,819
thank you very very much indeed for

837
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:25,220
listening to me and

838
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,320
both open up for questions now or also

839
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,670
if you want to come and chat to us on

840
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,470
the booth we'd be delighted to talk to

841
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,970
you in more detail thank you

842
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:48,260
Gordon Oh Michael's work okay yes hello

843
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,560
all the rain and where does attribution

844
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,600
attend all of this and if $1 is there

845
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,070
any value in it given that you can't

846
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,300
always actually work out

847
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,970
he really was behind it again you've got

848
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,310
I think it comes back to that initial

849
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,210
question how is this going to help you

850
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:09,030
the the example that I like to give even

851
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,620
though the pr2 people have told me not

852
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,030
to use it so Daniel have to close your

853
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:18,360
ears for a moment if you get mugged in a

854
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,990
dark alleyway does it matter if it's

855
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,390
hairy the heroin addict or Bob the crack

856
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,570
addicts who mugs you I think it's more

857
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,920
important not to get mugged and to

858
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,650
understand what it is that you need to

859
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,840
do in order for that not to happen again

860
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,720
rather than focusing on who was the

861
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,450
person that carried out the attack

862
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,050
certainly attribution has its place I

863
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,290
think it's useful to be able to cluster

864
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,750
together attacks and be able to look for

865
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,360
similarities between them because that

866
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,640
helps you think well if if two attacks

867
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,890
have some kind of commonality this would

868
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,620
be a very good thing to search on in the

869
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,640
future so knowing how attacks overlap

870
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,760
and those features that allow both allow

871
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,040
you to do attribution and also to to

872
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,190
aggregate together attacks are useful

873
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,410
knowing exactly who was behind it

874
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,110
personally I don't think actually gives

875
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,630
you that much information people tend to

876
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,320
be very very interested in it but again

877
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,670
it's that question what are you hoping

878
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,670
to achieve by this how with that

879
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,340
knowledge actually improve your security

880
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,110
posture or would you be in a better

881
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,120
position just focusing on how do I

882
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,120
protect and how I detect about this

883
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,610
better in the future so I know there're

884
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,170
that there are many people who disagree

885
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,490
with me and there are other teams that

886
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,350
that actually do focus on attribution

887
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,450
and if it is useful to you then then

888
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,150
great go for it my personal opinion is

889
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,010
actually I don't I think this helps a

890
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,870
lot less than most people think I'll get

891
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,570
be quick obviously you've got people

892
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,860
down there doing this threat hunting you

893
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,000
mentioned there about people want to be

894
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,900
first to find the threat tell us doing

895
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,520
it fireEye doing it CrowdStrike you're

896
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,260
doing it SecureWorks are doing it how

897
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,850
does that work then in terms you've got

898
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,050
all these those those four companies

899
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,310
they're probably many many more I've

900
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,110
forgotten how does it work in terms of

901
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,060
the people then trying to be first

902
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,700
against people doing the same thing for

903
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,940
another company I think it's mostly I

904
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,160
think it's incredibly helpful because it

905
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,470
comes a very very strong motivator in

906
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,570
order to want to find things first

907
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,400
because this is how careers are made

908
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,830
careers are made on finding the most

909
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,920
interesting things first so having that

910
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,680
little bit of pressure behind because

911
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,450
there's other people also looking for

912
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,610
VIP for this I think focus is the mind

913
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:51,660
enormous Lee and helps people focus on

914
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,120
what it is that we need to find how do

915
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,010
we get this information out as soon as

916
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,140
as soon as possible so that side is

917
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,930
great also we go back to this community

918
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,770
thing we share enormous lis within the

919
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,480
the community were founder members of

920
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,300
the cyber threat Alliance we're

921
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,430
proactively sharing information and

922
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,020
intelligence throughout the security

923
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,920
community those companies that are that

924
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,360
are seen as our competitors in a

925
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,790
commercial environment we're still part

926
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,370
of the security community and we are all

927
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,370
united against a common foe we united

928
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,930
against the bad guys that are out there

929
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,430
that are trying to undermine the

930
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,020
internet that are trying to undermine

931
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,270
the systems that the power in our lives

932
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,580
and allow us to function those are the

933
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,100
bad guys that is what our focus is on

934
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,610
and to be fair there's more than enough

935
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,130
malicious activity out there to go round

936
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,210
we are not hunting in a very very small

937
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,370
hunting reserve there is a lot of

938
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,930
activity there

939
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,549
but that's there to be found which i

940
00:40:53,549 --> 00:40:55,289
think is great because we can get more

941
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,260
people in there's lots of big game out

942
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,150
there that you can have come down and

943
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:08,789
find anyone else who wants place nope

944
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:12,349
Martin thank you very much thank you
