and basically um

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,159
currently yeah as i said i work as a

22
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,520
senior data scientist

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,720
uh from fortinet uh and

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
uh yeah my my main area of research

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,240
besides

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,400
uh insurance uh it's basically

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
differential privacy

28
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,600
and machine learning so um

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,799
just a little disclaimer uh you know

30
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,799
i've done this research on my own so

31
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,799
my employer which is fortnite currently

32
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,320
is not involved

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,040
and obviously doesn't reflect on any any

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
of

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
their views uh i don't work for any

36
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,040
insurance provider

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,680
so i'm sort of impartial to this

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,119
specific topic

39
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,758
but i do mentor a startup that does risk

40
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,360
insurance analytics for uh

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,599
for cyber insurance purposes and this is

42
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,440
how i basically got involved in

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,800
the in this kind of sector so um it's uh

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
it's kind of interesting space

45
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,200
um you know from a technical perspective

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,239
and uh

47
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,360
yeah this is why i got into it uh on

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
a part-time basis let's say that uh so

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
the agenda for today is

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
okay we're going to be late so we'll be

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,959
45 minutes

52
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,640
but yeah i'm going to start my timer

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
just in case i get

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
too slow um basically uh you know i'm

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,560
going to talk about

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,599
about cyber insurance um how

57
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,720
basically was developed over time the

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
business driver for for the actual

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
insurance um

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
kind of a little bit about the process

61
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,680
that drives uh

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,159
you can insurance market technical

63
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,440
challenges that

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
uh we are facing um and

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
you know a bit of stuff that we've seen

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
in news especially with the uh

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,519
pipeline ransomware attack and um stuff

68
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,080
like that

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
right um and then obviously run

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,879
somewhere in summary insurance which is

71
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,200
a

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,040
kind of a very hot topic um the gdpr

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
uh and cyber insurance which is

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
i guess more for the european people but

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
it's also relevant to u.s companies

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,959
and basically how the attack review you

77
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,040
know certain insurance how they leverage

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
that and then

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
a little bit of some predictions there

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
uh so i think it's kind of probably most

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000
people know about cyber insurance but

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,920
it's like any other insurance i guess um

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,599
it's basically a product that

84
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
you know if you have a business you can

85
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
use to protect

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
[Music]

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
typically was developed for basically

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
internet based release but

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,680
you know it it doesn't have to be coming

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,879
from the internet

91
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,519
uh but yeah you know in general just any

92
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,799
anything related to information

93
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,599
technology

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,120
um infrastructure activities um

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,159
there are you know like this kind of you

96
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,200
know if you look at traditional

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,280
insurance those kind of liabilities are

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,319
usually

99
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,760
excluded from those products so that's

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,918
why you have to buy specifically

101
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,759
several insurance um there are

102
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,079
essentially two type of coverage broadly

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
speaking is the kind of

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
first party cyber coverage which you can

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
see in the

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,800
blue color there you know the dark color

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,600
uh

108
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
you know you can read these later but

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
you know anything related to uh you know

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,479
business interruption

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,160
uh cost and um uh you know recovering

112
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,479
from

113
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,360
incidents rebuilding your backups you

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
know restoring your backups

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
you know cyber extortion recently uh

116
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,560
with ransomware

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
um you know notifications uh

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,639
investigation for privacy

119
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,440
anything that basically um it's related

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,080
to the business

121
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
right in terms of cost um for the third

122
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,520
party

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,840
coverage it's related to uh essentially

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,639
regulation

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,520
most of the time uh you know media sort

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,479
of reputation

127
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
essentially releasing statements and um

128
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,479
you know for

129
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,120
you know anything related to uh data

130
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,680
breach

131
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,479
uh even slander and those kind of nice

132
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,039
things

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,080
uh um and you know privacy

134
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,720
and so on so that's that's the kind of

135
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,360
two main

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
sort of uh you know sections that you

137
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,600
have to look when you buy some insurance

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,160
you know

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
what does it cover in terms of third

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,520
party and third party insurance

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
um in terms of uh maturity like

142
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,440
most people think you know sovereignty

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,960
is new but actually

144
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
uh you know we can track it back to the

145
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,080
90s

146
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,880
uh you know originally it was mostly to

147
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,600
cover

148
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
uh uh you know like uh century

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,759
essentially random errors and the

150
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,720
missions

151
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,199
uh yeah so the main buyers were like

152
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,960
professional service firms and

153
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,000
technology um you know

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
in the early thousands the coverage was

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,199
for bridges but

156
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,840
uh no first party coverage and a lot of

157
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
exclusions so he you know

158
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
he was kind of new i guess it was the

159
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,960
kind of you know

160
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
sort of uh inception of uh like you know

161
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
modern cyber insurance

162
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
uh and main buyers were basically

163
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,319
healthcare and retail

164
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,639
and yeah the uptake was kind of slow and

165
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,759
then you know

166
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
we move a little bit to the uh you know

167
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,120
mid 2000s

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,759
um coverage was added for first party

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,120
including business interruption

170
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
extortions

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,280
uh network asset damage uh and

172
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,520
uh you know there was essentially

173
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,000
coverage for privacy online and offline

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
and more sort of people were buying that

175
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
more customers were buying that you know

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,960
retail healthcare

177
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,759
and finance financial institutions um

178
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,319
which

179
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,080
you know guess what were including some

180
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
significant uh principal information

181
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,400
uh and then you know

182
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,000
there was uh you know if our compliance

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
uh kicked in

184
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
and then so they have to add that too uh

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
but currently you can

186
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,599
pretty much have a sub insurance for um

187
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,240
almost

188
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,160
any kind of uh first part in third party

189
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
um coverage so there is basically you

190
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,240
can have a full coverage

191
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,720
but uh in theory you can have a full

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,360
coverage

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
uh for almost everything but we will see

194
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
why that's not always the case

195
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,800
um in terms of main buyers but

196
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
there is basically almost every every

197
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
industry now is buying it from

198
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,599
manufacturers to energy and

199
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,120
transportation including the uh the

200
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
previous ones

201
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,120
um and like you know why these why this

202
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
update well

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,080
uh you know if you look at the uh kind

204
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
of uh in terms of commercial activities

205
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,840
like you know the first one that was

206
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
available was in the 1998 from

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,919
uh icsa through secure uh

208
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,160
he had a you know a first party coverage

209
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
of twenty thousand dollars per incident

210
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,440
uh and a maximum 250 000 per year

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
uh you know uh i guess if you're

212
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,520
factoring for inflation it's it's much

213
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,199
more nowadays but

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,960
you know if you look at you know over

215
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,639
time uh you know up to

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
you know 2000 with aig you can get

217
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
you know first and third party coverage

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
for 25 millions now so

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,000
so you know it's basically

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,319
it's it's i guess with any other type of

221
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,360
other insurance

222
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
markets you know like there's a growing

223
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,639
need to satisfy

224
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,520
and you know the kind of coverage has

225
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
increased over time

226
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,919
and it's kind of interesting when you

227
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,599
look at these companies i guess i don't

228
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,279
want to spend too much time on that

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,919
um how they uh sort of partner into each

230
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,719
other

231
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,360
uh you know in 1998 there was cisco

232
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,799
systems and um

233
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,399
you know a few other companies that were

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,160
basically selling some sort of

235
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
uh insurance which uh was kind of

236
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
interesting and you know some other

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,320
companies

238
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,360
i don't know if they're still in

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
business like the word scale

240
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,560
underwriting

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,760
uh i don't know if they changed to some

242
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,000
other sort of branding uh brand or

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
but you know ibm was the other one that

244
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,120
was a yeah

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
kind of a pioneer of survey insurance in

246
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
1998 we were already selling that so

247
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,160
it's kind of interesting to see that

248
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
but you know if you look at the kind of

249
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
update because the insurance is very

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,000
much

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
correlated from uh what we have seen in

252
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
terms of internet forms right so

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
in the 2000 there is the allow view with

254
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,160
an estimated

255
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,800
cost worldwide of 15 billion dollars

256
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
then there was code red

257
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,440
in 2001 uh nimdah clans you know how

258
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
many people remember that there was a

259
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
slumber war

260
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
uh and then you know fast forward uh you

261
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
know sorry my doom um

262
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
stormwarm configure uh stuxnet uh which

263
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
wasn't really

264
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,399
um you know designed to disrupt uh

265
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,640
those uh general public but you know we

266
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
know we it was target for

267
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,959
it was a targeted for uh iranian

268
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,720
richmond plans but you know

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
it was infecting a lot of uh a lot of

270
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,560
end points

271
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
uh and then to the recent one like

272
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,000
wannacry not paddy i think everybody

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
knows about those two um

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,839
uh worms you know with 4 billion and

275
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,720
billions of uh damages in total so

276
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
uh so yeah so the main driver is

277
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,079
obviously the uh

278
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,360
the cyber crime right so like how uh the

279
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
internet has developed and

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
uh basically facilitating all this kind

281
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,279
of you know frat vectors like that we

282
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,079
have seen

283
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,320
uh and uh you know i was a contractor in

284
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,600
2000 before that

285
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,560
you know i was uh doing basically like

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,120
uh

287
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,920
just partner a part-time consultant for

288
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,040
recovering from

289
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
uh warms and viruses and i do remember

290
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
the dialogue

291
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,279
incident uh which was kind of uh kind of

292
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,560
interesting at the time right it was

293
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,680
probably one of the

294
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,959
major ones and um you know

295
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,800
it was quite simple if you think about

296
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,440
it now but at the time it was

297
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,839
new and everybody was uh you know caught

298
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,680
off guard by that so um

299
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,399
uh so there will be more in the future

300
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,240
i'm guessing right so

301
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
uh and the other obviously the other

302
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
push of uh you know for the uptake of

303
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
cyber insurance is obviously uh

304
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
regulation right so we

305
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
uh you know in 1986 there was the

306
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,760
computer for the

307
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,480
abuse act in the u.s then there was the

308
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
dot com boom you know everybody was

309
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
moving online uh in 1996 there was the

310
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,160
uh

311
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
hippa hacked uh which it's quite

312
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,480
incredible if you think about it

313
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,360
nowadays

314
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
if you look uh if you look at the uh you

315
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,959
know in terms of

316
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,160
industry uh verticals it's probably

317
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
you know the afghan is the one that is

318
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
uh like one of the major

319
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
targets of cyber crime if you look at

320
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,320
the polymon reports or the uh

321
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,399
verizon report from you know for a

322
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,000
couple of years ago until now

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
uh healthcare is what you know basically

324
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
always on the top right so it was kind

325
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,079
of

326
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,200
interesting um that people have already

327
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
thought about that in 1996 so that was

328
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,839
kind of a nice piece of legislation then

329
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
there was the uh

330
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,600
uh gl ba act um europe you know to be

331
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,519
slower so we uh we take some time to

332
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,560
learn from from the us

333
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,480
but you know there was a council of

334
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,839
cyber crime

335
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
treaty uh in 2000 uh 2002 the

336
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,240
serpentis oxley act and then there was

337
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,560
the you know california state law

338
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,360
2003 there was a kick about focusing on

339
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
pii and cost

340
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
um that we know that there was the

341
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,279
presidential directive 54.

342
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,839
uh eu again was following with the nis

343
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,560
directive

344
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,079
and then you know if you fast forward

345
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
now we are basically gdpr

346
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,600
from 2018 and 2020 we have the basically

347
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,880
ccpa

348
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
uh came into force which is basically

349
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,079
kind of the equivalent european

350
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,519
equivalent of uh of the gdpr so

351
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,519
you know obviously this is kind of uh

352
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,120
it's kind of a

353
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
you know basically uh when you look at

354
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,399
liabilities and

355
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,800
fines uh you know you do want to have

356
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,880
some sort of coverage for that and

357
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,079
which is also actually not a good thing

358
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,120
but i will talk about that later uh so

359
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,839
the business of

360
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,839
study insurance what uh how does that

361
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,760
work right um

362
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,480
you know you have been sure and insured

363
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
actually is more complicated than that

364
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,519
it's uh but i'm trying to simplify that

365
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,079
so

366
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,959
so the insurance um wants to seek to

367
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,560
capture profits from premiums

368
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,040
uh exciting uh exceeding losses over

369
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,760
time

370
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,120
but it's basically spreading uh risk uh

371
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
of you know certain events that you know

372
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,880
we can't really uh predict accurately

373
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,079
uh that possibly are uncorrelated

374
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,440
between clients right so you're

375
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,920
basically

376
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,440
kind of making a profit on uh on the

377
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,760
losses of your of your customers

378
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,880
assuming that you can

379
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,440
measure risk very well and the insurance

380
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,360
the insured is basically uh

381
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
somebody that seeks to maximize their

382
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,600
utility or profit by managing

383
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,079
the risk uh and certain loss events that

384
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
they basically uh offset to the insurer

385
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,199
right so

386
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,440
it's especially risk transfer it's at

387
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,399
the end of the day is basically

388
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,320
transferring risk from one party

389
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
to the other one um and so once again

390
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,519
that right like so

391
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
like um you know the game there is

392
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,320
basically to try to

393
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,680
measure risk as accurately as you can uh

394
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
because if you set your premiums why

395
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
obviously

396
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360
we are in a free market at least in uh

397
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
most democratic

398
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
countries uh which means if your

399
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,240
primaries are twice somebody else will

400
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,600
capture their profit

401
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
their margin right so they are going to

402
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,800
basically um

403
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,079
you know compete and all offer low

404
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,160
low premiums uh basically stealing your

405
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,440
customers

406
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,279
but on the other side if you price your

407
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,199
insurance your premium is too low

408
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,519
um and you have losses you basically

409
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,440
might go bankrupt right so

410
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,399
um so it is you know it is kind of a

411
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,760
challenge and it's it's

412
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,720
very much like an information uh theory

413
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,079
problem right it's uh

414
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,000
that's why you have a lot of actuarial

415
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,519
people trying to guess

416
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,320
uh risk and uh basically measure that

417
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,040
right

418
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,519
and the most important metric from

419
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,399
insurance

420
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,959
uh perspective is the combined ratio so

421
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,399
like obviously you have the premiums

422
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:04,959
that

423
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,600
brings cash in uh but then you also have

424
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
your loss ratio

425
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,040
um there are kind of various problems in

426
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,440
the

427
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,000
cyber insurance uh nowadays uh you know

428
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,839
i would call these like minor issues

429
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,760
uh one is basically adversarial

430
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,959
selection where

431
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,279
there is an informational symmetry where

432
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,000
basically

433
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,320
uh you know the sub insurance needs to

434
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
try to gas

435
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,880
uh the let's say maturity

436
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,480
of the company right because uh you know

437
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
you want to give a low premium like low

438
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,519
coverage contract to uh to a company

439
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:39,839
that

440
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,880
is uh probably uh too risky or or high

441
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,199
premium high coverage contract to uh to

442
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,360
a company that is less risky right

443
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,279
um and the problem is that obviously

444
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,560
there are companies that

445
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,440
try to pretend to be less risky right so

446
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
they want to have a lower premium

447
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,000
uh and essentially what happens with

448
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,320
this kind of uh

449
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
within this problem is that you you tend

450
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
to uh

451
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,480
to have what is called like a welfare

452
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
loss where

453
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,240
essentially you have smaller companies

454
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,800
are

455
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,240
probably on average underinsured and the

456
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
the bigger companies

457
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,720
uh are you know a pretty good insurance

458
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
policy so you sort of you know to reach

459
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,240
the market equilibrium

460
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
basically penalizing the smaller players

461
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,240
um

462
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,199
there's nothing really uh new about this

463
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:29,920
you know this is

464
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,240
uh very common in other industries and

465
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
maybe it's going to be more in sub

466
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,880
insurance because

467
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
uh you know people don't know how to

468
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,199
measure risk yet but you know there are

469
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,959
other tools and things that

470
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,720
companies are doing to uh to measure

471
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,000
that uh

472
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,160
there's probably more hazard where

473
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
basically uh

474
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
you know when you have coverage you are

475
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
a little bit more uh let's say relaxed

476
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,959
uh so you might basically click on any

477
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,160
any

478
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,440
any spam link you get and uh uh

479
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
and you know you're just relying on

480
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,600
server insurance to uh

481
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,439
your insurance provider to basically fix

482
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,439
uh whatever incidents you have

483
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,919
uh but you know to solve that basically

484
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,599
you know insurance providers are

485
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,959
you know uh pretty um pretty uh clever

486
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,799
so they will put exclusions in place so

487
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,280
that

488
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,959
if for example um you had a let's say a

489
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,880
bridge or something they say well

490
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,039
you know you don't have backups uh you

491
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
know you clicked on a phishing link that

492
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,640
was marked as

493
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
fish from your uh i don't know uh aav

494
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,320
uh so you know i'm not going to call it

495
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
for for that right because you know you

496
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,960
didn't

497
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,480
practice uh you know very basic cyber

498
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,919
aging procedures so

499
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,200
uh sorry so i mean it is a problem but

500
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,320
you have to be careful when you buy

501
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,440
yourself insurance there are a lot of

502
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,000
exclusions to uh to provide for them

503
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
and then there's externalities right so

504
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
there are obviously all the computers

505
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,480
are connected

506
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,520
uh you know if there's a power failure

507
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,840
or uh or a telecom failure like the

508
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,520
communication failure

509
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
you know you might be able unable to

510
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,640
perform your

511
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,520
business functions uh you know if there

512
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,760
was a hurricane katrina

513
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
destroys your power line you know the

514
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,799
computers goes off and

515
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,320
you know backup power only lasts for a

516
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,640
few hours uh so all those things

517
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,000
typically you will cover that with

518
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
another insurance policy right because

519
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,720
you can't

520
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
factor in all these possible um

521
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,320
situations right

522
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
but there are also things like act of

523
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,520
cyber war that

524
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,960
was unfortunately uh meant well

525
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,600
this actually happened uh in a specific

526
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,160
case but

527
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,760
you can basically say well you know this

528
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,400
was uh impossible to predict it was very

529
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
sophisticated so we don't cover for that

530
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,840
um so major issues are like what

531
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,880
you know it's basically uh like one of

532
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,760
the four

533
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,160
pain points that we have nowadays risk

534
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
prediction

535
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,400
um and i put some quotes there but

536
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,960
you know in other seg you know another

537
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,799
cyber insurance uh so in other

538
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,200
insurance sectors you can basically have

539
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
a pretty much good idea of um

540
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,760
you know like uh when when a building is

541
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,120
going to burn down

542
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
uh in manhattan or uh there's going to

543
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,960
be a hurricane or something like that

544
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,280
but

545
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
uh you know it's very hard to guess uh

546
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,600
you know if a specific castle will be

547
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
act tomorrow

548
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,840
um there is data collection so

549
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
you know if you get policies for

550
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,039
personal car or

551
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360
homework insurance you know you

552
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,280
definitely have a lot of good data but

553
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,000
it's cyber insurance there is pretty

554
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,039
much nothing right

555
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,640
that it's disclosed publicly um

556
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,559
you have catastrophic modeling so

557
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,919
basically um

558
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,760
you know what is going to work well is

559
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
there going to be a next patient or

560
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,559
wannacry and how much is going to be big

561
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,200
and

562
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,440
you know how many companies or uh you

563
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,520
know sectors is going to affect

564
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,919
and last but not least uh forensic

565
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,720
analysis

566
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,120
um yeah so there's not really a standard

567
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
from the insurance side to basically

568
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
follow a specific protocol

569
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,159
uh for basically doing forensic analysis

570
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,200
you can report you know

571
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,960
on an incident right so so each

572
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,320
contractor will do

573
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,080
we follow a different process maybe they

574
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,360
will follow the list 863

575
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,559
um you know framework or anything like

576
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,000
that but there's no really like

577
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,159
a manual of standardized procedures to

578
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:24,799
provide

579
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,840
uh analysis to uh to insurance uh

580
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
and also like you know customers if

581
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,360
they're malicious

582
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,679
they might also pretend to be hacked um

583
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,720
you know to uh

584
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,520
to cash in some some money and so how do

585
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,799
you you know how do you know that

586
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,919
um that that bridge was uh

587
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,799
you know was a result of uh collusion

588
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,400
with the uh you know with another

589
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,200
company

590
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
or you know saber kimo right so yeah

591
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
it's very hard to uh

592
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
you know they have to tell that right

593
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,720
you know like obviously it

594
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
should really open uh happen really

595
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,880
often but uh but it is a possibility

596
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,520
that uh

597
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,280
you know nobody is with that person

598
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,039
today

599
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,600
uh so if we talk if we look at the kind

600
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,480
of um

601
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
you know profitability and loss ratios

602
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,400
for uh conservative insurance uh this

603
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,919
was basically um

604
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,919
this is coming from uh from market

605
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,320
update from aeon

606
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,360
you know up to 2020 um

607
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,159
and you can see that essentially like in

608
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,760
terms of losses

609
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,400
uh from 2005 uh to the 15 to 2019 where

610
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,440
you know it was basically the uh yeah

611
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
ransomware

612
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,720
uh you know it didn't really impact them

613
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
uh pretty much uh

614
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,960
so it's sort of over in between you know

615
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
like 50

616
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,679
to like you know 47 right um

617
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,960
but you know there was an increase

618
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,919
between 2018 and 2019 you can see that

619
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,240
in

620
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,600
those bars um and like

621
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,840
what was different was as you can see in

622
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,120
the text that

623
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,159
it was more like a jumping frequency

624
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,000
right rather than the

625
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,799
sort of uh claim size right because you

626
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,240
know there's two things that drives

627
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,320
these losses is like how many claims do

628
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,559
you get but what's the kind of value of

629
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,640
each claim right um

630
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,320
and yes you can you can look at this

631
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,760
later but um but

632
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
yeah so like you know like you are

633
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,880
thinking

634
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,320
uh well what's what's 47 percent like is

635
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,159
it a good number for them

636
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,960
you know how does it compare to uh you

637
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,640
know to other to other industries right

638
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,919
so

639
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,000
just to give you an idea you know like

640
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
in property uh

641
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,480
uh you know it's kind of frequent to

642
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,120
have a

643
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,520
one billion loss per event so if you

644
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,320
look at us and canada from 2008

645
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,799
uh until now pretty much there were like

646
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,520
57 big events like that right so

647
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,679
and hurricane katrina uh which was the

648
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,640
biggest global

649
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,679
uh insurance loss in history was 160

650
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,280
billion dollars right so

651
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,640
so that's the kind of size we are

652
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
talking from from like a physical

653
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,600
uh physical insurance you know type of

654
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,240
insurance

655
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
um but you know if you look at patia or

656
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,760
not patia

657
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,080
the estimated loss in 2017 was three

658
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
billions right

659
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,000
the american core uh that was the

660
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,360
pharmaceutical company

661
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,200
had a 1.75 billion cyber loss and 250

662
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,840
million

663
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,120
affirmative losses so you know if you

664
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,000
look at those two

665
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
it's uh you know relatively speaking

666
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,280
it's not that big right

667
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,960
compared to other insurance markets and

668
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,039
uh you know if you look at wannacry

669
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,520
uh the estimated losses were you know

670
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,039
sort of four billion

671
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,760
and you know in the uk wannacry goes to

672
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,320
our

673
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,600
uh you know national uh national health

674
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,880
um system about 94 million so

675
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,480
you know they're kind of small you know

676
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,919
they're you know they're not that big

677
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,120
uh and then so like but uh you know

678
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
okay so you know i give you those

679
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,600
numbers but you know you you have to

680
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,480
consider you can

681
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,159
combine loss right so if you look at

682
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
that uh and

683
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,240
if you want to choose like uh an

684
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,880
insurance

685
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
sector you definitely don't want to be

686
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,960
in private car insurance uh

687
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,840
you can see that for 2019 the combined

688
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,720
loss was like 98.8

689
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,400
right so that's quite high um

690
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,360
you know home insurance 97 percent uh

691
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,600
private equity insurance 97 percent as

692
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:23,919
well

693
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,000
very similar to home insurance uh

694
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,360
property and casualty

695
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,640
combined it's 98 so

696
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,799
we even when you factor in the kind of

697
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,320
total uh

698
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,880
expense ratio for for sub insurance

699
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,840
right

700
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,880
you are still pretty much in a

701
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,120
you know maybe 10 percent lower than the

702
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,400
other sectors right you know you're

703
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,919
basically 74

704
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,320
you know for uh for 2019 compared to all

705
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,919
these other sectors so

706
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,520
so it's pretty good yeah so it's pretty

707
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,760
good profit for them right so

708
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,240
so everybody's into uh cyber insurance

709
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,919
is the you know if you uh you know if

710
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,960
you want to go

711
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,880
in insurance go to slavery insurance

712
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,720
it's where you make most of your money

713
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,760
now

714
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,360
um but one of the biggest problems with

715
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
basically ransomware

716
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,640
uh you know since uh you know basically

717
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,880
2015

718
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,640
but up to now is that uh essentially

719
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
uh the insurance providers are financing

720
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,080
cyber payments right

721
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,840
um and because of that obviously the uh

722
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
the insurance market

723
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,480
you see workforce has increased rapidly

724
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
right so

725
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,240
uh so you know like according to these

726
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,799
stats

727
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,279
basically the uh the premiums uh

728
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,159
increase

729
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,559
basically doubled to uh 3.1 billions

730
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,279
right

731
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,919
um and fortunately there are a lot of

732
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,720
companies that

733
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
even though they had um they tried not

734
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
to pay

735
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,240
ransom were instructed by the sub

736
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,320
insurance provider to do so

737
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,760
and the reason it's kind of very of

738
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,159
obvious uh uh you know if the cost of

739
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,679
the round somewhere

740
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,480
of the actual ransom is low is less than

741
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,240
the actual cost of recovery

742
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,400
uh then the insurance product will say

743
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,600
well you know what

744
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,039
let's pay that right because it will

745
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,279
take you you know longer time to recover

746
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,640
your business we are going to pay all

747
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,159
your business interruption costs you

748
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,919
have to get forensic involved you have

749
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,559
to get

750
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,720
you know all those kind of other uh

751
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
professionals to uh to be able to

752
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,240
you know eradicate and basically uh

753
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
restore your business let's just be the

754
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,840
ransom like that's the kind of most

755
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,640
logical

756
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,000
uh decision there right um

757
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,039
and uh well you know as i see as as you

758
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,320
can guess this is not

759
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
well this creates a positive feedback

760
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
where basically uh ransomware

761
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,400
criminals cyber criminals get more money

762
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,440
and they can basically

763
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,720
get more sophisticated and and do more

764
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,120
of that

765
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,960
right and if you look at the average on

766
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
some payment for

767
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,960
from companies like cover where uh you

768
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,039
know it's about thirty six thousand

769
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,240
dollars um in the last uh report

770
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
uh and you know it basically went up six

771
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,400
times from from the last uh from last

772
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
october so um

773
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,159
uh so yeah so you know insurance

774
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,720
companies are approving uh ransomware

775
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,840
payments so

776
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,279
and there's a lot of evidence of that

777
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,720
um so yeah i mean like uh

778
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,799
ransomware attacks they're quite common

779
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,000
now so you know

780
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,279
as a result of that 2019 uh you know

781
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,360
like losses were spread across companies

782
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,320
of all sizes

783
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,679
uh especially the commercial segment

784
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,159
and uh yes i say they were still making

785
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,200
despite of that

786
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,000
uh insurance companies were still making

787
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,039
quite quite good money

788
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,159
uh of 2019. um

789
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,880
in the first half of 2020 so like last

790
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,360
year

791
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,279
uh you know basic answer attacks

792
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,200
accounted for 41 percent

793
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,760
of the total number of uh subway issue

794
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,799
on claims so

795
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,880
so that's kind of a lot and you know if

796
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
you want to do some cheap statistics you

797
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,159
can basically say that

798
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,399
a business would fall victim of a ransom

799
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,360
attack every 14 seconds

800
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,039
and yeah so this is basically where

801
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,840
the kind of insurance companies realize

802
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,220
that

803
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,919
[Music]

804
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,279
i guess they could be you know like it's

805
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,799
it's good for business but

806
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,760
obviously you know it comes to a point

807
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,080
where

808
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,399
it's not sustainable anymore right so uh

809
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,279
so

810
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,720
you know they were basically kind of

811
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,640
predicting that well 2020 this is going

812
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,159
to get war so we have to do something

813
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,600
about that right so

814
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,480
uh we can't just keep paying that but uh

815
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,960
but

816
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
we'll see uh you know what kind of

817
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,960
things they're trying to do to mitigate

818
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,919
that so

819
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,960
um so like you know like what do you do

820
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,399
like do you pay or

821
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,200
not pay a ransom like you know it's to

822
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,159
me it's kind of

823
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,320
obvious decision like uh okay if you pay

824
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,679
the ransom you can

825
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,080
have a fast recruit recovery time

826
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,440
assuming you have a

827
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,039
uh sorry yeah if you don't pay the

828
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,720
ransom but you're good uh

829
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,440
it's a response plan obviously maybe you

830
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,480
can go back with

831
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,559
a couple of days but uh you know if you

832
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,919
pay that obviously

833
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,120
you're going to find criminals you have

834
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,799
going to have increased premiums and

835
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,720
you're also going to include loss of

836
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
reputation right so

837
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,399
um and there was a kind of an

838
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,279
interesting story

839
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,480
story from my own uh country where um

840
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,559
uh in italy like between the 70s and 80s

841
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,120
um

842
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,679
there were you know people were being

843
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,480
kidnapped

844
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,880
for economical reasons so they were

845
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
kidnapped people and asked for a ransom

846
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,320
um university was the seventh uh 1977

847
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,960
when there were

848
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,000
70 uh people and yeah they were in

849
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,480
three key regions uh where these kind of

850
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,919
criminals were

851
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,960
performing this kind of uh

852
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,640
you know activities and they were not

853
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,320
just mafia right you would think that's

854
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
probably just uh

855
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,120
you know the usual market doing that but

856
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,360
they were like people you know groups

857
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,039
formed specifically for this kind of

858
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,520
activity so how did he stop right i mean

859
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,120
after a few years like we didn't know

860
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,679
anything about that um

861
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,000
so you know in the original penal code

862
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,279
please no jokes

863
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,520
uh the jail time originally was between

864
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,799
eight and fifteen years

865
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,320
uh they had to put a new law uh you know

866
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,440
for 497 497

867
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,559
that increased uh basically from from 10

868
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,120
uh you know from 8 to 15 to 10 to 20

869
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,880
years uh in jail

870
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,480
and there were you know additional law

871
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,760
that the government had released

872
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,840
specifically for that right so you know

873
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,559
there was a

874
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,640
additional penalties penalties if you

875
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
were actually going to kill the person

876
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,520
uh and i i i think the most important

877
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,080
law that was passed was in 1991

878
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,039
uh which basically allowed the uh police

879
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,679
uh

880
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,080
uh or the basically law enforcement to

881
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,799
actually stop

882
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,880
payments right they didn't allow you to

883
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,000
you know even if you had money they

884
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,679
would basically freeze your bank account

885
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,440
so you couldn't pay the actual criminals

886
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,760
right

887
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,320
but assuming the police became aware of

888
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
that and obviously if you

889
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,440
you know if you didn't do anything then

890
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,880
they couldn't stop that

891
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,799
uh so this is kind of a good lesson

892
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,960
right like that we can basically almost

893
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,080
transfer to uh

894
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,360
to uh you know to ransomware right

895
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,000
uh and well the other problem is

896
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,919
obviously you know i'm not against creep

897
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,720
crypto like i don't invest or trading

898
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,440
crypto

899
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,159
but like the main reason why criminals

900
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:14,559
uh

901
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,880
are using these kind of strategies that

902
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,279
it's very easy to

903
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,600
to basically get paid and uh launder

904
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
money uh from crypto right

905
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,880
uh so so like you know if you look at

906
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,840
the kind of

907
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
uh you know percentage share of crypto

908
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,120
payments

909
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,360
uh ready to run somewhere okay it's not

910
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,480
that much right

911
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,919
it's uh you know before 2009 before

912
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,640
kind of the 19 was about you know less

913
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,399
than one percent you know it went up to

914
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,279
two percent

915
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,480
uh and then it's going uh back down

916
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,200
2020 so people have stopped paying uh

917
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,399
you know ransomware

918
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,720
uh but you know it is it is especially

919
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,519
the uh

920
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,200
one of the main vectors to to get paid

921
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
right there's nothing i mean i never

922
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,360
heard of a

923
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
ransomware attack where like the

924
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,399
attacker said

925
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,039
put cash into a bank account or uh you

926
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,640
know bring it back full of cash

927
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,840
at this location right uh it's it's

928
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,679
very hard to do that because obviously

929
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,360
law enforcement can track you they can

930
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,880
track your bank transaction

931
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,320
it's also very expensive to have an

932
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
offshore company somewhere to basically

933
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
move money quickly between between that

934
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,440
so

935
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,279
uh so it is you know like you know

936
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,640
crypto is a factor

937
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,799
uh that allows cyber criminals to do

938
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,799
that right so if there was no crypto

939
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,960
i don't believe we would seem that we

940
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,799
will see this kind of attacks right

941
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,279
um and i mean if you look at other

942
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,200
obviously other sort of

943
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
uh sources of income from cyber

944
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,600
criminals obviously scam is the largest

945
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,320
share

946
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,519
of cryptocurrency uh transactions so i'm

947
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,960
just checking my time yeah uh

948
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,720
in the colonial pipeline example it was

949
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,640
in the news uh 7 may they were attacked

950
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,840
8th of june uh basically currently

951
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,880
partly

952
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,080
paste dark side um we i can't really

953
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,799
tell if the

954
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,679
insurance that they have uh which uh is

955
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,000
uh

956
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,480
the broker is aeon and is a mix of loads

957
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,240
of london axe and beasley

958
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,919
and they had a car for last 15 minutes

959
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,919
so insurance could have paid for that

960
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,440
but we don't know right they didn't

961
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,360
publish that kind of information

962
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,399
uh but funny enough for like basically

963
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,679
after a few days

964
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,240
they paid the fbi managed to get a

965
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,320
subpoena for the uh for the crypto

966
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,440
wallet where

967
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,000
the payment was received and they

968
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,600
managed to uh to send back

969
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,320
well money to another wallet so um so

970
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
that was kind of interesting like the uh

971
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,440
i guess the criminals uh were

972
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
sort of afraid of moving money from from

973
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,480
that wallet

974
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,559
i don't really know why they took money

975
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,640
outside of that wallet so

976
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,799
maybe it was a timing issue i don't know

977
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,840
but in this case

978
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,919
obviously you know the client paid and

979
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,200
the fbi managed to

980
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,559
recover that so um so that's kind of a

981
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,320
kind of a first time like i never seen

982
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,840
anything like that so probably

983
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,559
one of the first uh times uh the fbi has

984
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,159
stepped in to recover

985
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,960
bitcoins uh from a ransomware payment so

986
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,440
um

987
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
so yeah that was kind of interesting one

988
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,280
and in terms of business impact people

989
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,800
think like oh this was like

990
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
very complicated actually what happened

991
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
they were basically uh

992
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,719
attacking their billing system that was

993
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,639
went down and because of that

994
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,879
they couldn't basically sell their their

995
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,159
gas to other

996
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,960
to their customers so um so yeah the

997
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,800
building system essentially blocked the

998
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,359
actual

999
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,199
uh uh you know transfer of uh of funds

1000
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,159
well basically

1001
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,639
allow the company to conduct their

1002
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,239
business so

1003
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,639
so that was kind of an interesting uh

1004
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,679
twist uh

1005
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,839
jbs another example the meat producer

1006
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,440
they actually produce a quarter of the

1007
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,239
entire meat

1008
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,879
uh in u.s which is which is scary it's a

1009
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,399
brazilian company

1010
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,480
seven june they go hacked uh they had to

1011
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,918
shut down four factories

1012
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,359
uh for facilities uh and the 10th of

1013
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,879
june that was a couple of days ago

1014
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,760
they basically paid 11 million um to the

1015
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,240
uh

1016
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,599
you know the legal group right um

1017
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,680
i don't know what is going to happen uh

1018
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,640
the fbi is

1019
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
are they going to try to do the same

1020
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,800
thing uh maybe i'm not sure like

1021
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,440
maybe the uh criminals and mommy already

1022
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,240
um

1023
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
i can't find any information about the

1024
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,320
sub insurance so i don't know

1025
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,800
like what kind of insurance police they

1026
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,040
have and if the insurance is paid but

1027
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,839
but they didn't manage to restore from

1028
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,680
their backup

1029
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,560
but what they said was that despite

1030
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,119
their

1031
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,480
uh you know irp and uh you know

1032
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,800
uh pro you know stock and procedures and

1033
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,599
whatever

1034
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,240
uh it was still cheap well it was still

1035
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,680
more effective to pay

1036
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,520
the criminals to get to get back in

1037
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,960
business quickly even though they had

1038
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,560
procedures to restore that

1039
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,040
although some something failed uh so it

1040
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,280
wasn't clear maybe if they're bluffing

1041
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,119
is this true or not but they did they

1042
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,960
did pay and you know in this case we

1043
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,359
don't know if the insurance paid

1044
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,000
um this is quite good like you know the

1045
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
government now is stepping in to uh

1046
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,200
to basically kind of help uh you know at

1047
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,160
least the kind of

1048
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,079
central government or like well state

1049
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,200
level basically out

1050
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,400
uh you know local government to you know

1051
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,200
fund their

1052
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,920
uh security program uh there was there

1053
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,359
was a bill from uh

1054
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,119
in the new york city uh senate in 2020

1055
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,680
uh that will basically ban uh local

1056
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,280
government to pay for ransom but

1057
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,079
then they sort of blocked that so but

1058
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,960
anyway something is happening and um

1059
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,760
you know like the u.s treasury uh

1060
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,320
basically

1061
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,560
officially added these uh crimeware

1062
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,359
gangs

1063
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,720
into sanction programs uh basically

1064
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,119
not allowing and to see entities or

1065
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:43,920
cities and

1066
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,680
doing business with them like including

1067
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,520
uh paying a ransom so

1068
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,079
and recently president biden's basically

1069
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,320
there was the 12-may statement that

1070
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,680
basically say well you know we should do

1071
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,440
our best to uh uh

1072
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,160
to to basically try to defend our uh

1073
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,599
infrastructure right and

1074
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,400
uh i mean it wasn't anything specific

1075
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,359
but uh

1076
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,599
you know there seems to be a willingness

1077
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,960
from the government to do that which is

1078
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,240
a good thing you know this is

1079
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,720
basically copying you know like the kind

1080
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,480
of same dynamic that happened in italy

1081
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,240
for for the uh for the ransomware

1082
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
uh or for basically lots of people so

1083
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,079
it is a good it's a good way to step in

1084
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:20,800
um

1085
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
the other kind of interesting thing is

1086
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
that ransomware

1087
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
uh needs to basically in terms of

1088
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,960
ransomware attack like there's not

1089
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,640
really a clear regulation about what you

1090
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,000
should do in us

1091
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
uh you know every every state every

1092
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,119
jurisdiction have

1093
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,520
some sort of data or breach notification

1094
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,240
law

1095
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,960
there are some guidelines from ftc and

1096
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,800
finra but they don't really

1097
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,640
describe exactly what you have to do in

1098
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
case of a ransomware attack so

1099
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,440
uh but the companies are quite good in

1100
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,400
doing that they

1101
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,240
they are basically mentioning uh in

1102
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,440
their annual reports and

1103
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,920
quarterly reports um and you know

1104
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,599
special event filings

1105
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,359
uh things are on ransomware like it

1106
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,680
could be an attack it could be like uh

1107
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,200
the special program they have against

1108
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,240
ransomware

1109
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,640
so it's not just reporting attacks it's

1110
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,839
just about anything related to

1111
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,720
ransomware and there are like 820

1112
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,599
documents

1113
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,440
basically mentioning ransomware um

1114
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
so you can see that this kind of uh

1115
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,880
trend has been increasing so

1116
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
like you know which is a positive things

1117
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,280
from 2014 like there were people talking

1118
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,320
about ransomware

1119
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,280
but obviously over time uh you know it's

1120
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,480
basically increasing

1121
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,079
uh there are all sorts of filings where

1122
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,560
you can search that but the kind of most

1123
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,640
important thing is that

1124
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,400
from attackers perspective is that you

1125
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,480
can actually even find out

1126
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,880
how much uh a company has paid to

1127
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,720
restore a ransomware right so you can

1128
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,280
actually

1129
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,000
you know search this uh sec repository

1130
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,040
and find out

1131
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,839
if if a company had a an incident or

1132
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:50,320
like

1133
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,760
what kind of response plan they have

1134
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,960
ransomware and you know how much is

1135
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,400
going to cost them maybe even what

1136
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,320
insurance pride are you using for that

1137
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,040
so what the attacker can do was you know

1138
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,560
it's basically try to guess

1139
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,760
uh how much um run so they should

1140
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,839
so that they can be below the limit of

1141
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,200
the actual cost

1142
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,320
uh that a sub insurance

1143
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,400
coverage can provide so they can

1144
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,599
basically kind of

1145
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,960
adjust their um you know limit so that

1146
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,160
they can basically

1147
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,200
uh be guaranteed to uh to get paid so um

1148
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
so you know with every every information

1149
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,400
disclosure there is also

1150
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
kind of a risk of tipping off the

1151
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,599
attacker which happens uh

1152
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,960
in many many ways um

1153
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,160
there's also essentially um you know

1154
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,760
insurance companies have tried to do

1155
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,160
that that was kind of cute so axa

1156
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,359
uh with the french

1157
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,520
company uh you know it's one of the top

1158
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,400
five in in

1159
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,320
europe they say nine or may we are going

1160
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,599
to stop paying

1161
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,160
uh ransomware right like it was quite

1162
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,920
good i love that but then

1163
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,400
the 19 may just 10 days after that they

1164
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,440
go hit

1165
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
massive ransomware attack uh which

1166
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,640
targeted

1167
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,440
most of the apac regions uh which was

1168
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,320
quite bad

1169
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,119
i don't know if it was kind of a timing

1170
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,040
you know it really happened on purpose

1171
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,839
but it was kind of scary um you know the

1172
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,440
abdominal run somewhere was behind the

1173
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,720
attack and um

1174
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
you know they saw all sorts of things

1175
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,079
unfortunately uh

1176
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,480
but historically like this is not new

1177
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,440
like in uh

1178
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,160
you know 2020 well you know recently

1179
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,520
21st of march cna was was bridge as well

1180
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,319
uh we clipped the locker charm allegedly

1181
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,119
was hit by

1182
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,480
maze on 26 march 2020 some legal firms

1183
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,040
doing

1184
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,000
some insurance rate by ransomware and

1185
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,480
you know aviva in 2009 as well so

1186
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,720
so the so the risk is even like within

1187
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,160
the same insurance company

1188
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,480
uh they have to be reinsured because you

1189
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
know they can't get it by ransomware as

1190
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,920
well right so

1191
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,760
it's kind of an inception problem here

1192
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,319
like uh who is going to be that big to

1193
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,240
reinsure the insurance companies and you

1194
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,520
know they're doing that but

1195
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,599
it's kind of risky itself right so do

1196
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,000
you trust them with your data so

1197
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,599
it's a problem and um uh and yeah

1198
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,720
we can skip through these but

1199
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,000
essentially yes uh lots of things happen

1200
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,119
um i think the most scary

1201
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,680
event in terms of payout was the the

1202
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,440
pharmaceutical company

1203
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,680
uh that they had the ransomware attack

1204
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,440
they have some insurance coverage

1205
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
but he was denied on the ground of act

1206
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,640
of terror

1207
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,000
and i believe they are still in

1208
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
litigation because the insurance company

1209
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,720
never paid

1210
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,200
and it looked like it was an excuse to

1211
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,000
not to pay

1212
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,240
uh the actual uh actual attack so um

1213
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,359
so yeah and no no no very uh

1214
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,200
not very positive things you know when

1215
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,480
you know if you have some insurance that

1216
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,359
doesn't pay off

1217
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,480
uh so so it's not you know it's not a

1218
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:44,960
good

1219
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,000
uh form and i think my deter other

1220
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,680
companies to buy that you know like you

1221
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,040
follow these kind of examples like you

1222
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,760
know why do i

1223
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,440
buy some insurance it doesn't cover me

1224
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,359
from things like that right so

1225
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,520
uh this is happening you know some

1226
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,960
insurance companies are

1227
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,760
basically trying to uh uh try to uh to

1228
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,040
limit their exposures

1229
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,200
uh to run somewhere and what they're

1230
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,119
doing now is to add some limits so that

1231
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,119
if your ransomware attack

1232
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,720
they will only pay you for a certain

1233
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,880
amount like 25 thousand dollars for

1234
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,040
example for ransom related costs

1235
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,200
uh and you know they might add more

1236
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,240
exclusions right

1237
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,960
and um you know as you can see like i

1238
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,000
mean there is a trend

1239
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,119
uh in reducing payments you know in the

1240
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,640
last quarter of 2020 um and

1241
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,000
i think you know it could be two things

1242
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,200
it could be because the insurance were

1243
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,160
not paying

1244
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,640
uh it could be cyber maturity and other

1245
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,440
things but

1246
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,720
but you have to be really careful when

1247
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,480
you buy some insurance you really have

1248
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,960
to check

1249
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,520
all the details to make sure that uh you

1250
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,240
know you have coverage for that because

1251
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,280
you know uh i think my fear is that you

1252
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,960
know before 2019

1253
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,319
or that year uh the market was uh

1254
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,880
you know the there was essentially some

1255
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,319
insurance was cheap

1256
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,920
right so the premiums were sort of um

1257
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
you know essentially inflated and now

1258
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,520
they're realizing like that they are

1259
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,720
actually uh you know they were um

1260
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,640
they were basically incurring a lot of

1261
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,160
recently you know so they're trying to

1262
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,560
so the market is shrinking and

1263
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,079
it's you know the insurance market is

1264
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,440
obvious that there are cycles right you

1265
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,119
know there are periods where

1266
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,160
uh you know good profits you know uh

1267
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,119
everybody is basically uh underinsured

1268
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:23,680
uh and

1269
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,960
everything looks good and then they

1270
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,839
realize you know with these things that

1271
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,000
perhaps uh you know the premiums should

1272
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,280
be higher and so

1273
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,880
you know there's a cycle and you know

1274
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,280
prices are going up so this is always

1275
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,920
happening

1276
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,400
uh so my prediction is that um and some

1277
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,440
people say well

1278
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,760
yeah this thing is going to go up more

1279
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
you know like

1280
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,319
265 billions by 2031 in 10 years

1281
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,000
um i mean it is possible like we might

1282
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,640
get a surge uh in uh you know like we

1283
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,119
can

1284
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,079
might get more of that um and you know

1285
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:56,880
like

1286
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,359
you know this kind of uh predictions uh

1287
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,000
but i think

1288
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
you know like if if the government uh

1289
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,560
put uh regulation in place

1290
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,760
uh and maybe crypto goes down i know

1291
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,359
what elon musk is going to do but you

1292
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,960
know china put the ban on

1293
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,520
people's exchanges and uh con offerings

1294
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,560
russia

1295
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,480
i don't know like most of the attacks in

1296
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,880
this country come from russia

1297
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,200
like i know what they could do with that

1298
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,079
uh but

1299
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,640
i think what we didn't see so much is

1300
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,359
the uh

1301
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,520
ddos type of ransomware attacks where

1302
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,440
you basically your company

1303
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,200
uh it's subject to a ddos attack and the

1304
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,640
cyber criminal basically asks you for

1305
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,560
ransomware to stop that

1306
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,880
but there was uh one event just recently

1307
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,160
a couple of days ago

1308
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,800
where basically fancy lazarus uh ramped

1309
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,079
up

1310
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,760
those efforts for ransom so i think

1311
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,839
we're going to see more of that for sure

1312
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,640
in terms of damages from cyber

1313
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,680
ransomware

1314
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,400
if the government in u.s and europe are

1315
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,599
basically putting all these

1316
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,520
uh you know conditions in place we are

1317
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,400
going to see less less of that for sure

1318
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,680
uh there's another issue with gdpr like

1319
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
okay it's not a big issue in u.s

1320
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,119
although if you have

1321
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,560
you know european customers you can do

1322
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,440
that but the same issues applies to gdpr

1323
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,359
uh so it's not illegal to have

1324
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,400
gdpr coverage uh liability coverage

1325
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,800
under cyber insurance uh which means

1326
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,440
that

1327
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,040
uh it creates sort of a moral problem

1328
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,920
right because uh in that point of view

1329
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,520
gdpr files is that uh you do want your

1330
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,480
uh

1331
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
you don't want that specific company to

1332
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,240
uh to handle

1333
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,319
pii information accordingly right so to

1334
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,000
follow protocols and

1335
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,079
to be able to protect customers data but

1336
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,000
if all they do is to offset

1337
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,280
their risk to an insurance provider then

1338
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,720
it's meaningless this kind of

1339
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,400
legislation is

1340
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,599
useless right so um and currently

1341
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,960
in european union i read a lot of

1342
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,440
documents it's not it's kind of a gray

1343
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:55,920
area

1344
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,119
uh and most insurance providers do

1345
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,839
offer it's a grey area so it depends on

1346
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:02,319
the world

1347
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,160
they do offer coverage for gdpr

1348
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,520
liabilities right

1349
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,160
uh and they did a small survey with uh

1350
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,800
you know

1351
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,640
with 12 csos and unfortunately

1352
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,720
most of them they do use some insurance

1353
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,680
to offset their

1354
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,359
uh gdpr uh risk to uh

1355
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,720
you know uh to basically uh uh

1356
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,359
you know not well i wouldn't say not to

1357
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,880
on private hdpr

1358
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,560
uh but they don't do they don't put too

1359
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,319
much much effort in actually

1360
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,720
developing let's say as a specific

1361
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,000
program similar security

1362
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,160
to protect from uh from a gdpr type of

1363
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,680
breach right from a privacy breach

1364
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,440
and essentially what they do is from

1365
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,359
from their point of view is that they

1366
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,200
want to protect the business right

1367
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,040
they don't really care about much well

1368
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,480
at least most of them they don't care

1369
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,040
about

1370
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,319
their customers sadly uh but they

1371
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,839
mostly care about their business so what

1372
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,680
is more cost effective right so

1373
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,000
should i spend you know one million in

1374
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,880
developing

1375
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,599
a new program to uh you know to protect

1376
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:01,920
uh

1377
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,800
for privacy breaches or do i pay i don't

1378
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,920
know 100 000

1379
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,040
per year to uh you know a premium

1380
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
from a sub insurance provider to be to

1381
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,119
be protected right so

1382
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,960
so this is this kind of balance and you

1383
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,119
know most caesars unfortunately are

1384
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,400
seeing just the kind of

1385
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,599
cost risk analysis and they just do uh

1386
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,680
their choices based on that not all of

1387
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,720
them uh

1388
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,400
thankfully but you also have to remember

1389
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,240
the the average professional life of the

1390
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,040
season it's

1391
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,680
uh you know two basically two years so

1392
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,040
uh

1393
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,200
uh basically they do their best to it to

1394
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,640
keep the business alive

1395
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,839
until they can uh so unfortunately

1396
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,960
that's the kind of uh

1397
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,200
that's the way business works which is

1398
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,839
kind of sad

1399
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,599
there's a more general problem it's

1400
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,960
adoption essentially

1401
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,760
there's not much companies uh buying

1402
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,800
subway insurance

1403
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,280
um you know if you look at the uh

1404
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,800
overall u.s

1405
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,920
budget well the u.s new market uh

1406
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,000
you know companies with more than 200

1407
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,119
million uh

1408
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,520
in basically protection uh cover more

1409
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,800
than 50 percent

1410
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,760
of the uh five billion market right so

1411
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,640
if you have

1412
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,839
250 companies uh with let's say at least

1413
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,440
one dominion protection each which is

1414
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,240
very reasonable you just need five

1415
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,040
losses

1416
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,800
uh to wipe out the entire premium um

1417
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,480
and so what's happening now in the

1418
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,000
market is that the insurers

1419
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,200
uh then gave 50 percent of the opinion

1420
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,960
to reinsure us right

1421
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,280
um and that's the only way basically

1422
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,880
they have to protect themselves because

1423
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,680
you know

1424
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,440
if another large-scale war uh happens

1425
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,079
they basically go past right uh so they

1426
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,760
kind of sell their risk to to other

1427
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,559
reinsurers

1428
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,119
um which is pretty high like i don't

1429
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:47,599
know

1430
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,240
how much is in other sectors i even find

1431
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,760
any specific numbers but

1432
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,960
i've been told 50 it is quite high uh

1433
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,440
you know compared to other markets so

1434
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,200
that's the way it works sadly

1435
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,480
um sometimes it's just some uh

1436
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,119
runs away jokes but uh in uk actually

1437
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,720
the uh the sub insurance market is

1438
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,880
smaller than the pet insurance market

1439
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,000
which is uh

1440
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,440
uh which is kind of fun um recently

1441
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,800
uh somebody uh hacked uh

1442
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,359
cd projekt cyberpunk uh i don't know how

1443
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,280
many people are playing that but it's so

1444
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,720
full of bugs that i think uh having

1445
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,119
the actual source code linked online uh

1446
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,559
it's actually a good thing maybe

1447
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,720
somebody is going to uh go and

1448
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,440
fix the code but uh but yeah i mean it

1449
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,559
is quite bad and

1450
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,680
uh ashley madison was breached again so

1451
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,280
well no picture game but basically

1452
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,800
they're basically running a new

1453
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,000
extortion scam

1454
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,760
uh for the previous customers from the

1455
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,359
previous attack and uh there was

1456
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,640
recently uh

1457
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,880
also somebody stole the source good from

1458
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,160
uh

1459
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,240
from ea which is another video game

1460
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,000
company and you know maybe you can get

1461
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,400
some

1462
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,119
cheats from uh from the source code so

1463
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,240
uh

1464
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,720
i mean it's all sort of you know like

1465
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,160
it's not just like

1466
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,480
you know healthcare and other sectors

1467
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,599
like manufacturing that

1468
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,000
get targeted by even like you know uh

1469
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,440
you know gain companies like

1470
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,079
i guess there's automotive in that and

1471
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,559
you know like dating websites i guess so

1472
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,839
uh so there is that um uh

1473
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,520
i just want to conclude with this slide

1474
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,200
but basically um

1475
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,680
you know like insurance providers are

1476
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,520
making a lot of money uh

1477
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,400
well at least from last year and their

1478
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
main sources of income is underwriting

1479
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,079
they you know investment income where

1480
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,400
they invest uh the profits

1481
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,880
into uh into the stock market you know

1482
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,040
cash value cancellations coverage lapses

1483
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,559
and reassurance

1484
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,160
but what will be beneficial uh i guess

1485
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,839
for for companies rather than

1486
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,240
just buying sub-insurance is essentially

1487
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,000
having them to finance

1488
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,160
uh you know the cyber security program

1489
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
because if you have um if you have

1490
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,200
especially for small companies where

1491
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,559
you know like before they can actually

1492
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,720
buy something insurance like

1493
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,280
the risk is too high that like you you

1494
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:03,760
buy

1495
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,680
uh you buy a policy and doesn't cover

1496
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,119
you for anything basically right so you

1497
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:07,680
buy this

1498
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,839
this policy and it's almost useless

1499
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,599
right you're better off spending the

1500
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:12,800
same amount of money

1501
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,119
uh into into a cyber security program

1502
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,880
but maybe you don't have that or

1503
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,800
you know it's not enough for you so like

1504
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,559
why don't you basically uh

1505
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,400
you know borrow money from the from the

1506
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
insurance provider to improve your

1507
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
uh security monster so that that's um

1508
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,000
that's that's my advice

1509
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,920
