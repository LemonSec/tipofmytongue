1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,040
hello everyone

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,240
uh welcome to track two

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
from b-sides uh san antonio uh here we

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
have oshawn marshall with the opsec

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,760
of protesting let me introduce oshan

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,400
real quick

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,240
he is a developer and security

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,080
consultant with a background in computer

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,640
science

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,599
education and machine learning in his

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,920
roles as secure ideas he works

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
with he works on ongoing development

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,279
projects

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,680
using amazon web services and breaks

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
other people's web applications

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
when he's not swallowing gallons of

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,040
devops kool aids

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
he can be found blasting two steps from

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,480
hell while hacking blogging

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,559
and coding he's going to speak just a

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,480
little bit about what opsec is

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,640
what a protesters threat model may look

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,760
like and

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,000
opsec tactics i'm really excited for his

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
presentation here's oshan

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,840
all right hopefully i'm not muted

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,800
welcome to the opposite of protesting

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,079
don't worry about

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,959
taking screenshots or having to take

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,000
notes

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
everything and i do mean everything i'm

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,280
talking about

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,720
is at tiny si opsec that's my entire

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
slide deck as well as

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
references and citations to all the

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
research going into this

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,920
all right so who am i what do i do

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,439
i code i teach i hack so when

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,000
like in the intro before i am a

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,159
full-time developer and a full-time

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
cyber security consultant and when i'm

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
not doing either of those things i'm

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,920
teaching people how to take over the

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,119
world

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,560
so when i'm doing a penetration test

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
i'm diving into networks and other

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
people's web applications

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
i get to show up show them their

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
vulnerabilities

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,799
tell them that their baby sucks and then

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,240
go home

52
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
but that's last part is really important

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
it's all fine and dandy if i find an

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,280
exploit

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,600
but if i cannot explain in simple terms

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,159
why a particular vulnerability would

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,880
increase

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,000
their operational security risk to

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
my clients or customers and to their

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,200
customers i should say

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,480
that i really can't help

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,480
them improve their security posture so

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
this talk is to help invite you in that

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
same mindset

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
from the perspective of an activist

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
last year i wrote a blog on the opsec of

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
protesting this was immediately after

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
the george floyd

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
brianna taylor ahmed ameri tony mcdade

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
and dion johnson protests and

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
this was a collection of advice i was

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
handing over to some activist friends

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,720
i really focused in on the how

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
so use mfa everywhere encryption at

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,760
wrestling

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,560
transit password managers the whole nine

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,519
yards

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,319
and that's in line with my background

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,599
and the security consulting part of it

80
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,200
but i didn't really focus on the why

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,400
and why is really important why is

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,519
critical

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,560
why determines the risks and that leads

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,040
us to the appropriate countermeasures

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
we're in a quiet moment now but that

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
doesn't mean that

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,879
the government or some other institution

88
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,720
isn't going to do something that you

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,519
disagree with

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,319
so protesting is not just a right here

91
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,560
in america it's a responsibility

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
and societies that fail to adapt crumble

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
and they become stagnated or

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,159
bureaucratic the best feature

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,319
of free and open democracies and

96
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,280
republics

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,000
is the ability to make pull requests you

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,799
can change

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,920
society's source code and once you're

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,439
successful that change is merged into

101
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,040
new legislative policy new executive

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,000
action or

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
judicial reinterpretation of law

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,480
and you have to do this through pure

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,599
for open and honest speech

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,799
and that's the best way to get

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,159
people to change minds and sway

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,000
thoughts to and sway public opinion

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,120
my goal here in this talk is to arm you

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
to the teeth

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,479
because as a human being you have the

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,280
right

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
to vocalize and present your opinion

114
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,080
without the fear of going into prison

115
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,720
and i respect those rights regardless of

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
the outcome

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
let's follow the principle here and get

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
into opsec

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,360
so opsec is the systematic

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
and proven process by which potential

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,240
adversaries can be denied information

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,400
about capabilities and intentions by

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,520
identifying

124
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
controlling and protecting generally

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
unclassified evidence

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
of the planning and execution of

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,040
sensitive activities

128
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,160
the whole point of opsec is

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
protecting yourself from threats by

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
knowing and controlling evidence

131
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,759
of your thoughts plans and actions there

132
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
are no hypotheticals here

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
these tactics and thought processes are

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,720
immediately

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
practical so say this with me

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,120
aya that is i quadruple a

137
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,000
this is this is the five step process of

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,960
opsec

139
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,800
these steps don't have to be taken in

140
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
any particular order

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
but any pre-thought and planning in a

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
previous step

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,520
will help you in subsequent steps

144
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,960
so that first step is identification of

145
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,039
critical information

146
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,919
second is analyzing your threats the

147
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,400
third

148
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,039
is analyzing your vulnerabilities once

149
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,199
you've got threats and vulnerabilities

150
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
you go to number four which is

151
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,240
assessing risk and then finally the

152
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
application of appropriate

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
countermeasures

154
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,199
they all tie together real neatly

155
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
so the first step identify critical

156
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
information

157
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
so what exactly is sensitive information

158
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,560
i'll give you an example of what is not

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,000
sensitive information

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
and that is my naked body um

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,560
i shower at the local ymca so if you

162
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
really want read-only access to me

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
you just have to be mail make a commute

164
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,160
and wake up

165
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
at five in the morning but knowing that

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
information

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
does not prevent me from being a

168
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,479
cyber security professional it doesn't

169
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,319
prevent me from

170
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
holding a job and i t um

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,639
also it's not ex this sorts of

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,880
vulnerabilities are not exclusive to me

173
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,080
so if you've taken a flight from 2009

174
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,520
to 2013 you me and you've gone through

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,639
the tsa

176
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,520
uh remember those full body x-ray back

177
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,639
scanner

178
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
things that they had going on uh yeah

179
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,880
so my point is is people think that

180
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,319
certain bits of information

181
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,599
are critical but they're not and so what

182
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,560
is critical

183
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,039
depends i'll give you an example from

184
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,720
the department of defense

185
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
according to the department of defense

186
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,000
anything

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,240
about dod activities intentions

188
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,599
capabilities limitations that the

189
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,800
adversary

190
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,840
seeks to gain a military political

191
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
technological economic or diplomatic

192
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,319
advantage

193
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,199
is is a critical information

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,639
so usually for a protester

195
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
these are the sorts of things that are

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,639
critical information

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,039
time and location if you're consciously

198
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,360
breaking the law

199
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
uh personal network or donor list

200
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,360
you may be really good at securing your

201
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,520
perimeter and good on your opsec

202
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
but is your significant other is your

203
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
grandmother

204
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
do you sometimes go to your

205
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,919
grandmother's house and use her

206
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,360
grandmother's wi-fi

207
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,720
with a weak wi-fi password

208
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
so there's some risk there

209
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,639
amoral and illegal activity of senior

210
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,280
members

211
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
so if you've got an activist

212
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
organization and someone in senior

213
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
leadership there

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,039
has is a convicted felon or is cheating

215
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,400
on their wife

216
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
if that's if that sort of thing gets out

217
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
or gets leaked

218
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,080
then that poses some reputational risk

219
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
to your organization

220
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,159
so ask any politician for example

221
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,958
so you really need to identify critical

222
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,320
information

223
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,519
then we go into the analysis of threats

224
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,080
so if you're making any meaningful

225
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
change to society source code

226
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
you will be opposed now threats are any

227
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
potential occurrence

228
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,279
that can create an undesired outcome

229
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,519
hurricanes are threats

230
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
but in opsec we mostly focus on people

231
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,120
threats

232
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,680
and we call them adversaries so who are

233
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
your adversaries when you're protesting

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,279
you've got nation states so

235
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,120
you've got governments and law

236
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,279
enforcement but you also have

237
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,399
counter movement protesters if you are

238
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,959
protesting non-violently

239
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,519
your goal is to persuade the mostly

240
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,000
inactive majority to your cause

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,880
some people would put mainstream media

242
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,360
as

243
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,399
an adversary and that's not necessarily

244
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,200
the case

245
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,320
most media outlets don't really care one

246
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,600
way or another

247
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,120
they simply cater to certain

248
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
demographics to continue retaining their

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
attention

250
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
and deriving them as a revenue source

251
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,360
media only opposes you if you

252
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
are boring or your goals and ambitions

253
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,120
run contrary to the revenue streams

254
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
so now that you know who your

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,480
adversaries are

256
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,760
and are not now you need to dive in

257
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,000
now you need to dive into what is your

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
adversary's intent

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,079
and capability from there you can derive

260
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,480
the adversary's goals now some

261
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,200
adversaries want complete subjugation of

262
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
your people group

263
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,480
um some want full-on genocide others are

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,920
just want to maintain a nice status quo

265
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
so usually the goals of an adversary

266
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
are to limit or suppress or stop

267
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,279
the goal any of the goals of protesters

268
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,160
if you do

269
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,320
engage in a protest the goals could be

270
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
like influencing a court decision

271
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,880
uh influencing local and

272
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
re national elections or putting

273
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,079
pressure

274
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,399
on certain institutions the list can go

275
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,120
on

276
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,000
an adversary's goal is anything that

277
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,880
shuts down

278
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,320
any of that so what tactics

279
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
does the adversary use

280
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,880
infiltrators are a real good one

281
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,680
thurgood marshall leaked information to

282
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,959
the fbi about naacp activities to weed

283
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
out communists

284
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,720
um in the in the 50s

285
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
or 60s nowadays when you have a large

286
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,959
protest

287
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,600
you notice that as the crowd builds up

288
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,000
to

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
a couple hundred to a thousand people

290
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,360
someone

291
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
will and someone will all of a sudden

292
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
will throw a brick or a molotov

293
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
and chaos disseminates from there so

294
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,160
violence is also another tactic just

295
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,240
because you're protesting peacefully

296
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
doesn't mean that counter protesters

297
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
are necessarily are protesting

298
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,480
peacefully

299
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,959
they may try to egg you on and try to

300
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,560
provoke a response

301
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,800
which will be and become captured by the

302
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,920
media and then

303
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,519
that narrative will be spun

304
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,200
now surveillance is another good tactic

305
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,639
that the adversary or your threats

306
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
will use and that leads us to the next

307
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,399
question of

308
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,680
a real threat assessment and that is

309
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,800
what does the adversary already know

310
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
about the mission and what is already

311
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,200
exposed

312
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
there may be a police or army presence

313
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,320
at

314
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,440
uh at a protest because the

315
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,880
date and location was leaked ahead of

316
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,839
time

317
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,839
or maybe you've got this hold of this

318
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
presentation late

319
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,160
and some vital information about how

320
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
your organization runs and functions

321
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,240
maybe who's who in your leadership

322
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
you have to plan around what your

323
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,440
adversary

324
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,040
already knows and the level

325
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,360
and the extent and the tactics of your

326
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,399
threats change

327
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,440
between who you associated through as a

328
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,240
threat

329
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,040
in the united states for example being

330
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,399
arrested as a protester

331
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,839
is pretty benign compared to

332
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,200
being a hong kong protesting protester

333
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,880
against the chinese government for

334
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,000
example

335
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
so you really need to focus in on and

336
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
adjust your strategy

337
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
not only based on the tactics of your

338
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,839
threats but your actual threats

339
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,079
themselves

340
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,600
now we go into the analysis of

341
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,560
vulnerabilities now

342
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
here a vulnerability is just the absence

343
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,760
of

344
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,720
or a weakness in an asset safeguard or

345
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,839
counter measure

346
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,959
flaws errors or limitations within your

347
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,600
organization or tech stack are

348
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
vulnerabilities

349
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,480
and your adversary is going to be

350
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,440
collecting critical information

351
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,079
examining it and then acting on it so

352
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,839
you have to take advantage

353
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,440
so you have to take inventory of your

354
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,959
organization

355
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,279
and the technology that you used to

356
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,600
communicate we could take the active

357
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,040
the hacktivist attacks on gab and parlor

358
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,160
for example

359
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,680
and i wouldn't call parlor hack

360
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,639
simply because everything that was

361
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,079
grabbed in that

362
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,440
in that attack was public information

363
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,279
there wasn't any rate limiting on the

364
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,800
platform so

365
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,839
when attackers got on they just simply

366
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,279
scraped

367
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,880
all the public posts gab was actually

368
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,800
malicious it was sqli but

369
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
the reason why the attacker got in was

370
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,639
because the source code

371
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,800
for the platform was publicly available

372
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
so you've got to now analyze your

373
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
platforms you also got to analyze your

374
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,560
people assets as well the

375
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,360
interconnectedness of an activist

376
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,440
community both online and off

377
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,480
is an asset and a vulnerability

378
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,600
navy has a phrase loose lips sink ships

379
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,240
and this is true for activists as well

380
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,760
so my advice here

381
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,160
is make sure that sensitive

382
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,199
communications and plannings of the

383
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,560
inner workings

384
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,440
aren't out on the open internet you use

385
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,160
the social

386
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,399
use social media and the public forum to

387
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,680
get the word out

388
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,519
but you don't have any critical

389
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,199
information out there and you don't

390
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,760
show your hand immediately

391
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,240
one thing i would like to add is you may

392
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,199
not

393
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,000
have an immediate vulnerability but you

394
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,800
may

395
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,519
have some leakage of opsec indicators

396
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,320
and what upset

397
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,880
indicators are it's not critical

398
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
information in and of itself

399
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,040
but if your adversary gets this piece

400
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,519
of information maybe secondary piece of

401
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,639
information

402
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,639
and a third piece and they tie it

403
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,160
together then

404
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,040
all of a sudden they get have critical

405
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,240
information

406
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,040
so a vulnerability could leak not just

407
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,240
critical information

408
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,480
but those little side channel bits of

409
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,279
information

410
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,800
that can be collected together

411
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,160
now we go into risk assessment the risk

412
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,800
is the probability of a threat will

413
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
exploit a vulnerability

414
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,600
to cause harm in information security we

415
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,279
have this famous formula threat equals

416
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,160
not threat risk equals threat times

417
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,680
vulnerability

418
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,399
and so if you want to reduce your risks

419
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,160
you either

420
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,240
address your threats or you address your

421
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,360
vulnerabilities

422
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,000
now as a protester you are not going to

423
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
eliminate your threats

424
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,920
but you can mitigate them and you do

425
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,320
that by denying access to opsec

426
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,519
indicators or denying access

427
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,160
to critical information for

428
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,279
vulnerabilities

429
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,360
every vulnerability within your

430
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,279
organization that you identify

431
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,600
and address also reduces your risk

432
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,639
so blocking information and addressing

433
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,839
vulnerabilities

434
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,079
this could be as simple as just patching

435
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:52,959
your system

436
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,600
if you've got if you haven't been

437
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,519
keeping up with patches and

438
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,600
the operating systems or the devices you

439
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
use

440
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
zero days expo then well there wouldn't

441
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,119
be zero day exploits anymore but

442
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,280
new fresh exploits can be used to

443
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
identify your information can be used

444
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,918
against you

445
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,319
so now we're cooking now we're on the

446
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,919
final step which is applying the

447
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,480
appropriate countermeasures

448
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,799
by all hopefully you've identified all

449
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,839
your

450
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,000
all vulnerabilities that you can in the

451
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,760
beginning and now you can start to

452
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,160
rate which vulnerabilities you you

453
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
address by the risk

454
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,600
now the risk again is the probability

455
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,120
that a threat can and uh expo

456
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
can exploit a vulnerability so from

457
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,960
there

458
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,320
you can have a priority of okay

459
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
this is absolutely critical it's a high

460
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
chance that it will be exploited

461
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,600
therefore we need to address this first

462
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,039
because it's game over

463
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,480
if the adversary gets a hold of this

464
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,600
and the lower risk we can

465
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
keep be aware of them but we really need

466
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,160
to allocate our resources to the things

467
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,919
that are more critical

468
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,120
again we can start address

469
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,720
these risks in priority and the

470
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,080
i and the opsec steps aren't ironclad in

471
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,679
a specific order

472
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,559
but any thought and processing that we

473
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,240
do in previous steps

474
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,760
will apply to later steps so

475
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,160
when we're applying counter measures we

476
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,200
need to assess

477
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,400
what is a good counter measure any good

478
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,160
countermeasure would actually

479
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,080
lower the risk duh

480
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
the second thing that we need to know

481
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,280
about a good countermeasure

482
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,480
is that the countermeasure itself should

483
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,200
not

484
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,799
lead to a leakage of opsec indicators or

485
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
critical information

486
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
then it's not an effective

487
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,000
countermeasure and then finally

488
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
and this is where it all ties in the

489
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,120
cost

490
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,799
of the counter measure must be less than

491
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,320
the cause the risk of the threat

492
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,559
exposing or exploiting a vulnerability

493
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,080
and we'll take it and we'll take an

494
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
example

495
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,880
now that you're armed with this

496
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,360
information we go with burner phones

497
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,000
right

498
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,720
burner phones are actually pretty useful

499
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,760
in staying anonymous in large crowds

500
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,840
but they have their own cost associated

501
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
first of all did you buy that burner

502
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
phone with a credit or debit card

503
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,559
are you using it at home are you using

504
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,720
that burner phone in proximity

505
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,559
to your real phone um brian o'connor

506
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,280
and parties of def co and as part of his

507
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,000
defcon

508
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,039
talk as sees that how shows you

509
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,840
how you can associate those bits of

510
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,559
information and then expose you

511
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,600
so every security control is like that

512
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,120
you really need to work on configuration

513
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,520
with it to make sure that you're

514
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
implementing it properly

515
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,760
tools that are so you don't have to

516
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,480
throw away your phone instantly

517
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,360
tools that are useful that are pretty

518
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,640
easy to implement

519
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
are the same sort of security hygiene

520
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,120
tools so password managers

521
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,320
making sure that your password isn't

522
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,840
um isn't a

523
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,880
20 20 catchphrase that you use

524
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,679
constantly

525
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,840
2020 with an exclamation mark

526
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,320
making sure that you use vpns

527
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
multi-factor authentication on all your

528
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,360
online accounts

529
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,400
and setting things up on your device so

530
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,360
that you use

531
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,080
encryption and rest you've got to be

532
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,880
calm

533
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,240
and you've got to think through uh

534
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,000
how best to address the risk by priority

535
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,240
also join infosec we we have cookies and

536
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,039
uh we have a lot to teach you on how to

537
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,760
be paranoid

538
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,720
and so in the beginning of the talk i

539
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,760
promised you

540
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,799
the how and we would explore the why

541
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,240
as we went through the how is opsec

542
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,799
it is using the five steps identifying

543
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,320
critical information

544
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
analyzing your threats and

545
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,559
vulnerabilities

546
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,760
addressing your risks and applying

547
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,240
appropriate countermeasures now that's

548
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
the how and that leaves us with the y

549
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,640

550
