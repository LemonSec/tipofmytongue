00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,439
of course how we can improve so today's

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,600
talk is about

39
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,200
operationalizing the purple team i've

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,240
spent the last

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,400
about year year and a half talking about

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,159
purple team exercises

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
and bringing value and a lot of

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,759
organizations have done this

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,600
they ran their first exercise which is

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,159
awesome but then i get the question

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,119
what now do we just wait and do another

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,240
exercise or

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,479
what do we do and that is what i want to

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,439
talk to you about

51
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,840

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
miss too much but i'm here with you now

78
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,319
very excited and let's just get

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,519
to it right so one of the big

80
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,080
things that we are talking about today

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,120
is attack

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,400
detect and respond right working

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,599
together to improve and evolve

84
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,840
as the industry involves i mean we've

85
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,159
all seen this happen right if you're new

86
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,959
to infosec welcome you're coming at a at

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,879
a very interesting time where we're

88
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,680
seeing

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
humongous impact of these attacks

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,680
all over the place right uh when the dry

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,519
cleaner or uber driver

92
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
knows about a ransomware attack that

93
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,760
occurred at colonial or jbs

94
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
and they know that you're an infosec

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
they're like what are you doing how are

96
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
we going to help this right

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,120
so i'm really big on leveraging threat

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,159
intelligence

99
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,760
right understanding attack vectors how

100
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
are these attacks happening

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
building from that cyber threat

102
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760
intelligence making it actionable

103
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,840
and then attacking ourselves i've been

104
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,040
doing 10 years

105
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
of offensive security uh at an

106
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,239
organization

107
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,159
and we bring value right because

108
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,680
we are improving we are trying to stay a

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,519
step ahead of the attackers

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
and fix and hopefully detect and respond

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,720
much quicker before we are

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,959
impacted and of course to do all that we

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
have to track our work

114
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,040
long gone are the days where we all

115
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,879
worked in little silos

116
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,760
writing o days you know full disclosure

117
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
days are over etc

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,760
we are all working together and that's

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
what we're going to talk about here

120
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,798
so what does an infosec team look like

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,440
today

122
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,358
well um if you're wondering about these

123
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,600
unicorns these are the scythe unicorns

124
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
they are awesome um what we do

125
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
is we have cti teams right many

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
organizations have cyber threat intel

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,199
teams right

128
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,880
and they spend a time going through and

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
understanding attacks

130
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
grabbing indicators of compromise

131
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
grabbing attack behaviors

132
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,360
and they want their work to be

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
actionable by

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,919
various teams we also have the red team

135
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,880
that works

136
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,160
across the organization finding uh

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
vulnerabilities and uh emulating

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,759
behaviors

139
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
that might or might not work in

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
the organization essentially they're

141
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,240
attacking it

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
before the malicious actors do and then

143
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,039
we have the blue teams the blue teams

144
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,039
are our defenders right they have a

145
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:07,919
tough job

146
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,039
they're working in the security

147
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,440
operations center they're hunt teaming

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,840
they are doing uh defer digital

149
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,759
forensics and instant response

150
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,479
and they're in charge of making sure

151
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,840
that if there is an attack

152
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
that they respond to it and what we've

153
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,120
been doing

154
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
is bringing them together right not

155
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,440
operating in

156
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
silos working together in

157
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
a purple team and we

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,160
started doing purple teaming and

159
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,080
introducing purple teaming as a

160
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
virtual team it's a slide i've used

161
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,120
before

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
and now i'm putting quotes around a

163
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
purple team is a virtual team

164
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
where the following teams work together

165
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
cyber threat intelligence

166
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,800
does the research understands ttps

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
provides them to the red and the blue

168
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,639
team the red team is in charge of

169
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,360
emulating those ttps the blue team is in

170
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,400
charge of

171
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,639
ensuring they have detection and that

172
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
they know how to respond

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,360
to those behaviors so through that we

174
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
publish the purple team exercise

175
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,840
framework

176
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
as you can see there on the right starts

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,600
with cyber threat intelligence

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
there's a lot of preparation because we

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,720
want

180
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
the most efficient use of your time when

181
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,000
we bring everyone

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
together to sit through an exercise we

183
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,280
want it

184
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
all to function right so lots of

185
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
planning goes on

186
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,639
making sure we have target systems

187
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,240
target accounts we're going to hit

188
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
make sure we have an adversary emulation

189
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,160
plan make sure there's an exercise

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
coordinator attendees etc then we run

191
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
the exercise

192
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
we see and learn what is working what is

193
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
not working

194
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,440
and of course we have lessons learned so

195
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
if you've never heard of a purple team

196
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
exercise i'm going to level you up very

197
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,759
quickly

198
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,440
as we get into the next steps so

199
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
in an exercise you have an exercise

200
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
coordinator they present an

201
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,840
adversary that is likely to target your

202
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,759
organization they present ttps

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,680
tactics techniques and procedures those

204
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
behaviors

205
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,160
and the technical details about it

206
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
then you all work together the red the

207
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,160
blue the cti teams the attendees really

208
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,520
interesting when you have senior

209
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
management attendees because

210
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,479
you bring up a ttp let's say downloading

211
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
an iso from the internet

212
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,800
what are the expected controls and one

213
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
might say that's blocked we want to

214
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,520
allow that

215
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,800
what about um download or emailing an

216
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
iso no that's definitely blocked or

217
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
no they'll be caught by our proxy or

218
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
that will be this right

219
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,319
you have that discussion you set

220
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,680
expectations

221
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,840
red team then takes that ttp and

222
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
emulates it

223
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,479
does goes through and shows it on the

224
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,120
screen

225
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,520
a learning opportunity for everyone

226
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,240
there

227
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,759
how do attacks work you're actually

228
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
seeing it red team isn't working

229
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,759
on their own over there in the corner

230
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,280
and then giving you a report of

231
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,599
things that work no they're showing it

232
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,720
to you

233
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
then the blue team after seeing that

234
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
attack goes through and they follow

235
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,759
their process

236
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,280
they look to see if there were any

237
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
alerts there was something that was

238
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,000
logged here

239
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
or there and they share their screens

240
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
again another learning opportunity this

241
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
time for the red team

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,479
to see how the blue team functions and

243
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,360
then if

244
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,919
something didn't meet expectations or

245
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,080
there are opportunities to improve

246
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,639
we do detection engineering this is

247
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,120
where

248
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,199
you enable security controls maybe

249
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,240
enable a log

250
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
or maybe a log was already there but

251
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,360
there was no alert

252
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,679
you tune that you want the alert to

253
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
happen when the malicious activity

254
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
occurs but not when regular activity

255
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,880
occurs

256
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,120
and then you repeat this throughout that

257
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
day or that week however long

258
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,160
your exercise is and of course you show

259
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
value right you track all of this you

260
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
track the ttps

261
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
and these ttps are no longer something

262
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,000
that is

263
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
open or closed right those are

264
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,279
vulnerabilities

265
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,160
a vulnerability is patched or it's not

266
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,760
patched it was exploited or wasn't

267
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,959
exploited right

268
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,480
open close very simple with ttps

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
we are doing behaviors that users can do

270
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,360
so sure there's some blocked behaviors

271
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,320
but

272
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,240
really what you need is for them to be

273
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
logged and

274
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,839
alerted sometimes you have no evidence

275
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,519
so you want to track this the image on

276
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,000
the left

277
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,399
comes from uh one of our partners plex

278
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,040
truck

279
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,240
which is a reporting solution

280
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,200
tracking ttps no longer has open close

281
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,519
but

282
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,720
actually as alerted and logged or not

283
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
logged or blocked

284
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,440
and then on the right you have vector

285
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,519
vector is a free tool that allows you

286
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,920
also to track ttps and shows you

287
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,519
uh how you improve over time so that

288
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
is a 10 minute or less intro to purple

289
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,320
team exercises

290
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
if you want to learn more about purple

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
team exercises we have the purple team

292
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
uh exercise framework it's free you can

293
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,560
download it

294
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
um and we're actually working on version

295
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,959
two so we've learned a lot running

296
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
purple team exercises

297
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,399
from the consultant perspective because

298
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,640
we go companies say hey

299
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,440
purple teaming looks awesome i've never

300
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,040
done it i don't know where to start i

301
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,720
read the framework but can you help

302
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,640
us and yes we of course can help you so

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,079
if you're interested in stuff

304
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,640
definitely let us know hit me up outside

305
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
of this talk

306
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
but if you want to do this on your own

307
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,800
download this framework

308
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
and uh check it out so

309
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,279
great intros over we

310
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,640
finished our first exercise high fives

311
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,360
virtual double high five for all of you

312
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,959
what now

313
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,040
well now we need to operationalize this

314
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
right we can do purple team exercises

315
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,720
maybe

316
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,360
once a month once every two months once

317
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
every three months

318
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,240
etc right periodically but

319
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
we know that we're gonna get new ttps

320
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,279
discovered we're gonna see new attacks

321
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,519
and what do we do with all that other

322
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,720
time right

323
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
the red team goes and works in their

324
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
silo again the blue team goes and works

325
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,959
in their silo

326
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,079
cti ghostworks in their silo no we want

327
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
them to continually

328
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,120
work together one exercise is great

329
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,079
but to get that collaboration it can't

330
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:24,640
just be

331
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,000
ad hoc so we are going to operationalize

332
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,519
that and that is what we're going to

333
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,920
talk about today

334
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
if you already have operationalized

335
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,959
purple teaming

336
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,279
that is awesome where do we see this

337
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,160
going

338
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,519
dedicated purple team as

339
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
a group of people that have experience

340
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
with cyber threat intelligence with

341
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
attack and with detection and response

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,959
and they work together understanding

343
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,600
threats

344
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
and detections it's a very tough job

345
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
you need experience but through using

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,680
a very simple step like i've just shown

347
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,560
here going from

348
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
a purple team exercise to operationalize

349
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
to dedicated you can get there too

350
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,000
so our focus today for this talk is

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,959
how do we operationalize purple teaming

352
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,519
as

353
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,880
virtual teams working together so

354
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,560
we built a new cycle the cycle

355
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,480
starts when new cti or ttps

356
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,519
are identified and anyone can do this it

357
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,120
could be the cyber threat intelligence

358
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
team that just

359
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,440
read something new because they read

360
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,680
every cti report out there they're on

361
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
top of all of these attacks

362
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
it could be the red team the red team

363
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,079
should be focusing on finding

364
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,720
new ways to do things the red team

365
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,760
should not be

366
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,040
repeating ttps over and over

367
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,240
because you can automate that the red

368
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,800
team

369
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,800
should be building new and finding new

370
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,800
ways of doing attacks or the blue team

371
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
might have found something they're going

372
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,160
through

373
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,120
their day-to-day and they see maybe the

374
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,040
hunt team sees something hmm this is

375
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,639
interesting i haven't seen this

376
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
attack before anyone can provide

377
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
and initiate this process right

378
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,320
cdti red and blue working together you

379
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
send this out hey check this out brand

380
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,399
new cti

381
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,120
let's review it then you assign a cti

382
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,639
member a red team member a blue team

383
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,200
member

384
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,079
to work together then over on the right

385
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,200
step two

386
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,959
we are going to analyze and organize

387
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,600
these ttps if it was a full attack

388
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,160
then we want to map that attack to miter

389
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,800
attack

390
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,199
we want to correlate with previous test

391
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,000
cases

392
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,639
are these really new ttps that we've

393
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,320
never tested before

394
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
or have we tested it maybe it's a new

395
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,720
procedure

396
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
is it the same procedure if it's the

397
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,480
same procedure and we feel we have

398
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
coverage we can verify that

399
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,720
and your process can be over and for the

400
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,760
short term

401
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,560
but if it's new then we need to have a

402
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
tabletop discussion

403
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,399
this is how this attack works according

404
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,079
to the cti

405
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,360
what is our expected detection response

406
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
you have that conversation for the

407
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,800
various ttps

408
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,079
the red team will then understand the

409
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,040
threat

410
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,399
and emulate the attack one of the things

411
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,000
i'll show you all the way at the end

412
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,040
is a purple team maturity model

413
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,600
that covers deployment integration and

414
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,560
creation

415
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,279
as you mature through it but the point

416
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,959
here is the red team will emulate this

417
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,839
attack

418
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
while the blue team watches then

419
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
the blue team will understand what

420
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,279
detections they have

421
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,079
they will see if they need to create

422
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,360
something new

423
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
if they need to integrate something

424
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
deploy something and then

425
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,000
repeat this once you do build out this

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
new control new method of finding

427
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,120
something

428
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,839
then you'll have to repeat that same ttp

429
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,519
while you train your people

430
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,120
right sock analysts right so far we've

431
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
only had three or four people working

432
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,680
together we want to inform the greater

433
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,160
team

434
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,720
let everyone in cti know about this new

435
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,279
cti

436
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,639
and how it currently affects the

437
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
organization let everyone on the red

438
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
team know

439
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,079
this new attack method so that they add

440
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,000
it to their library and add it to

441
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,720
their automation and then the blue team

442
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,079
knows about this attack

443
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
knows that if they get an alert what to

444
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:33,440
do

445
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,839
about it so that is what we're gonna go

446
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,639
through here

447
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,399
and if you've ever gone to my talks you

448
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,320
know i like being very practical

449
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,160
so let's get to it step one

450
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,360
new cyber threat intelligence comes in

451
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,880
right in this case cti read this

452
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,360
new email this new blog post from

453
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,680
microsoft's threat intelligence center

454
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
a new sophisticated email based attack

455
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,720
from nobelium cti team reads this says

456
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,120
huh

457
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,079
it's interesting let me share this with

458
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,480
our

459
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,440
virtual purple team email goes out or

460
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
you do it through a ticketing system

461
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,079
a tracking system wherever you can

462
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,959
implement this

463
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,639
i've seen it done in jira i've seen it

464
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,560
done in archer we can do it on a number

465
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,079
of different places the point is

466
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,519
notify the virtual uh purple team

467
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,320
let them know hey microsoft thursday

468
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,079
this one was thursday afternoon

469
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,079
uh their second one was on friday

470
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,920
afternoon right before memorial day

471
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,480
right

472
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,639
always comes in at that time right we

473
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,680
can't get something

474
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,160
on i don't know a monday afternoon no it

475
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,519
always has to drop at the end of the

476
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,560
week right

477
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,399
so we assign whether it's self-assigned

478
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,839
or manager assigned

479
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,160
be like oh this looks cool i'll take it

480
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,440
i'll be the red teamer that's going to

481
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,000
take it

482
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
the blue teamer says all right i'll take

483
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,360
this one and of course

484
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,600
the cti person that found this will be

485
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,399
involved

486
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,800
so what do we have we are going to

487
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
initiate

488
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,839
our purple team

489
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:09,418
[Music]

490
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,730
[Music]

491
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
just

492
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,640
sorry i couldn't keep a straight face on

493
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
that one so a little comic relief there

494
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,960
we get together now we need to do step

495
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,480
two analyze and organize these ttps

496
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,960
what did we see well we have to read

497
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,120
through this dense cti report

498
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,000
we need to extract the ttps we need to

499
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
map them to miter attack

500
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
and then we need to correlate with

501
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,799
previous tests

502
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
so let's take a look if you haven't

503
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
heard of this attack this was

504
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,760
uh microsoft found this essentially

505
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,360
uh this group this threat actor

506
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,760
compromised

507
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,120
the constant contact of

508
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,720
usaid usaid is a legitimate organization

509
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
constant contact is a legitimate email

510
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,160
sending provider they are used to

511
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,440
sending newsletters

512
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
and emails to people that subscribe so

513
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,280
you people that were interested in usa

514
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
have subscribed to usaid

515
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,039
they are receiving newsletters from them

516
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,799
all the time the threat actor

517
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,000
compromised their uh their constant

518
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
contact account

519
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
essentially allowing them to build an

520
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
email

521
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,520
and send it to legitimate users

522
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,640
that are used to and expect to receive

523
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,080
emails from them

524
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,280
they get this email and it says

525
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,400
view documents what happens next

526
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,720
well it was a spear phishing email it

527
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,039
had an attached html

528
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,799
that performed html smuggling that html

529
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,799
smuggling attack downloaded an iso file

530
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,840
that iso file had a malicious

531
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,200
link a shortcut file that then

532
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
ran a dll and

533
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,080
there was also a decoy

534
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
file in there so if we look at another

535
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,559
screenshot here

536
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,760
we see it loaded an image called

537
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,559
d e class all in uppercase it had the

538
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,520
documents.dll file

539
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,600
it had an ica d-class.pdf this

540
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,520
is a decoy this is a real pdf file

541
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,440
and there's a shortcut there called

542
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
reports

543
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
if someone double-click the shortcut it

544
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,679
would execute the dll

545
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,320
so if we look at the shortcut we see it

546
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,919
was running this dll

547
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,600
and opening it and essentially launching

548
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,960
the command and control payload

549
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,000
and establishing a connection to some

550
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,400
server so thankfully

551
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,960
this particular article this particular

552
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,760
cti

553
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,640
had miter attack mapping now when we do

554
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,039
miter attack mapping

555
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,840
one it's good to see it in reports but

556
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,280
we're really looking

557
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
for the procedure level

558
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,919
right so in this case initial access

559
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,880
tag two spear phishing via service new

560
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,520
bellium

561
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,080
used the legitimate mass mailing service

562
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,640
content

563
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,200
constant contact to send their email yep

564
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,159
in that email there was a url so there

565
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,039
was a link

566
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,080
that they clicked on it so that's t1566

567
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,520
excellent and then microsoft

568
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,280
um decided to tag execution

569
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,080
as t1610 deploy container a payload is

570
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
delivered via an iso file which is

571
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,080
mounted on a target computer

572
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,120
i looked at this one and i thought this

573
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,000
this isn't right deploy container is

574
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
more about deploying

575
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,320
docker containers so

576
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
what do we do we go on the mitre attack

577
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,640
slack

578
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
right are you all part of minor attack

579
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,840
slack you definitely should

580
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
we have awesome conversations there some

581
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,840
of those conversations lead to

582
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,280
very fun polls on twitter so we debate

583
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,760
this

584
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,240
whether is this deploy container or not

585
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,960
and

586
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,159
we reach the conclusion it's not

587
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,400
actually putting a payload in an iso

588
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,280
file

589
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,320
is a bypass of mark of the web so

590
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
even though this is amazing cti provided

591
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
by microsoft a

592
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,679
top security company amongst other

593
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,720
things

594
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
the mapping might still not be correct

595
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,559
right and there's biases around here

596
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,240
there's great papers around this

597
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,559
and this is why you need multiple people

598
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,280
working

599
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,120
together because someone could have

600
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,480
detected this but

601
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,960
let's move on then user execution

602
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
malicious link

603
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
the user double-clicked on a shortcut

604
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,440
file and then

605
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,000
application layer uh for command and

606
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,720
control

607
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,320
dll connecting over https fantastic

608
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
now let's analyze and organize this for

609
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,440
our

610
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,000
pleasure i like building little tables

611
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,679
they're easy to read

612
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,320
so description of this new bellium the

613
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,679
russian threat actor behind the

614
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,640
solarwinds com

615
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
uh attack compromised constant contact

616
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,600
to send malicious emails

617
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,640
with a weaponized iso file resource

618
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,000
development

619
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
this wasn't tagged before resource

620
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
development is a new miter attack tactic

621
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,919
right it came from pre-attack and

622
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,360
essentially

623
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,200
we mapped it to t1584006 which is

624
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,919
compromise

625
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,880
infrastructure a web service say

626
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,799
compromise constant contact

627
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,840
to then do spear phishing via service

628
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
constant contact spear phishing a link

629
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,679
a link that downloads and does html

630
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,039
smuggling

631
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,720
and then defensive agent t1553.005 this

632
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,799
is actually the correct mapping

633
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,640
of using an iso image because an iso

634
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,039
image

635
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,799
is not an ntfs file

636
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,520
so it's not marked with mark of the web

637
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
which is mark of the web

638
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,159
when you download something from the

639
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,760
internet and you try to execute it you

640
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,520
generally get the smart screen

641
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
pop-up that says hey this is bad i'll

642
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,720
demo that for you

643
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,200
uh right now if uh when we got to the

644
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
demo

645
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,159
and then it actually ran run dll32

646
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,520
to execute that dll and

647
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
it was executed of course when the user

648
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
double-clicked a malicious

649
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,720
file a windows explorer shortcut so this

650
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,360
is also a

651
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,840
small deviation from the cti's attack

652
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,640
mapping

653
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,159
and then command and control was the

654
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,559
only application layer but i also used

655
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,919
an encrypted channel

656
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,960
so you can see that something net new

657
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,080
can have multiple ttps for us to

658
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,120
take a look at so we have

659
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,799
and we look at this and say is there

660
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,200
anything new anything we haven't tested

661
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,240
before well

662
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
constant contact is an email service

663
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,799
that people subscribe to we've never

664
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,279
used that to deliver phishing emails

665
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,960
then we have that hard discussion of can

666
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,720
we even emulate that

667
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,559
can we hack into constant contact and

668
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,760
send emails from there

669
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,320
or maybe mailchimp or maybe some other

670
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,679
email provider

671
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,320
probably not right maybe we can simulate

672
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,360
this some way

673
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,679
maybe work with them but this is going

674
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,360
to be a lot tougher conversation to have

675
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,120
we'll give that to our managers let them

676
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,200
deal with it what we can do

677
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,360
is take a look at t1553005 this is

678
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
subvert trust controls mark of the web

679
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
bypass with an iso image

680
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,480
so essentially if we create an iso image

681
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:44,960
and we

682
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,880
host it on the internet when you

683
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,159
download that image

684
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,720
you're able to execute it without any

685
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,000
other control

686
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
saying hey stop what are you doing

687
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,400
something bad might happen

688
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,440
so we can then inside of that iso

689
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,919
include a shortcut that executes a dlo

690
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
via run dll32 we've done that one before

691
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,720
right

692
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,320
run dll32 is used by like every single

693
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,600
ransomware threat actor right but we can

694
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,159
test that

695
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,120
too and have we tested this before well

696
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,679
we've tested run dll-32 before

697
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,480
but we haven't tested downloading an iso

698
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,279
image

699
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,520
from the internet that's weaponized this

700
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
is net new to me

701
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,559
i'm sure there might have been some

702
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,880
other cti out there that's where you

703
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
asked the cti team hey

704
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,919
can you check into this while we build a

705
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,880
test case

706
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,760
so what do you do for a test case you've

707
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,480
never done

708
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
you do some research what's a great

709
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,600
place to start

710
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,000
atomic red team right atomic red team

711
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,840
has a bunch of atomic tests

712
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,880
a great starting point to see

713
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,559
if there's a quick test you can do and

714
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,240
unfortunately there wasn't an atomic

715
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,520
test for this

716
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,640
so this is a perfect candidate

717
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,000
for our purple team step three let's

718
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,799
tabletop this now we know that this was

719
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,039
an

720
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
iso downloaded from a browser

721
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,960
on an internet site what kind of

722
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,159
expected

723
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,000
detection and response would we have

724
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
here well

725
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,159
are we allowing iso downloads on the

726
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,400
browser

727
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,000
is our proxy detecting that an iso

728
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,080
file is being downloaded and can we

729
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,200
block it

730
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,559
or maybe our next gen firewall can see

731
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,600
this

732
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,159
it's a good test case what about if

733
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,840
someone's hosting a malicious iso file

734
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,360
internally will the browser block that

735
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,960
from being downloaded since we it

736
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,320
wouldn't be going through proxies or

737
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,480
next-gen firewalls

738
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,799
have to see it i don't know do you know

739
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,240
do you know if you in your organization

740
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,720
are blocking isos at the browser level

741
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,799
and then we also think about a little

742
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,039
more test cases

743
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,760
this was also an email what if the iso

744
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,320
file

745
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,200
came as an attachment on that email have

746
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
we tested that

747
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,960
well maybe our external security

748
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,559
provider blocks

749
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,760
iso and image files coming from the

750
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,679
outside

751
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,919
i'm going to have to check but what

752
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,960
about internal

753
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,279
if someone internally sends an iso file

754
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,320
that is malicious would outlook

755
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,200
email allow that will our endpoint

756
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
security allow that with the email

757
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
server the security on the email server

758
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
allow it i don't know

759
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
what about mounting the iso do we have

760
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,600
any detection for that

761
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,120
how often do do end users mount isos

762
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,760
probably never right i can see an i.t

763
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,880
administrator mounting an iso but

764
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
are end users do we detect this

765
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,840
and then of course execution from

766
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,279
an iso i don't know what about

767
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,520
unmounting the iso so you have this

768
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,640
discussion of course

769
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,279
i just did this role-playing here on my

770
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,440
head on what i think most organizations

771
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,159
would answer

772
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,320
but your organization is different you

773
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
see the cti you have to sit and think

774
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,919
through these test cases

775
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,200
so step four let's

776
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,840
create an iso how do you create an iso

777
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
that's a great question i mean i

778
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,520
remember back in the day we would create

779
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,559
isos and

780
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,559
you can create a windows 10 iso with

781
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,640
that little windows 10 thing

782
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,440
but how else can we do it well i use

783
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,159
twitter

784
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,919
and i want to give a shout out to matt

785
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,279
grabber matt

786
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,080
station definitely worth following and

787
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,200
very quickly

788
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,440
matt wrote something on twitter that

789
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,720
that made a lot of sense

790
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,520
adversaries choose iso and image as

791
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,799
delivery vector

792
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,720
because smart screen doesn't apply

793
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
because it's a non-ntfs volume good

794
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,640
that's very good technical detail

795
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,640
in this test he created an iso

796
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,559
that has an e a hello.exe if you click

797
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,000
and load it it won't get prompted so

798
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,960
thank you matt that was an awesome test

799
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,840
case

800
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,159
then did some more work my friends over

801
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,279
at outflank

802
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,279
mark smee and the whole team there had

803
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,120
an article back in march

804
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,559
about the mark of the web and getting um

805
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,600
around this and then at scythe

806
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
i actually had talked about this talking

807
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,039
about defensive asian because

808
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,720
when you download an executable from the

809
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
internet you have the mark of the web

810
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,840
so we had a nice place to start but

811
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,360
i want to emulate the entire attack so

812
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,279
sorry for this slide that has a lot of

813
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,399
words but

814
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,200
this is the attack we set up command and

815
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,279
control using https

816
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,399
on 443 and we generate a dll payload

817
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,120
if you're not familiar with how to do

818
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,480
this first step

819
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,559
check out the c2 matrix how to

820
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,799
how2.c2matrix.com

821
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,399
you can download a virtual machine that

822
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,919
i built with sans

823
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,480
you can get up and running set up a cd2

824
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,320
and create a dll payload

825
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,520
in a variety of c2 frameworks

826
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,039
many of them empire covenant mythic

827
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,360
right all of these allow it right not

828
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,960
the scope of this talk

829
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,120
what we want to focus on is how do we

830
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,640
build this iso and weaponize it well

831
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,279
i went online and found multiple ways of

832
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,960
doing this and in particular

833
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,360
i used the folder to iso project so

834
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,559
shout out to them

835
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,120
again not my work folder to iso is

836
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,080
someone else's

837
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,919
shout out to them we are working

838
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,000
together and i hosted this up on our

839
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,120
github

840
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,240
you then copy and rename this dll

841
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,600
that you created in step one

842
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,960
documents.dll and you put in the folder

843
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,840
to iso working directory then in the

844
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,600
folder to iso working directory you're

845
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,120
going to create a shortcut called

846
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,159
reports

847
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,640
and set the target to run dll32

848
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,559
documents.dll and the entry point then

849
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,000
from a command prompt

850
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
because i like doing everything on a

851
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
command prompt even though forward to

852
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,039
iso is a gui app

853
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,120
on one liner folder to iso take

854
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,200
everything in the folder to iso

855
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,039
and build out t1553.005.iso and we're

856
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,399
going to call it the same d

857
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,559
class then you have to add some other

858
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,000
parameters there

859
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,440
now we deliver this iso we host it on a

860
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,240
web server

861
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,399
we send it as a phishing link all the

862
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,880
different test cases we talked about

863
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,799
then when someone downloads this iso you

864
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,320
can either double click it

865
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,480
or you can mount it with powershell and

866
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,000
you see i do a lot of things

867
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,080
on command line you'll we'll get to that

868
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,120
in a minute

869
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
and then once it's mounted double click

870
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,279
the shortcuts and see if this works

871
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,080
now of course i documented all of this

872
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,519
because

873
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,120
it's all about giving back right so

874
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,399
demo time let's pray some demo gods

875
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,000
quick uh quick uh

876
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,720
item there so i'm gonna use scythe this

877
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,200
is not a sales pitch i am literally

878
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,360
just doing this for b-sides san antonio

879
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,240
because this is the easiest way for me

880
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,919
to create a dll

881
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,080
i literally click next three times

882
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,760
and we start a campaign

883
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,440
we then download this dll select the dll

884
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,960
download the dll yes keep that

885
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,840
and we're done that's it now

886
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,880
steps what do we do well we

887
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,840
follow the community threats page that

888
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,440
explains what to do

889
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,880
we grab this dll

890
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
and we need to rename it to

891
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,600
i'm gonna copy and paste because

892
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,159
if this doesn't work it's because i fat

893
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,279
fingered something

894
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,360
not because it doesn't work

895
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,919
documents.dll

896
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,640
we're gonna cut that and put it in this

897
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,440
folder

898
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,600
so this source folder you can clone from

899
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,640
github

900
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,519
you go into folder.iso and you put it

901
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,159
here

902
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,600
now my decoy pdf is actually

903
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,080
the cis security controls version 8 that

904
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,200
just came out

905
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,640
so you have uh some good decoys there

906
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,320
then we look at this reports uh shortcut

907
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,480
we go to properties and we take a look

908
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,279
there what it's going to do

909
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,720
it's going to execute run dll32

910
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,919
yep on documents.dll

911
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,120
with its entry point perfect

912
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,760
let's actually rename this to dll in

913
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,279
uppercase i don't think it makes a

914
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,480
difference

915
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,200
but i'm not taking chances on live demos

916
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,840
so

917
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,360
the next step follow my uh

918
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,320
items here we run folder to iso take

919
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,559
everything in folder to iso

920
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,440
put it into this iso file and call it d

921
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,399
class

922
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,320
hit enter and it's going to build my iso

923
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
so over here we have an iso look at that

924
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,679
not too big

925
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,799
1.4 1.4 megs

926
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,600
now we host this somewhere right let's

927
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,119
simulate that because

928
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,839
ain't nobody got time for that and then

929
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:12,320
we go

930
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,000
on to another machine this is called sky

931
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,079
and i actually need to delete this one

932
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,359
because that was my test

933
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,440
so let's assume that someone just

934
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,480
downloaded this brand new file

935
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,000
it's now on the downloads folder

936
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,040
because it's an iso we can't mark it as

937
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,800
mark of the web normally down here

938
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,199
would say this came from the internet

939
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,399
it's not

940
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,960
now there's multiple ways for us to

941
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,000
mount this

942
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,320
we can mount this with powershell or we

943
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,079
can just double click it

944
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,280
right a normal user and how the us8

945
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
attack worked is

946
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,239
they double clicked it so we double

947
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,719
click this and it automatically mounts

948
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,639
and takes us right here

949
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,280
and if the user falls for it they double

950
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,960
click this reports

951
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,160
nothing happens you say huh that's weird

952
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,400
well let's take a look at something else

953
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,720
let's open up this file oh look the cis

954
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,320
controls that's pretty cool

955
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,800
and nothing happens nothing else happens

956
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,359
we

957
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,599
are like all right that's cool we go

958
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,560
back over to

959
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,079
our attacker machine and there we have

960
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,240
our callback we have our shell over

961
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,160
https just how we created it

962
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,920
and we run a little who am i just to

963
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,079
prove that we are on that machine and

964
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,000
we get the response back i think i sell

965
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,480
five second callback so

966
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,960
in a couple seconds there you go we got

967
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
it working

968
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,880
fantastic let's get back

969
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,079
to our slides so

970
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,079
we ran the test

971
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,839
ran the test and it was successful

972
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,560
so what hypothesis do we have well we

973
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
have to do detection engineering now

974
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,440
we would have if i had time only have

975
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
six seconds so i'm gonna speak a lot

976
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,520
faster

977
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,680
so detection engineering this is the

978
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,960
part where now we know

979
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
that this attack worked that machine i

980
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,480
ran this on had all av

981
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,040
had everything clearly a bypass smart

982
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,599
screen

983
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,800
bypass all our detections so what

984
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,480
hypothesis do we have well

985
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,280
an iso file downloaded from the internet

986
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,599
by

987
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,839
a non-it user is suspicious an iso file

988
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,040
sent via email

989
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
is suspicious and iso mounted

990
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,359
is suspicious on on any user's machine

991
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,079
that's not an

992
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,520
it user process execution from a mounted

993
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:45,920
drive

994
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,400
is suspicious and a network connection

995
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,520
from a process

996
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,599
that runs from a mounted drive is

997
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,520
suspicious i want to give out a shout

998
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,960
out to cyber monk

999
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,000
he wrote an awesome post on

1000
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,200
detecting uh these iso images it was a

1001
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,160
two-part post

1002
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,079
so shout out to him reached out to him

1003
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,680
on twitter asked him hey

1004
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,760
can i show you some of this work and of

1005
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,040
course they said yes so

1006
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,839
cheers to you another shout out to randy

1007
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,960
randy wrote some cool uh detections here

1008
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,079
this is sysmon

1009
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,720
on sentinel but not everyone has that

1010
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,200
right

1011
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
maybe you have something else well let's

1012
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,480
look at what we got

1013
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,599
where was this logged did the proxy

1014
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,400
see an iso being downloaded if we would

1015
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
have sent this iso in an email

1016
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,480
would it have gotten through did we have

1017
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,079
visibility does the email

1018
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,920
server see that can we block that

1019
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
extension

1020
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,520
what about antivirus antivirus doesn't

1021
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,800
catch anything right

1022
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,839
edr well depends on your edr this is why

1023
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,440
you have to test you can't just

1024
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,119
plug in your edr and say yeah we're safe

1025
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,079
millions of dollars spent we're good no

1026
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,400
you need to train your people

1027
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
you need to tune as new things come out

1028
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,680
hopefully

1029
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,839
you have at least this law ddr does a

1030
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,520
great job at logging this stuff

1031
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
but why isn't there an alert can we

1032
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,040
create an alert

1033
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,359
and sysmon you can detect some of these

1034
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,560
behaviors on sysmon

1035
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,480
it's actually what uh randy did over

1036
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,599
here

1037
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,320
and then of course you need to send

1038
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,200
these logs

1039
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,119
you have to send them somewhere if it's

1040
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,440
an edr generally it's already being sent

1041
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,359
if it's sysmon you have to send that

1042
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,640
sysmon uh

1043
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,839
alert as well uh log and then

1044
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,160
you need to create alerts once you

1045
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,359
create the alerts

1046
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,760
you then train your people because

1047
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,640
detection

1048
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,599
isn't just an alert is someone seeing

1049
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,480
this and saying

1050
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,760
oh we just got an alert that this

1051
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,400
endpoint

1052
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,800
in the accounting department just

1053
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,599
downloaded and mounted an iso

1054
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,760
probably something we need to look into

1055
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,960
or better yet

1056
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,359
try to block it right only allow certain

1057
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,280
people to download these types of files

1058
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,520
right different things different ideas

1059
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
all recommendations

1060
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,280
and then of course what is the response

1061
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,240
so

1062
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,280
as i did this testing

1063
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,160
i had started with atomic red team there

1064
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,320
was no atomic test for this

1065
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,599
so i built one i gave a shout out to

1066
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,160
carrie

1067
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,800
roberts who uh is super patient with my

1068
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,520
terrible

1069
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,079
ability of creating atomic tests adam

1070
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,839
machinshi who runs the uh

1071
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,720
red team uh the atomic red team and the

1072
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,320
open source stuff at red canary and of

1073
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,400
course red canary who uh are the ones

1074
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
supporting atomic red team

1075
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,400
so built this out on atomic red team did

1076
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,520
a bit of testing

1077
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,079
so now you can do that test now that

1078
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:36,560
test

1079
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,560
is a little different if we

1080
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,079
take a look at that test

1081
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,839
what does this test do well we actually

1082
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,359
created two atomic tests

1083
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,079
one mounts the iso the second one mounts

1084
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:50,960
the iso

1085
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,000
and runs the executable so now you

1086
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,640
without having to set up a c2 or

1087
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,839
anything like that

1088
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,599
can come here and use this atomic test

1089
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,680
it has a prereq command where it's going

1090
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,880
to download

1091
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,839
this iso this iso that's on atomic red

1092
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,000
team is not weaponized it's

1093
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,240
not weaponized it does not have a dll it

1094
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,599
does have a shortcut but

1095
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,480
the shortcut doesn't execute anything so

1096
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:16,800
you

1097
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
download that shortcut that iso file and

1098
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,400
then you can actually

1099
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,680
mount it through powershell

1100
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,359
you can then dismount it atomic test 2

1101
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,920
uses that that executable created by

1102
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,920
manifestation so same

1103
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,040
initial steps you download this iso

1104
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,359
called feel the burn

1105
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,400
you then mount it and of course this one

1106
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,079
has to because you're going to run

1107
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,839
something in there you have to determine

1108
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,079
the drive letter when you mount an iso

1109
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,520
the drive letter that mounts is going to

1110
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,880
be different on every host

1111
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,800
depending on how many drives they have

1112
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,920
so it grabs the drop the drive letter

1113
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,359
and then it executes that hello.exe

1114
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,760
you then of course can dismount it and

1115
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,200
stop the process

1116
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,280
so now anyone that wants to test this

1117
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,160
can easily test this without weaponizing

1118
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,040
the whole thing

1119
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,800
if you're a red teamer though of course

1120
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
you want to weaponize the entire thing

1121
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,200
so if you want to follow step by step

1122
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,240
how to do this

1123
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,480
it's obviously on the slide but i've

1124
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,240
also posted it in our

1125
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,560
scythe community threats github which

1126
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,359
are just that

1127
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,000
community threats number of attack

1128
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,720
chains

1129
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,280
that you can use to test yourself some

1130
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
of them require sites some of them you

1131
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,640
can do manually this one you can do

1132
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,280
manually

1133
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,760
of course the step one we cover how to

1134
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,680
do it with site you can do it with any

1135
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,880
other c2

1136
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,400
how to dot the c2 matrix has abundance

1137
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,440
of resources

1138
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,839
for you to do that and

1139
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,920
last few things what happens next

1140
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,160
you have operationalized this new ttps

1141
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
come out you check them

1142
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,880
eventually we are seeing organizations

1143
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,760
building

1144
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,160
dedicated purple teamers so i always

1145
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,760
said that this was a virtual team

1146
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
but in talking to some of our more

1147
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,800
mature

1148
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,000
clients they are actually building and

1149
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,040
having a dedicated team so the red team

1150
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,520
still focuses on building new stuff the

1151
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,720
blue team focuses

1152
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,160
on uh detections and this dedicated

1153
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,520
purple team

1154
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,000
works on looking at these new items of

1155
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,680
course you still operationalize this

1156
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,040
you're still bringing red and blue

1157
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,680
together

1158
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,920
but their main thing is to understand

1159
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,720
threats

1160
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
understand the attack and understand the

1161
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,760
detection so

1162
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,520
this purple team maturity model was

1163
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,119
created by tim schultz

1164
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,040
who works with me at scythe he's our

1165
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,480
adversary emulation lead

1166
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,079
and was presented at the purple team

1167
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,680
summit so essentially

1168
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,760
your purple team your people need to

1169
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,440
have a threat understanding

1170
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
and a detection understanding and as you

1171
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,000
build that out you have deployment

1172
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,200
integration and creation that you do for

1173
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,319
each attack and each

1174
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,880
detection something i try to do here as

1175
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,160
a virtual team

1176
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,040
of course uh better have the dedicated

1177
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,680
team

1178
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,599
now if you want more content we love

1179
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,040
giving back to the community

1180
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,280
and that's we everyone at scythe uh the

1181
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,240
unicorn so

1182
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,800
we have a threat thursday blog there we

1183
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,720
look at bigger threats of full attack

1184
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,280
chains

1185
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,440
we understand the attack the adversary

1186
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
we consume cyber threat intelligence

1187
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,359
we map it to mitra attack if it's not

1188
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,040
already done we release

1189
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,000
adversary emulation plans in json for

1190
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,280
attack navigator

1191
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,200
as well as forsythe we emulate the

1192
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,440
adversary and we then do detection

1193
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,359
response and it's all available

1194
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,880
for free for you to see on our blog

1195
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,520
so references like i said i did not do

1196
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,240
all of this

1197
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,119
on my own shout out to microsoft who was

1198
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,359
the original cyber threat intel on this

1199
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,280
manifestation for showing a brief proof

1200
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,240
of concept

1201
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,960
randy uh from uh binary defense

1202
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,359
uh he was pretty much my blue teamer

1203
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,200
here building out some detections for

1204
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,760
this

1205
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,359
um so shout out to to randy um

1206
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,400
and what else red canary of course red

1207
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,040
canary

1208
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,480
and the uh detection blog as well so all

1209
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,160
these references like i said

1210
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,640
didn't do this on my own we are a herd

1211
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,160
we all work together we have to

1212
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,119
collaborate

1213
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,040
and with that i think i did it right on

1214
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,079
time

1215
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,119
uh so i want to thank you for yours

1216
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,160
and we'll take any questions that you

1217
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,920
have

1218
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,839

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,520
presentation today

1223
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,000
it's fantastic do you plan on sharing

1224
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
that in discord

1225
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,200
yes i actually i'm going to plan share

1226
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,480
the references

1227
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,880
i am going to hold off on the slides

1228
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,119
because i'm actually presenting this

1229
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,760
at wild west hackfest on thursday so you

1230
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,200
all got it here first for coming to

1231
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,079
b-sides

1232
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,200
but i'm gonna present it there i want to

1233
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,280
kind of maintain it uh that way i know

1234
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,200
we had smaller audience here

1235
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,839
um so yeah do want your feedback though

1236
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,520
because bigger presentation there

1237
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,040
um and yeah you all got to hear it first

1238
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,480
so

1239
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,560
let me know how it was if you enjoyed it

1240
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,079
if anything i can improve

1241
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,560
uh it's the first run i did so the

1242
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,160
timing was a little off i want to spend

1243
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,359
a little bit more on detection

1244
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,000
engineering

1245
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,400
showing some of the sysmon uh logs that

1246
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,599
show up and whatnot

1247
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,920
but i know uh i know what i got to work

1248
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,880
on and

1249
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,680
uh and yeah i'll share the resources

1250
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,160
though of course 100 i'll post those uh

1251
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,280
in the discord right now george uh

1252
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
i think uh looking through the discord

1253
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,400
chats during the

1254
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,040
session you got positive positive

1255
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,599

recordings

1261
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,599
uh be available i believe

1262
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,000
if george accepted the

1263
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,240
the ability to share the sessions then

1264
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,480
those those recordings will be available

1265
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,680
after the con so thanks again george i

uh we're here and let's continue this

1282
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,960
conversation i this

1283
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,760
test case i purple teamed via twitter uh

1284
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,839
with manifestation and randy

1285
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,880
um who are you know very good detection

1286
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,079
uh engineers

1287
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,640
so uh so let's continue the the

1288
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,839
discussion and

1289
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,760
and uh hopefully we can all connect and

1290
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,040
work together we're a herd

1291
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,720
and i'm a hacker i'm also a security

1292
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,640
researcher and an advocate for hacking

1293
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,760
is not a crime

1294
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,359
and i'd like to share with you what

1295
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,240
being a hacker means to me

1296
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,359
because you see since i was a

1297
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,680
young young child i've always been a

1298
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,800
hacker

1299
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,880
i was the kid that liked to take my toys

1300
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,839
apart

1301
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,599
to figure out how they worked and to see

1302
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,400
if i could make them work better

1303
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
when i turned 12 years old i got a job i

1304
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,839
saved up enough money and i bought

1305
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:42,319
myself

1306
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:46,240
my own computer and on that computer

1307
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,040
i wiped it clean started from scratch

1308
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,800
figured out how to build it from the

1309
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,640
ground up

1310
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,240
learned programming so that i could

1311
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,480
write my own software to run on my

1312
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,599
computer

1313
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,079
i learned modem communications and

1314
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,160
serial communications

1315
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,440
so that i can figure out how these

1316
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,440
online services that i like to use

1317
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,119
were working and so when i got into my

1318
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,000
career

1319
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,079
i took a lot of different twists and

1320
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,280
turns

1321
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,119
i started off as a penetration tester i

1322
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,319
moved into consulting i worked at high

1323
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,520
executive levels

1324
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,160
building massive application security

1325
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,359
programs across a

1326
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,559
large enterprise organization

1327
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,160
i worked for product companies and

1328
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,000
resellers

1329
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,480
but through it all the one thing that

1330
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,640
stuck with me was this identity

1331
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,920
of being a hacker now we hear the word

1332
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,440
hacker thrown about in the media and

1333
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,960
it's usually connected with some type of

1334
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,079
criminal activity

1335
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,599
but being a hacker does not mean being a

1336
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,079
criminal

1337
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,599
being a hacker is all about this innate

1338
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,520
curiosity this passion to understand how

1339
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,960
things work

1340
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,480
and to see how we can make them work

1341
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,240
differently better create

1342
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,200
new things i'm reminded of a quote from

1343
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,800
a keynote given by

1344
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,119
jason street one of my colleagues in

1345
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,319
which he said

1346
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,319
hackers are inventors and creators

1347
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,440
not criminals and freaks and that's the

1348
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,280
reality

1349
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,880
hackers are people who want to make
