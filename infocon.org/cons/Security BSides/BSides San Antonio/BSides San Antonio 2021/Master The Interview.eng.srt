from time to time

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,600
we need people to work in

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
the area for me and for my colleagues at

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,039
the organization

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,719
and we're trying to interview and get

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,960
more people to work and so

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
during so in the last few interview

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
sessions that we've done

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,360
for the last few positions i've noticed

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,840
a

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,360
a large valley between

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,439
uh the different candidates that are out

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
there apparently they

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
have run the gauntlet and they have been

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,000
able to get through

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,720
the ai or whatever else is used by our

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,240
hr department or

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,799
anyone's hr department these days to get

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,759
their resume

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,840
to the top of the list and get that job

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
interview

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,439
but then they go to the interview and

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,479
even though they've done

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,479
all of these things ahead of time it's

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,520
just it just doesn't work for them

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
uh either maybe they oversold their

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,119
enter their resume

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,920
or maybe they just need to get a few

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,960
more extra skills and tasks

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,240
that they can do to push themselves over

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,040
the top to be able to get that job

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,680
so let's get ready first i really

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,799
recommend

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,960
nist nist has a bunch of wonderful

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,160
documentation

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
on just about everything when it comes

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,080
to cyber security and one of the things

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,760
that i really really like

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,319
that came out in 2017 and now it's been

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,080
updated in 2020

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,239
is the nice document the national

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,440
initiative for cyber security education

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
so so they kind of changed their

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
terminology they used to do

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,879
um tasks knowledge skills and abilities

65
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
now they've changed it into task

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,840
statements knowledge and skill

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,959
statements um

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,959
but it's nice because if you want a

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,160
particular role

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,760
or position in it this gives you

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
um oh you might want to mute your mic

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,599
there on the other side

73
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,959
because i hear a little bit of

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,760
background noise um

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,239
what you might want to do is is look up

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,440
a particular position that you're

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
interested in doing

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,280
and see how many of the skills uh

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,040
statements and task statements

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,840
and knowledge that you've already gained

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,239
to

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,080
put you in the right spot to get that

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
particular position

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,280
and it also gives you an idea of the

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,959
deficiencies and things that you might

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,599
want to

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
improve upon to make sure that you work

88
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,480
really well and you're going to succeed

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,760
in that position

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,239
whether it's the resume portion of it or

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,440
the interview or

92
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,519
actually doing the work it kind of gives

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
you a much better foundation

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
to make sure that you're ready to go for

95
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,040
those particular jobs

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,760
and this nice document it's okay it's a

97
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,080
bit technical and it's a bit dry

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
but it's also a wonderful source of data

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,280
so please consult that like i said it

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
was updated in november 2020

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,879
so um they've changed it a little bit

102
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,840
i try and make sure that when we are

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,120
looking to hire people

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
that they actually fit into

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,239
the roles for this cyber security

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,879
education document

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,799
the other thing i really recommend if

108
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,239
you just kind of want to get excited

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:02,879
about

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,680
finding a position in it and i.t

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,640
security

112
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
is to go to cyberseek.org and look at

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,159
their heat map

114
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
their heat map allows you to categorize

115
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
jobs that are open out there in a couple

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,199
of different ways

117
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,880
one of them you can look them by state

118
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,798
and the other one you can look at it by

119
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,000
uh area so there's actually a

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
san antonio new braunfels area and it

121
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
shows the total number of job

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,199
openings that are there um workforce

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,560
employed

124
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
the amount of demand the certifications

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
that they're kind of looking for for

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
those particular positions

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
or other types of things you can drill

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
into different various

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
areas of this thing you could drill down

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,400
in here this is just a jpeg image of it

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,960
but i

132
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,160
really recommend you take a look at

133
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,479
cyberseek.org

134
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,919
heat map and there will be links in the

135
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,240
breakout area later i'll actually be

136
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,080
posting the presentation as well

137
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,600
plus of course this will be on youtube

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,960
and i'll provide the links there for

139
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
them to put on the youtube page

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
so you're going to go interview you

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
finally ran that gauntlet

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
you've got the interview scheduled and

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
everything

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
well you need to do a little research

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
you got to do some homework

146
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
don't just walk into an interview cold

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
where you don't know anything about who

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
you're going to be interviewing with

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
how long have they been in business i

150
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,680
mean just some basics

151
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,199
get the company history mission

152
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,000
statement vision statement

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
it's really important to kind of get a

154
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
feel of the corporation that you're

155
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
going to be working for the company or

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
the organization um

157
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
do some research on news articles and

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
stuff have they been in the news

159
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,160
for charitable events are they been in

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,759
the news for

161
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,160
sec violations if they have been in the

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,120
news for

163
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,840
whatever you want to get a feel of the

164
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,759
culture of the organization

165
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
obviously if they've been in the news

166
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,919
for lots of

167
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,080
you know hanky-panky going on there or

168
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,919
stuff you want to know that before you

169
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,120
walk in the door you don't want to walk

170
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,400
in there and find out that

171
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560

investigation of the federal government

176
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919

got out of there early uh they they did

183
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,720
a little bit better when the mass of

184
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
people were

185
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,080
let go when they shut that thing down it

186
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000

244
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,760
what's the interview format so um

245
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,559
i'm i'm a stickler whenever there's a

246
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,039
any kind of job i'm going for

247
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,080
so many years ago back in the 90s i

248
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,760
actually was looking to become a police

249
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,640
officer

250
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
that didn't work out for me but i

251
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
learned some wonderful skills doing so

252
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
and one of the things that i did is i

253
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,959
found out

254
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,160
what was required to run the gauntlet to

255
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
get that first

256
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
uh kind of seat at the table right

257
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,839
to where you can begin the process and

258
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,320
so

259
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,880
700 people walked in to take a test that

260
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,240
was like the written s-a-t

261
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,080
or a-c-t test and of the 700 people

262
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,279
70 people passed that part of the exam

263
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,399
so they only took the top 10 percent

264
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,399
because i knew that going in i was able

265
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
to make sure that i had the skill sets

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
necessary to work the problems that that

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
type of test

268
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
provided and i was one of the 70 people

269
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,480
then

270
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
they said hey you need to be able to

271
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,959
do certain physical activities after the

272
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:37,920
test is that

273
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
that same day yeah i think they're

274
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,959
written in the morning physical in the

275
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,320
afternoon

276
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
so where do you do this uh well they

277
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,680
showed it and they

278
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,519
said you got to do this kind of weights

279
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,800
and this kind of this and this kind of

280
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
sit-ups and this kind of run

281
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,440
a mile and a half on concrete in the

282
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
middle of the day

283
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
in the heat in the summer and stuff so

284
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
i trained to make sure that i was ready

285
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
to do that so at the end of the day

286
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
there were only 35 people out of the

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
original 700 that finished the day

288
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
and i was very happy to be in that 35

289
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,360
group

290
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
unfortunately like i said next set of

291
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,399
culling process i didn't make it through

292
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,320
it just didn't work out for for me of

293
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
them but i learned some valuable skills

294

to prepare uh i know somebody they went

314
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
to go interview and they thought they

315
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,079
were just gonna be talking to the hiring

316
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,279
manager and they walked in and there's

317
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,880
like six people in the room

318
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,320
and it made them very nervous and very

319
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,560
reserved and stuff and

320
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,120

and just because there's six people in

325
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,880
the room versus one person in the room

326
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,519

uh on people and how long they've been

340
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,800
there and the different roles that

341
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
they've had at an organization

342
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,880
other organizations that they work for

343
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
other roles that they've had

344
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,639
sometimes people even post the

345
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,519
charitable work or hobbies that they do

346
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,480
and so that's a very insightful

347
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,360
information

348
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,399
because you want to make sure that

349
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,200
you're you know

350
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
got your best foot forward in the job

351
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,160
interviewing process

352
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
what do we want to know about the people

353
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,839
that we're interviewing

354
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,760
right i'm not some hr professional i

355
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
don't have years of experience doing

356
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,000
this

357
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,760
or anything but there's some basic

358
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,079
things i need to know right

359
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
how are you going to contribute to the

360
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,360
employer or

361
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
to the organization that you're working

362
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
for what can you

363
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,359
bring to the table

364
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,000
so do you are you the kind of person

365
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
that's going to seek out and take the

366
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,760
initiative

367
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
in i.t security it's very important to

368
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,760
have people that are

369
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,240
self-starters and go-getters right and

370
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,079
the things that you can show that you've

371
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,120
done

372
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,040
that portray you as a self-starter and

373
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,120
go-getter that would be really good you

374
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
have to have that inner

375
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
drive a lot of times to be able to go

376
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,399
and find out some of these problems

377
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
and and tackle them so that's

378
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,279
uh that's one of the things that we're

379
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,800
looking for

380
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
for people to do that and for some

381
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
people uh cultures and stuff it's

382
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,680
difficult

383
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,600
uh for people to be other than reserved

384
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,880
and i recommend you work with people as

385
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,920
much as possible

386
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,519
to try and break out of those things um

387
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,600
a lot of people have imposter syndrome

388
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
and stuff i'm just as guilty as anyone

389
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,040
else for that

390
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
and trying to break past that shell

391
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
is so much a part of what you need to do

392
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,720
to do a successful interview because

393
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,639
you know i don't want to sell myself

394
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
right i don't want to just you know

395
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
i'm not here there's like a marketing

396
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,480
thing but in some ways that's exactly

397
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,320
the mindset you have to be you have to

398
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
be the marketer

399
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
you're marketing yourself and your

400
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,800
skills to that

401
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,079
organization so

402
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,800
if you have taken some examples or some

403
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
initiative

404
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
have some examples that you can show

405
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,639
that oh hey

406
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
i saw this problem and i self-started i

407
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,639
found a way to solve this problem and i

408
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,120
attacked it and and took care of it

409
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,920
uh got whatever i needed to get that

410
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,800
done

411
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,959
organized it and made that kind of thing

412
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,399
uh happen so

413
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,800
that's uh really important to be able to

414
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,120
show that that you can

415
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,360
contribute greatly to the organization

416
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,880
this is one that we've run into a lot

417
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
and especially in my last sets of

418
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,880
interview

419
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
processes that uh was was an issue

420
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,279
um so uh the the last set of interviews

421
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,440
that we're doing was in january february

422
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,480
um of this year and so it's like

423
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
we'd ask questions so what's going on in

424
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
cyber security is there any news out

425
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,639
there

426
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,440
that's uh happening and when we were

427
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,560
doing that

428
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,839
uh we were expecting you know there's a

429
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,920
couple of really large things going on

430
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,600
in cyber security that are not just

431
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,160
making

432
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,600
the cyber security news but they're

433
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,519
making the suit the news

434
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,040
um the nightly news almost every night

435
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
um and for example one of them was the

436
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,880
solar winds breach that happened

437
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,000
december 13th

438
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,440
or at least it was publicized december

439
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
13th um and in january they're still

440
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,639
just

441
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,160
finding all kinds of information out

442
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,399
about what was going on there

443
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,600
um a number of the candidates

444
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,079
uh fully admitted that they weren't

445
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:36,959
keeping up with

446
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,800
cyber security news and stuff so

447
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,320
it moves fast in i.t you got to keep up

448
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
to date

449
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
whether you go read leaping computer

450
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
once a week or if you

451
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,399
take a listen to some podcasts out there

452
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,680
internet storm stormcast

453
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,560
cyberwire there's a number of others

454
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,959
techme

455
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,680
being able to uh keep up is really

456
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,959
important

457
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,720
i t security moves even faster than it

458
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,839
um the uh

459
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
so you know twitter though not a uh

460
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
authoritative source there as long as

461
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,959
you can do some original research

462
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,600
it is a very good source for some of the

463
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,920
breaking news type things

464
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,959
you can also once again cyberwire has a

465
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,000
nice daily

466
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
podcast of 20 minutes and you can run it

467
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,279
on a high speed and

468
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,360
get through it pretty quick and it's a

469
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
really great way to keep your finger on

470
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,399
the pulse of what's going on

471
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,920
in cyber security there are other

472
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,759
podcasts out there as well

473
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,600
but those are pretty much a good minimum

474
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,920
to to do if you want to consume it via

475
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,319
audio

476
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,560
be prepared to answer these types of

477
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,920
questions

478
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,680
the employers especially in the i.t

479
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,040
security field want to make sure that

480
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
you're engaged in the organization

481
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,199
in in your field and being disengaged or

482
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,639
actively disengaged is

483
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
is not going to do very well in an

484
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,839
interview

485
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,319
got initiative what have you done for

486
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,439
yourself lately

487
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,400
right have you earned a certificate or

488
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
degree

489
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,959
you don't necessarily have to maybe you

490
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,520
just did a ctf maybe you're going

491

and you contributed and you volunteered

492
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,559
at b-sides

493
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,799
that you're out there you know doing

494
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,119
what you can

495
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,160
have you read a book from the

496
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,039
cybersecurity canon the cybersecurity

497
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:29,600
canon

498
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
is a list of books that was originally

499
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
started by a gentleman that was at palo

500
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,880
alto but it's now it's

501
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,919
taken care of by ohio state there will

502
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,280
be a link to it

503
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,679
and they get nominations for

504
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,720
and add to the canon of books that every

505
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
cyber security professional

506
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,960
should read i have not read some of

507
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,799
those books and i am looking forward to

508
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,200
it

509
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
some of the books are quite obvious like

510
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
the phoenix project

511
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,559
uh if you are not aware of the phoenix

512
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,240
project you should be

513
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,440
it's an excellent book when it comes to

514
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,640
being able to find constraints and move

515
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,320
processes along find out where things

516
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,360
can be better how do you

517
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,799
uh you know look at a process

518
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,080
and and and look at a problem and

519
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,400
and hopefully find some solutions for it

520
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
the other books that are out there right

521
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,400
now

522
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,960
is one of them is called code girls it

523
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,080
is about

524
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,679
how women were brought in from colleges

525
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,520
and universities to help uh crack

526
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
the um codes during world war ii we're

527
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,440
talking about 10

528
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,720
000 people that were brought in to do

529
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,679
this work

530
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,720
and it was one of the more unsung uh

531
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,000
stories out there uh it's totally uh a

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,760
very impressive book

533
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,400
so um take a look at it they also have

534
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
fiction books out there

535
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,039
for those that have not done it one of

536
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,400
the books that they have on there is

537
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
called cryptonomicron

538
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,120
it is not an easy read it is 800 pages

539
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,480
by neil stevenson

540
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,120
but that book there is is really

541
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,640
interesting it's almost like

542
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,200
um you know predicting of bitcoin

543
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,280
predicting of all kinds of other things

544
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,160
out there

545
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,640
neil stevenson that and snow crash it's

546
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,440
another

547
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,960
book cyberpunk kind of genre um

548
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
but those are kind of good things to

549
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
have too so like you know

550
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,600
being able to be well read uh in

551
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,840
the organizations or in the field that

552
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
you're in

553
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,440
so what have you done for others have

554
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,000
you mentored so have you gone out even

555
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,320
even anybody with any kind of skill sets

556
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,919
even at the beginning

557
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,679
um you probably have more skills than

558
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,679
others so what can you do

559
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,679
you can go to cyberpatriot and sign up

560
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,200
to be a mentor there

561
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,840
finding a school nearby that has a cyber

562
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,720
patriot

563
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
team and offer to um

564
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,039
mentor students in particular areas

565
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
if you can teach it you know it very

566
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,400
well you

567
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,919
you have to learn it well enough to

568
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,080
teach it right and so

569
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
um cyberpatriot gives everybody the

570
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
opportunity to be a mentor

571
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,840
uh i am going to be starting that back

572
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,919
up again now at the pandemic is over and

573

575
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
i'm going to be getting right back into

576
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,480
the thick of it and becoming uh

577
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,120
fully active again in cyber patriot to

578
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,200

579
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
isn't some just a weekend warrior kind

580
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,120
of thing it's a

581
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,960
mini month long mini group long

582
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,320
event that the let's say

583
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,720
i know of one particular student in high

584
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,520
school

585
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
that basically had full ride

586
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,200
scholarships to multiple colleges

587
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
after this they had done what they did

588
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,120
it

589
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,280
truly impressive work um that they uh

590
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,640
can can teach kids in high school uh

591
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,039
and and continue on further with their

592
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,720
career

593
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,720
um can you think um you know

594
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
some of the people interviewing you

595
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,320
really want to know

596
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,880
do you think how do you think right how

597
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,559
do you approach a problem

598
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,000
especially a problem that you've never

599
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,520
seen before and so

600
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,039
you know can you talk out loud

601
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
your thoughts and observations when

602
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,400
working through

603
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,440
let's say an exercise i give you

604
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,880
a thing a widget whatever it is and uh

605
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,440
ask you about it and tell you to

606
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,039
describe what you're seeing

607
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,039
most likely you've never seen the things

608
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,679
that i would provide you i'm an old

609
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,280
ham radio operator i've been working

610
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,360
with computers for over 30 years

611
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
i still have some components from 30

612
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,400
years ago that

613
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,480
trust me almost no one born since 2000

614
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,559
will ever have seen these things

615
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,760
um so it's uh

616
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,600
it but it's nice because it does give

617
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
you an opportunity to

618
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,679
uh discuss what you're looking at um

619
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,480
let's say it's an

620
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,039
interface card that you've never seen on

621
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,159
a bus structure

622
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,720
you've probably never heard of but you

623
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,320
should be able to walk through and talk

624
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,960
through

625
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,120
what's going on and what you're seeing

626
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,760
in your hands whether it's a

627
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,880
whatever kind of device it is so um

628
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,440
i've got some weird tools in the toolbox

629
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
the same kind of deal what could this

630
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,559
possibly be used for

631
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,080
right um

632
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,679
how about a question like this is what

633
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,760
is a particular motorcycle way

634
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,880
right how would you

635
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
find the answer to that question

636
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,960
uh if that was posed to you in a meeting

637
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,559
or interview process

638
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,400
so you know the nice thing about it is

639
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
there's not a lot of wrong answers here

640
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
the probably the only wrong answer is

641
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,360
i don't know how i would even do that

642
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,159
that would be a

643
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,559
probably the only wrong answer any other

644
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,280
thing you do

645
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,440
whether you're saying well i could take

646
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,679
uh you know a gallon of milk

647
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,000
that weighs this much and i could put it

648
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,280
at the end of a

649
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,000
fulcrum that's got a pivot point this

650
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
distance away and pick up the motorcycle

651
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,760
and i know how much it weighs or

652
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,559
something

653
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,720
um you know for me i would look at the

654
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,840
owner's manual

655
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,280
because in the owner's manual it gives

656
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,799
you the dry weight and the wet weight of

657
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,080
that motorcycle

658
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,720
but um but yeah you could uh you could

659
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,559
do it a number of different ways but

660
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,520
once again uh the only uh the only wrong

661
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,720
answer there is the

662
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,799
the opposite war games is not to play

663
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,280
you you should want to play these games

664
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,120
right there are many ways to do a thing

665
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,200
pick one or two go for it even if you

666
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,279
you um

667
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,120
you come up with multiple ways of doing

668
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
it give them all out there

669
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,120
and stuff because people want to know

670
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
that you can think through issues

671
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,240
because we're going to find

672
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,360
unknowable um and things that we have to

673
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,960
learn on the fly problems

674
