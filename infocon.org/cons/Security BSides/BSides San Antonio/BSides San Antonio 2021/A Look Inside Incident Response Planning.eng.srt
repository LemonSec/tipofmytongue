the host of cyber speaks live

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,079
a cyber security podcast series with

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,559
some of the most amazing guests

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,680
from this community the same community

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,559
that you're

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
partaking in today so uh be sure to

check that out wherever

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,480
you listen to podcasts so with that

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,440
being said

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,680
i'm going to jump right in to things

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,920
uh we're going to skip the whole bio

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,239
stuff i've got a lot of content to cover

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,520
with you guys

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,680
this should actually be like a half day

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,600
full day workshop

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
but we're going to try to condense as

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
much of it as possible

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,400
into this 45 minute window so

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,040
uh my contact information is on screen

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,920
i'll have it again

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,880
at the end don't worry about things like

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
taking notes or anything

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
i've got great speaker notes with you

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,880
know all the same kind of stuff that i'm

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,400
going to be talking through

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,640
there's a link at the end of my slide

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
that you'll be able to download

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,439
the powerpoint with the speaker notes

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,920
immediately after this presentation

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
it's one of the things that i like to do

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
as a presenter is make that stuff

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
immediately available to you

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
don't worry about note-taking you can

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,240
just follow along

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
and uh download the speaker notes

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,920
afterwards okay

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,600
so moving forward

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
the first thing we need to really talk

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,560
about is the stages

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,520
of incident response so as we look at

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,920
how

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,079
we prepare our organization to handle

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,520
a cyber security incident you know

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
we need to understand the stages but

56
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,959
unfortunately

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,920
the incident response authorities can't

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
seem to come to

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,440
a general consensus if you will on

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,520
the exact phases of incident response

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
you know so whether there's four five

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:26,720
six

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,080
even seven phases involved uh

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
depending upon which framework you're

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,879
using they all seem to share

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,080
you know some version of the core

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
elements of identification

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,720
containment eradication

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
and recovery those are like the four

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
common elements now they may be grouped

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,160
into

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,560
some other phases depending upon the

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
framework but

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,920
uh you know the precursory and resultant

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,040
phases like preparedness and

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,879
lessons learned you know some of those

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,319
add to the number of

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,959
overall phases but essentially all the

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
frameworks are the same it's just

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,120
how they group these and how they term

81
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,840
them

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
um you know things like containment

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,319
eradication and recovery as one

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,360
phase or detection and analysis

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
as another you know that's the case with

86
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,519
organizations like

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,519
nist for example uh so regardless which

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,640
framework you adopt there are many

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,280
uh of them out there the important thing

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,519
is to adopt one of them and stick to it

91
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
learn the phases and what's required to

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,440
move

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
from one phase into the next and that's

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,400
really not just going to be a

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,840
aspect of the team that's assembled

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
but also the executive sponsor

97
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
needs to know what is required to move

98
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,239
from one phase to the next and should be

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,200
familiar with

100
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,159
all those phases because ultimately your

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,799
executive sponsor will get into this

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
in more detail but they're going to be

103
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,560
responsible

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
for making that determination

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
uh now in the speaker notes i do include

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,000
several different examples of

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
the frameworks that are out there and

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,280
you'll see

109
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,639
how they differ on

110
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,040
the naming conventions the number of

111
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
phases how they

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
group uh tasks that are required

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
into particular phases so be sure to

114
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
check out those examples

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,400
moving on um

116
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
conducting an incident response risk

117
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,479
assessment

118
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,840
should be one of the first aspects

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,360
of creating your cert

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,039
team and putting them to work and

121
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,039
an ir risk assessment is not

122
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,479
a and when i say i ir obviously i'm

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,199
talking about

124
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,440
incident response but i don't want to

125
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,479
use

126
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
acronyms without explaining them so our

127
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,759
incident response risk assessment

128
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,080
you know it's not just a vulnerability

129
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
risk assessment like we commonly

130
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,440
think this is not

131
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,680
a technical assessment but one that's

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,600
based on

133
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,759
organizational risk and primarily

134
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,240
those that get grouped into one of four

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,840
categories and those would be legal

136
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,039
financial reputational or operational

137
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,479
and unlike our

138
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,960
traditional assessments i looked at

139
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,759
things like

140
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,080
how our networks and systems and

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,800
data may be attacked by cyber criminals

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,560
ir risk assessments look at what is the

143
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
fallout if they are successful you know

144
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,600
what are we going to have to deal with

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
and what is the risk

146
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,039
the financial the legal the

147
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,479
reputational risk to our organization

148
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
if they do have a successful attack and

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
depending upon which type of attack it

150
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,319
may be

151
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,160
what is that risk level now the output

152
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
of this ir risk assessment will be

153
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,759
what the incident response team um

154
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,720
executive sponsor uses for threat

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
classification

156
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,120
and prioritization which again we'll

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,160
talk about it

158
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
in a bit but uh that's essentially

159
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,639
what this resulting assessment

160
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,199
report will provide them as the details

161
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,759
about

162
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,599
how to classify and prioritize the risk

163
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,960
uh to the organization as we've talked

164
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,000
about

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,720
now these risk assessments

166
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,240
may also be part of whatever industry

167
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,520
you're in

168
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,919
where you're conducting business where

169
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,720
you are

170
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,960
headquartered um who your

171
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,840
your suppliers who your customers are

172
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
all these things can have

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,360
an impact on what state federal or

174
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,800
industry regulations may require

175
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,160
a risk assessment and most notably

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,120
and most recently and when i say most

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,160
recently i mean

178
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,919
this month if we look at what has

179
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280
transacted with the recent cyber attacks

180
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,120
against the united states pipelines

181
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,400
the output of that or the outcome i

182
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,960
should say

183
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
of that is new directives coming from

184
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,599
the tsa

185
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,400
who is responsible for the us pipelines

186
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,280
and

187
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,879
their safety uh they've just put forward

188
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
a new cyber security directive that

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,039
does state in addition to some other

190
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,319
very aggressive

191
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,360
directives regarding notification

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,440
timelines which we'll talk about when we

193
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
get to that section

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,520
um being able to name

195
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,879
to at least cyber security coordinators

196
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,000
that are available

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,840
24 7 around the clock and responsible

198
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,159
for

199
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
the cyber security of the owner operator

200
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,679
of that pipeline but in addition to that

201
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,599
they've got this 30-day window from i

202
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,560
think it was

203
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,920
uh may 28 to be able to

204
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,760
conduct this uh cyber security risk

205
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
assessment based upon their

206
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
existing cyber security controls and

207
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,240
best practices

208
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
and they only have a 30-day window to

209
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,560
complete that assessment do a gap

210
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
analysis

211
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,279
and provide remediation recommendations

212
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
for their own organization back to the

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,959
tsa and csu

214
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,720
so um you have to pay attention to what

215
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,399
industry you're in you have to pay

216
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,600
attention to

217
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
where you're conducting business where

218
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,080
you're headquartered etc because

219
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
you may have various state federal

220
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
uh european union or

221
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,320
industry regulations that are dictating

222
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,080
what has to happen when it comes to

223
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,560
these types of assessments

224
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,600
so keep that in mind

225
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,760
and again one of the things that i do

226
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,720
want to call out

227
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,839
if there are any questions

228
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,640
we are going to have the volunteer help

229
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,120
with

230
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
fielding those towards the end but feel

231
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,920

sure to

235
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,519
at me infosec war and

236
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,560
if we don't get to the questions and

237
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,600
able to complete them all during this

238
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,560
session

239
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,920
i will go to discord and make sure that

240
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,720
i answer

241
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
all of your questions today that's my

242
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,279
commitment to you

243
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,720
all right so moving on uh

244
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,360
setting up and creating your cyber

245
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,000
security

246
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,240
incident response team so uh but

247
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,279
before we get into the specifics

248
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,640
of creating your first surf team or

249
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,440
maybe a reforming your searching based

250
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,160
on

251
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
some of the things you learned today

252
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,399
let's discuss just a minute

253
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,760
the criticality of having executive

254
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,279
sponsorship because it

255
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,560
is so important this doesn't matter

256
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,839
if you're a fortune 500 or you're a

257
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,360
security team of just

258
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
one you're going to have to have some

259
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,800
form

260
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
of executive sponsorship before you can

261
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,160
start

262
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,120
down the path of an incident response

263
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
program because that

264
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
executive sponsor will approve

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,240
hopefully in addition to some budget for

266
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,279
you and

267
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,720
being able to do this but they're going

268
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,839
to approve

269
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,839
your mission statement and we're going

270
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,880
to talk about that

271
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,320
next uh the roles

272
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,360
that we'll discuss as well

273
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,440
here in just a few minutes but also

274
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,760
prioritizing

275
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,200
the threats and assign threat

276
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,720
levels to attacks or

277
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
potential attacks against your

278
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,600
organization so this person is

279
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,160
typically of the cio or cso class

280
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,720
and will approve moving between phases

281
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,680
of an incident response so you're gonna

282
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,959
have to have

283
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,320
those uh or

284
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
have that support from

285
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,399
an executive sponsor that has the

286
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,399
authority

287
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,120
to implement these changes approve

288
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,800
budget as well as

289
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
handle the critical decision making

290
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,959
that goes into your incident response

291
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,560
all right so next hopefully

292
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,720
being besides sa um

293
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,079
satx i should say san antonio texas

294
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,680
my current location um

295
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,720
hopefully you guys recognize the alamo

296
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,440
here but

297
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,120
it was obviously a uh

298
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,079
a mission before that so let's talk

299
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,000
about the mission statement that i

300
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
have mentioned earlier you know this is

301
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,160
basically

302
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,240
a unifying mission statement that can

303
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,720
help

304
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,760
ensure everyone on the team

305
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,600
understands the why of what's happening

306
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
here

307
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,839
you know simon setnick uh talks about

308
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,519
the significance of the

309
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,680
why and i'm doing air quotes for those

310
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,959
that may just be

311
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,000
listening and not seeing the video here

312
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
but the why in what we do

313
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
in particular particularly

314
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,680
when it comes to incident response now

315
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,959
i've linked to

316
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,480
simon's ted talk in my speaker notes and

317
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,200
uh you'll be able to download that today

318
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,760
and

319
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,160
listen to is i want to say it's a short

320
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,120
you know 15

321
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
16 minutes ted talk and i'll have that

322
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,199
linked in the deck but

323
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,600
you know be sure you understand the why

324
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
and that you're able to communicate that

325
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:51,839
your

326
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
mission statement doesn't have to be a

327
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,199
dissertation though

328
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,399
you know it could be as simple as

329
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,320
something like the mission

330
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
of xyz corp is to rapidly and

331
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,519
effectively address

332
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
all cyber security incidents with a

333
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,720
well-vetted response plan that reduces

334
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,480
our organizational risk

335
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,440
and protects our shareholders whoever

336
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,480
they may be

337
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,760
right uh the important thing is

338
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,240
that you have one that is collectively

339
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,199
agreed upon

340
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,959
and signed off by your executive sponsor

341
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,000
um and again i'll have simon's talk

342
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
about the importance of why

343
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,199
in my talk notes and you'll be able to

344
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,079
download

345
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,360
that immediately after this so

346
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,279
when it comes to roles to assign

347
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,880
um boy those look good i have an eight

348
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,760
today

349
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,199
i'm really digging those rolls but

350
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,000
anyhow when it comes to rolls to assign

351
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,680
i'm just gonna throw some of these

352
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
out there and some of them are pretty

353
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,320
obvious the ones that aren't i'll give a

354
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,959
little bit of

355
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,000
talk to you but in the time of

356
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,760
or in the interest of time i want to be

357
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
as brief as possible with these but

358
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,360
you know you're going to need a team

359
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
leader now the team leader is

360
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,320
just that team lead it is not the

361
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,399
executive sponsor you're still going to

362
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,199
need

363
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,880
that cio or cso level uh executive and

364
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,639
if you're a really small company it may

365
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,160
be your ceo

366
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,199
uh i i feel sorry for you if you

367
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
are that security team of one because

368
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
you have a lot of on your shoulders

369
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
and i'm not trying to pile more onto it

370
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
but think about these roles

371
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
because if you are that team of one or

372
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,839
maybe just

373
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,000
a team of one or two you're gonna have

374
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
to take on a lot more burden

375
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,399
than say an enterprise class

376
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,120
organization that has a full security

377
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,399
team and

378
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,079
other departments that they can pull

379
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,639
from but we have our team lead we have

380
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,759
our cso

381
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,279
or cio caliber risk manager

382
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,959
is one uh that may be in that executive

383
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,600
suite

384
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,199
that you need to pull from same thing

385
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,040
with a privacy officer

386
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,240
if you have a data privacy officer

387
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
legal counsel cannot get away from

388
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
having legal counsel

389
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,800
whether that's internal or external you

390
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
have to have legal representation

391
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,880
same thing with hr uh customer service

392
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,639
if you're in that kind of

393
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,000
uh situation where you do have a large

394
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
customer service organization you're

395
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,320
gonna need some representative from them

396
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,720
because if this does go public if it is

397
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,240
that kind of incident

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
you're surely going to see an uptick in

399
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
customer service calls or

400
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,320
emails that are going to have to be

401
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,839
handled so make sure you have a

402
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,240
representative for customer service

403
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
and that you're providing them

404
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
information on a need to know basis they

405
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
do not need to know everything because

406
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,519
again they're going to be communicating

407
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,440
with the public and that can get

408
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,959
very dangerous be sure whatever you do

409
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,199
provide to your customer service agents

410
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
or their representative

411
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,119
that it has been cleared by legal

412
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,400
counsel and

413
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,240
your executive sponsor finance

414
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,280
may need to be involved and i think in

415
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,959
light of recent events with ransomware

416
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
payments being made which i am not a

417
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,079
proponent of

418
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,359
i'll be very clear about that i have my

419
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
reasons and if you want to get into the

420
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,039
debate of whether or not to

421
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,240
pay ransomware demands

422
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,320
let's take that offline but i'll be more

423
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,280
than happy to

424
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,280
have that debate with you politely

425
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,320
um finance may need to be involved uh

426
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,520
there may be

427
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,400
budgets being spent on incident response

428
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,440
handlers

429
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
external resources that you need to

430
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
bring in i'm gonna talk

431
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,880
specifically to those later on

432
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,120
they definitely will need to be involved

433
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
if you're making a

434
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,679
ransomware payment um but be sure you

435
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,960
have finance involved business

436
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
continuity if you have a business

437
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,360
continuity unit within your organization

438
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,559
you need their participation

439
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,840
we've already talked about the executive

440
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,880
sponsor i.t

441
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
without a doubt needs to be involved in

442
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,400
your cert

443
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,919
team as well as a dpo

444
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,960
if you have a data protection officer

445
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,480
they're going to need to be involved

446
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
typically because it involves data

447
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,640
breaches data leaks

448
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,280
uh you know double extortion schemes

449
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,320
you name it um so be sure your

450
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
gpo if you do have one that they're a

451
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,080
part of your cert team

452
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
again any questions on these you know

453
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,640
feel free to hit me up in discord but

454
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,600
those are the most common groups that i

455
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,400
do see

456
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,919
participating in cert team structures

457
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,080
and um for different purposes and cause

458
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,440
now again if you're a 102 person

459
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,840
security team you're gonna have to

460
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
assume some of these responsibilities

461
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,480
on your own without the support of

462
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
obviously it goes to parties

463
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,960
excuse me just wetting my whistle

464
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,080
all right moving on to establishing

465
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,000
communication channels now

466
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,919
this is different than a communication

467
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,520
plan which we'll discuss

468
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,120
next but com channels are

469
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,280
basically those bilateral calm feeds

470
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,559
that we're likely

471
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,799
going to need to help with our serve

472
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,840
team efforts and these may

473
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,120
include you know inbound threat

474
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,080
intelligence

475
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
fees whether those are open or closed

476
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,160
source so you can get

477
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,640
threat intel fees that you can subscribe

478
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
to

479
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,799
or free feeds that fit into things like

480
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,240
sticks and taxi

481
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
so that you can have a free threat

482
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
intelligence platform or a tip

483
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
as they're commonly referred to or you

484
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
can subscribe to feeds you know

485
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,679
um i don't want to throw any vendor

486
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,679
names out there but there are

487
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,360
you know several predominant feeds

488
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,640
that these vendors provide

489
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,400
and they're basically just going to

490
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,880
supply you with indicators of compromise

491
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,159
that will help you

492
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,440
understand if your company or your

493
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,240
industry

494
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,600
are likely targets for an ongoing

495
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,039
cyber attack that's going on in the wild

496
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
you may also want to participate in

497
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,799
these as an outbound

498
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,240
supplier of iocs maybe

499
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,520
in a closed loop with others

500
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,559
within your industry

501
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,200
or sector vertical sector um

502
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
you know to be able to help one another

503
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,480
protect

504
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,720
and defend it's kind of a closed source

505
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
think of it like a networking right

506
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
everybody trusts

507
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
everybody everybody shares information

508
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,440
business guards

509
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,080
are being swapped you share best

510
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
practices with each other that kind of

511
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,039
stuff it's the same thing

512
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,559
except with the threat intelligence uh

513
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,440
of indicators of compromise that are

514
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,840
being shared between these

515
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
organizations you may also need to set

516
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,000
up internal distribution lists that

517
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,960
receive

518
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,880
inbound notifications

519
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
or to be able to share information

520
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,320
amongst

521
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,520
yourselves on the serp team about

522
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,320
different security elements whatever it

523
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,600
may be and of course

524
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
if there is some kind of cyber security

525
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,919
incident you may be using that

526
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,120
internal distribution list as a way to

527
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,559
communicate

528
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,760
and then there's also regulatory

529
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,240
authorities

530
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,799
that may have their own ways of

531
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,559
communicating with those that are

532
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,679
subject to

533
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,400
their directives so you'll want to look

534
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
at those and see if there's any

535
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,440
types of you know communication uh

536
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
channels that they have set up whether

537
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,799
it's an rss feed

538
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,240
a tip or threat intelligence platform

539
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,039
feed

540
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,000
something that feeds into sticks or taxi

541
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,320
maybe they have an rss for

542
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,240
you know some blog that they published

543
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
you whatever the case may be but

544
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,280
just look at it and understand what

545
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,480
channels exist

546
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,360
for yourselves

547
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
then there's a need to establish a

548
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,080
backup form

549
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,559
of cert team communications in the event

550
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,240
that your primary

551
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,400
you know phone systems email systems

552
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,200
your slack you know whatever the case

553
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,000
may be

554
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
if those are what has been compromised

555
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,679
you may need to have a backup for those

556
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,240
uh in which case you may want to use

557
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,840
something like a third-party voip system

558
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,039
encrypted device application like signal

559
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,320
sudo slack discord whatever the case may

560
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,480
be as long as that's not the platform

561
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,000
that's been compromised

562
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,320
in your cyber attack okay

563
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,440
so uh creating a communications plan now

564
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,480
this is one of the

565
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,080
the most critical aspects of

566
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,039
the search team besides the actual

567
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,760
responding to

568
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,400
an incident setting up your

569
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
communication plan

570
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,520
is really going to be one of the

571
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,880
successor failures

572
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,440
of how

573
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,080
it is perceived that you have handled

574
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,600
a cyber security incident let's go

575
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,640
back to equifax

576
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,480
you know there's a reason why

577
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,960
there was a change to equifax to

578
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,440
equifs

579
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,200
if you will um during a lot of the

580
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,919
online discussion of how they handled

581
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,080
that cyber security incident

582
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
let's just face it it was a complete

583
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,360
cluster

584
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,640
from the get-go and it all had to do

585
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,480
with how they communicated

586
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,440
what was going on and the back pedaling

587
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,159
and

588
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,320
the multiple story angles and

589
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,840
it was just by far one of the worst

590
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,600
cyber security incidents

591
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,799
that i've ever seen now

592
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,799
in contrast i want to say the

593
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,000
organization was

594
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,120
fox ig that deals with cyber security

595
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,240
and they got breached

596
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,039
themselves as a cyber security

597
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,720
organization

598
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,159
yet the way that they handled theirs

599
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,919
in the communication that they had with

600
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,440
the entire community how transparent

601
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,880
they were throughout the entire process

602
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,159
was amazing they got it

603
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,360
right you want to be one of them you do

604
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,559
not want to be in equifax so

605
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,679
uh assign a 13 communications

606
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,080
officer in a cert team

607
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,200
comms office right that establishes with

608
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,720
authority

609
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,080
let me repeat that with authority

610
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,120
who says what when

611
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,159
and to whom and this includes

612
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,480
things like the media shareholders

613
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
employees

614
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,440
partners customers uh clients

615
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,799
as well as the state federal

616
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,919
and industry regulators and yeah let's

617
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,440
talk about that list

618
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
the fbi the secret service many don't

619
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,720
understand that the secret service do a

620
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
lot of cyber security investigations

621
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,840
um your state attorney's offices

622
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,000
ccpa or the california consumers

623
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
privacy act you know you have to know

624
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,919
not only what regulations are applicable

625
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,960
to you

626
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,039
but you also need to know what the

627
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,080
notification

628
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,520
requirements are for you communicating

629
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,960
to those regulators within their defined

630
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
timeline

631
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
what is going on and how you are

632
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,440
handling

633
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,960
that cyber security incident we see

634
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,159
with california you have 72

635
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,360
hours to report that incident

636
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,240
you know that's not a very long window

637
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,159
same thing with the

638
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,360
uh eu's gdpr

639
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,279
you have a 72-hour window to notify

640
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,720
their um dpo

641
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,919
or dps excuse me new york

642
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,840
dfs part 500 same thing

643
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,959
i think there's

644
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,919
i'm getting confused uh i think theirs

645
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,919
is either 48 or 72

646
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,279
i want to say 72 hours though uh

647
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,919
but they have their own requirements you

648
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,200
know we talked earlier

649
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,320
about the department of homeland

650
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,360
security

651
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,240
which has tsa and tsa and cisa

652
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,320
have to be notified within 12 hours

653
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,039
12 hours you have half a day to get your

654
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,640
 together and let them know what's

655
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,000
going on

656
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,679
that's not a lot of time so you have to

657
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,159
almost have this stuff templatized and

658
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,559
ready to go which is part of

659
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
setting up your communications plan

660
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,159
knowing

661
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,240
how you're going to respond to each of

662
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,279
these or

663
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,720
types of organizations

664
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,240
some of the other things that you'll

665
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,760
want to do as part of your

666
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
communications plan

667
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,279
is conducting mock interviews right and

668
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,880
playing the devil's advocate having

669
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
someone really push

670
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,799
the envelope when it comes to the types

671
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,000
of questions you may be

672
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,440
asked by the press if you're working for

673
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,480
the type of organization that would need

674
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,200
to

675
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,559
go public with this type of uh security

676
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,600
incident

677
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,080
yeah so go through those mock interviews

678
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,960
and

679
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,000
you know let your communications

680
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
officer that's been assigned to the team

681
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,480
really get put to the test on how well

682
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:26,880
they're

683
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
able to handle themselves under the

684
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,320
duress of

685
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,720
three or four people asking this you

686
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
know different questions all at the same

687
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
time because that's how

688
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,559
these press conferences go when i was

689
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,039
with the city of atlanta's ransomware

690
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,440
you know response team yeah the mayor

691
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,399
would sit there

692
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,320
in the middle of the city hall

693
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,039
um entry entryway their forum

694
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,080
and give a press release every day or a

695
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,520
press conference

696
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,000
every day about how they're handling it

697
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,559
and then

698
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,200
it went to legal counsel and cio but

699
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,919
um you know know how you're going to

700
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:08,480
handle

701
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,520
those kinds of interviews

702
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,080
as far as internal and external do's and

703
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,559
don'ts

704
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,720
you know the one thing i i did talk

705
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,240
already about

706
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
customer service and being sure you're

707
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,399
limiting information that

708
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,640
they're provided same thing with

709
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,000
internal employees

710
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,279
it is on a need to know basis um

711
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,600
and it's not that they're not

712
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,559
trustworthy

713
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,159
it's just for company-wide communication

714
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,640
it is need to know basis you want to

715
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
limit the risk

716
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,120
and exposure of potentially

717
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,080
saying the wrong things there was one

718
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,640
incident

719
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,279
involving a financial organization

720
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,440
and a bank teller said the wrong thing

721
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,320
to one of the

722
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,640
customers and next thing you know this

723
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,080
thing's getting blown

724
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,919
way out of proportion and what ended up

725
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,039
getting into the press was not accurate

726
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,880
whatsoever but

727
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
again it's because of company-wide

728
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
communications when it should have been

729
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,679
need to know basis

730
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,559
um

731
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,360
okay uh compromise channels

732
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,919
obviously you have to be careful

733
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,080
in making sure that you understand

734
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,880
the scope of what has

735
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,880
transpired what you're dealing with

736
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
because

737
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,399
the last thing that you want to do is

738
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,679
start having your cert

739
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,159
team talk about how they're handling the

740
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,520
incident response

741
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,640
over a potentially compromised channel

742
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,520
so if you are dealing with an active

743
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,080
attack against your organization

744
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,960
you may want to immediately go to that

745
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,919
fallback communications

746
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,919
network that you've set up whether

747
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,360
that's through

748
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,399
yeah sudo

749
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,320
slack discord whatever app

750
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,799
or service you want to use but you may

751
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,640
want to fall back to that immediately

752
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,519
not knowing

753
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,200
if your email servers or your

754
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,519
voip system whatever has been

755
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,159
compromised

756
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,760
okay incident classes classifications

757
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
and threat levels

758
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
you know this again is really back to

759
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,640
the cio and cso

760
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,159
and the importance of them being able to

761
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,000
assign those threat levels

762
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,840
and knowing based off of that continuous

763
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
um you know risk assessment that you're

764
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
going to do every six

765
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,159
12 months you know they're going to get

766
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,240
to understand these threat levels know

767
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,159
the assignment and as uh incidents start

768
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,200
to occur

769
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,360
particularly if you're having to deal

770
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,480
with multiple

771
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,080
threats simultaneously not only are they

772
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,279
going to be

773
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,440
assigning the threat levels but they're

774
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,480
also going to be

775
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,480
prioritizing the the uh

776
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,320
the responses based off of those threats

777
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,200
so

778
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,799
again all that's based off of the risk

779
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,240
to the organization as perceived

780
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
by that those

781
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,159
now from the executive suite essentially

782
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,480
okay one of my favorite things to talk

783
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,760
about is jump backs

784
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,279
um we have to have these jump backs

785
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,880
ready to go this is basically your

786
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
bug out bag except you don't get to bug

787
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,120
out of this situation you just have to

788
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,480
deal with it right

789
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,679
so this is a physical bag

790
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,679
how many of them exist in your

791
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,840
organization depends on

792
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,480
how big your team is and how often you

793
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,120
want to be

794
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,559
responsible for carrying a bag

795
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,559
and being responsible for its contents

796
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,399
so um you should have at least

797
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,600
two of them one to remain on-site

798
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,720
one to remain off-site with whoever

799
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,600
is the steward of that bag for that

800
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,440
rotation period

801
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,519
uh the stewards are going to be members

802
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,640
of the serp team

803
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,559
they are responsible 24 7 for that bag

804
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,720
if there is a cyber security incident

805
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,399
that means they have to be

806
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,600
on call as well and that's typically the

807
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,000
case

808
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,480
with most of the server team members but

809
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
particularly this one

810
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,840
um and it could be any person on the

811
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,679
team just as long as they're responsible

812
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,760
for the bag and can bring it to wherever

813
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,279
you're going to huddle up

814
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,720
in your physical or virtual war room

815
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,399
the reason you're going to need this bag

816
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,559
is you don't know what the level of

817
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,799
impact is going to be to your

818
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,440
infrastructure within the organization

819
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,799
right so if we're dealing with something

820
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,960
like the city of atlanta's

821
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,399
attack where um now that's public record

822
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:12,719
and

823
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,879
everybody's pretty much been briefed on

824
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,839
what all transpired and it's public

825
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,679
information

826
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,800
um their entire environment was just

827
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,599
toast the sam sam ransomware took it

828
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,000
down

829
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,239
active directory took down workstations

830
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,918
took down servers

831
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,359
it didn't give a flying flip

832
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,119
um so we were starting with nothing

833
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,239
my badge which i wish i had brought it

834
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,119
out here

835
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,320
to show you guys uh it had to be

836
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,340
printed off like a uh

837
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,199
[Music]

838
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,679
not a dot matrix a color inkjet printer

839
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,960
it's a horrible looking badge but

840
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,720
then they use one of those lamination

841
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,800
kits that you can go into office depot

842
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,079
and buy

843
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,079
that was my badge for like the first

844
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,839
week to get around

845
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,720
this completely lockdown city hall and

846
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,839
everything

847
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,280
uh so you're going to want some of the

848
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,760
contents of this jump bag to be

849
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,400
immediately available day one hard copy

850
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,880
of your

851
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,760
incident response plan documents uh

852
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,200
network cables

853
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,520
notebooks and pens you know you may not

854
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,400
be able to

855
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,200
take notes on normal computers you may

856
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,280
have to go back to pen and paper

857
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,480
usb storage devices digital cameras you

858
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,440
know we had to

859
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,400
use little digital cameras to take

860
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
people's photos

861
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,680
print them off on a portable printer

862
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,599
scanner which is one of the other items

863
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,520
that should be in your jump bag

864
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,880
and then scissor cut the image and paste

865
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,240
it onto

866
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,400
that badge before we use a little

867
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,599
lamination kits

868
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,359
you're going to need this kind of stuff

869
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,680
digital camera sound recorder

870
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,280
uh you may want to use that for

871
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,440
note-taking may want to use it for

872
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,599
meeting records etc

873
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,440
uh we talked about the portable printer

874
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
scanner fully patched

875
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,480
laptop and a tablet to walk around with

876
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,240
you're also going to need an iphone

877
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
preferably for

878
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,680
added security or just a burner device

879
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,880
but there needs to be

880
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,160
a charged ready-to-use phone fully

881
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,200
patched laptop

882
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,320
tablet portable printer scanner etc

883
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
you get it that's your jump back there

884
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,440
should be two

885
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,240
one on-site one off-site stewards are

886
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,520
on-call

887
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,160
7 ready to jump with that

888
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,920
tabletop exercises another great

889
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,200
great use of your cirque team's time

890
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,400
um you know creating and sourcing

891
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,880
exercises for you guys to go through

892
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,680
doesn't have to be a heavy lifting

893
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,320
i've done the effort of searching for

894
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,040
and

895
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,320
linking five different sets

896
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,599
of tabletop exercises that are in

897
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,880
my speaker notes of the slide deck so

898
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,920
you'll have those uh you can also just

899
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,079
google for them or actually go for them

900
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,200
and just look for cyber security plus

901
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,920
you know tabletop exercises that's how i

902
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
found all these

903
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,440
um you can also look for amanda berlin

904
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,560
on youtube she's got a great

905
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,160
couple of videos on tabletop exercises

906
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,960
there

907
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,440
now the frequency and duration of these

908
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,160
it's going to be

909
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,599
up to you guys to decide but

910
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,640
normally you want to do let's say one a

911
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,599
month

912
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,160
and keep them short you know 15 to 30

913
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,359
minutes each

914
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,200
you know you're wanting to think through

915
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
the purpose and intent

916
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,520
of the exercise look at some of those

917
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,560
that i've provided

918
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,880
in the speaker notes um come up with

919
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,280
your own but try to keep them short so

920
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,160
it's not this

921
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
daunting task and arduous heavy lifting

922
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,200
that your team has to go through you

923
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
want them to be excited you want them to

924
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
have fun with this

925
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,680
being engaged and you know

926
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,760
participating in it you don't want this

927
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,359
to be a dreadful

928
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,760
kind of thing it should be fun it should

929
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,440
be

930
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,560
uh i guess thought provoking those kinds

931
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
of things but

932
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,280
also be sure as

933
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,240
you're doing these tabletop exercises as

934
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,079
you learn things about yourselves

935
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,040
your team your organization and your

936
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,280
cyber resiliency

937
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,440
update your cyber security incident

938
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,160
response plan to reflect those lessons

939
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,079
learned

940
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,800
okay um getting close on time here

941
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,560
preserving digital for run six

942
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,440
let's talk about this so really when it

943
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,160
comes to handling the digital forensics

944
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,839
of a cyber attack against your company

945
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,200
there really really is a need to engage

946
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,880
a specialist for this so

947
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,160
if you don't have a certified

948
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,160
dfir expert in-house you're definitely

949
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
going to want to consult with one early

950
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,680
on

951
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,800
in your cert effort so you have them

952
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,040
um ready to go if you do get hit by an

953
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,920
attack many of them will actually

954
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,960
conduct a free

955
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,480
or you know sometimes paid workshop

956
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,520
just to help get your retainer

957
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,079
to keep them you know on the ready so

958
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,960
feel free to ask them about that even if

959
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,839
it's not publicly stated on their sites

960
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,760
um now one of the things that i want to

961
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
call out when it comes to preserving

962
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,200
your digital forensics you know

963
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,800
something not to do

964
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,960
is and i know the knee jerk reaction is

965
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,200
to shut down all systems

966
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,400
but really it's best to try to be land

967
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,359
or segment

968
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,560
your compromise systems or you know

969
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,839
disconnect their land cables or turn off

970
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,000
their wi-fi signals so that you can

971
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,560
preserve as much of that physical

972
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,520
evidence as possible while still

973
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,440
containing the malware and

974
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,240
not allowing it to spread but keep that

975
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,200
in mind that

976
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,359
as soon as you shut down these systems

977
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,400
they start to

978
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,160
lose the digital forensics particularly

979
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
stuff that may be still resident

980
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,599
in memory okay

981
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,960
uh last bit and we're

982
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,520
fixing our wrap up so i know we're just

983
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,680
a couple minutes over time here but

984
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,640
engaging outsiders talked about that a

985
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,000
little bit earlier

986
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,119
and there are

987
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,359
many outside experts that you may need

988
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,160
to

989
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,000
call in as part of your incentive

990
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,680
response and as

991
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,880
valuable as as folks are the

992
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,440
time to build those relationships and

993
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,000
formalize contract agreements and stuff

994
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,200
is not during a cyber security incident

995
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,119
you know um it's best to shortlist

996
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,720
your top prospects well ahead

997
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,560
of an attack game get those agreements

998
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,240
redlined and executed you know early on

999
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,720
so that they're on retainer and ready to

1000
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,680
go

1001
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,920
sometimes you know that's going to

1002
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,560
involve paying that retainer fee but

1003
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,040
knowing the likelihood of an attack is

1004
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,000
you know very

1005
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,560
likely you're gonna have to just make

1006
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,280
that call

1007
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,319
on your own um but some of the

1008
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,839
outside sorry um

1009
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,720
what happened there

1010
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,280
there we go um some of the outsiders

1011
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,599
may include insurance carriers you know

1012
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,599
your cyber security insurance

1013
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,200
they're going to need to be engaged

1014
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,319
early on outside legal counsel if that's

1015
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,440
necessary forensics investigators

1016
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,040
your regulators you know 12 to 72 hours

1017
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,880
not a whole lot of time

1018
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,040
law enforcement agencies we talked about

1019
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,200
those earlier

1020
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,319
uh crisis communications or a pr firm if

1021
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,280
you're

1022
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,040
dealing with a customer centric

1023
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,520
type of attack where data's been leaked

1024
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,720
and those kinds of things you're

1025
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,880
probably going to need to have a crisis

1026
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,040
communications company or pr

1027
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,119
firm engaged response vendors simply to

1028
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,040
stand up the environment we had

1029
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,400
six different response vendors as part

1030
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,880
of the

1031
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,800
city of atlanta's response

1032
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
can't disclose who those are right now

1033
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,000
but you know

1034
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,920
keep in mind you're going to need those

1035
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,280
as well and

1036
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,480
other third parties as needed so

1037
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,160
you know make sure you've got those

1038
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,359
contracts set up retainers established

1039
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,079
teams ready to go so that if you get hit

1040
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,760
you can start dialing

1041
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,400
you know those numbers again those folks

1042
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,839
engaged

1043
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,599
all right folks uh we're a couple

1044
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,079
minutes over i do apologize for that

1045
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,560
okay so one of the questions asks do you

1046
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,319
believe that enterprises lack a way to

1047
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,319
share information after attack what can

1048
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,440
we use to solve this

1049
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,800
issue if this is one yes that is

1050
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,839
a big big issue

1051
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,480
a way for organizations to say

1052
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,400
in a redacted form an anonymous form

1053
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,520
what happened how they were hit

1054
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,440
you know what systems were targeted

1055
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,480
and what their response was anything

1056
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,599
that i've seen if

1057
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,640
anybody else is aware of a resource like

1058
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,560
that that would allow

1059
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,319
for organizations to

1060
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,200
freely share redacted information or

1061
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,160
anonymous

1062
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,000
information about how they got hacked

1063
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,359
by cyber criminals hacking is not a

1064
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,920
crime

1065
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,240
i get it let me just talk

1066
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,118
but um

1067
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,280
i don't know if anybody knows anything

1068
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:50,800
pop it into discord or to chat here

1069
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,079
alonzo saying why not use usrt um

1070
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,640
you know that's fine for disclosing to

1071
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,119
them

1072
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,160
i think the question is more sharing

1073
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,680
openly with the community and

1074
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,000
the level of details that would be

1075
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,079
required

1076
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,520
i'm not sure that's a good fit

1077
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,400
i appreciate everybody's time today and

1078
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,119
