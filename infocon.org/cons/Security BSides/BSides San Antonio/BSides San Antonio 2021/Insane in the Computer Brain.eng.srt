1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,440
welcome to track two and this is the

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,000
last

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,639
session of the day uh we have eric

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,080
landmine

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,120
aka eric lansbury uh

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,720
talk insane in the computer brain

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,320
however before we proceed

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,160
i've been asked to make an announcement

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,320
uh please make sure to visit david's

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
legacy channel

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
they're a non-profit to help kids who

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,880
are uh

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
who have ongoing cyber bullying uh

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
the organization was created after david

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,200
took his life

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,120
and and too many kids take their lives

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,640
to these online attacks

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
you can help out no matter where you are

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,800
in the world with uh tech education

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,480
and and you can help save a life so go

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,360
ahead and check them out in discord

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,559
let me introduce eric real quick eric is

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,399
currently serving as the manager of

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,840
technical services

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,079
at cso llc a pittsburgh based

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,960
cybersecurity

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,920
governance risk and compliance company

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,160
he's known by eric landmine via twitter

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
and he runs owns and operates the

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
red up security podcast he's besides

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,520
pittsburgh organizer

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,840
long time fan and long time attendee of

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,880
various

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,680
b-sides conferences so if we were live

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,040
i'd say put your hands together but you

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,320
can do it anyway at home

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
without further ado uh here is eric's

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,040
presentation

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,560
everyone thanks for coming to my talk

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
and seeing in the computer brain

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
my name is eric lanesbury also known as

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,159
eric landmine

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
via twitter i run the red up security

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
podcast which is a pittsburgh infosight

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,880
people based podcast where i interview

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,479
various professionals in the infosec

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,920
field that have connections to

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,119
pittsburgh or currently work in the

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
pittsburgh field

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,360
um also organizer at the b-sides

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,240
pittsburgh event

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,680
which will be having our event in

53
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,399
october of this year and also i am the

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,920
manager of technical services

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
overseeing all the red blue application

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,360
security teams for

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,479
cso cso is a cyber security firm

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,320
information security firm and we have

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,640
tons of red blue and grc services

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,040
available

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,360
so what is this presentation why are you

62
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,399
guys here

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
what what got you interested in this uh

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,000
this type of talk

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,038
uh some of the things that we'll be

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,879
talking about here is the human mind the

67
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,239
computer brain connection

68
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,319
and basically the similarities between

69
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,920
how computers were designed and how the

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,599
human mind actually operates it's kind

71
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,160
of

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
uncanny so to speak this is a collection

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
of my own research

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,920
and there are some very conceptual

75
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,000
abstract based theories

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
that i have that we'll be talking about

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,160
today um and i'm always open to feedback

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
and new ideas in this space so feel free

79
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,760
to reach out and

80
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
give me some feedback on this stuff um

81
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,959
it's really

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,319
really about that last line there how

83
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,840
it's not so weird that the computer

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,480
systems

85
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
that we have in operation and are

86
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
designed to basically people

87
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
because people design them so what this

88
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,040
presentation is not

89
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
um we are not going to be talking about

90
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
ai we're not going to be getting in

91
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,040
depth with

92
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
machine learning we're not going to be

93
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
doing any analyzing of how

94
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,800
current ai or algorithms are currently

95
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
working so

96
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
uh if this is not the doc for you then

97
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
maybe i'll spin off an ai based one and

98
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
maybe i'll even have a human adaptive or

99
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,040
assistance

100
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
technologies one that could be

101
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,319
definitely interesting

102
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
future opportunities

103
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
so let's start out just by talking about

104
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,560
the the glaring similarities between

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
any kind of computer system design and

106
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,799
the human brain

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,959
uh so you can see based on this image

108
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,799
that's provided by the ketamine

109
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,640
institute which has a really good study

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
on these similarities in the left

111
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,799
showing hemisphere you have here you

112
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,280
have

113
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,760
your basic computer operating system is

114
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,560
included

115
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
windows or sx you have your memory

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
you have programs that run and you may

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,519
have some

118
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,200
diseases or viruses you know some

119
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,560
programs or things that are

120
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
kind of stuck there on the right

121
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,560
hemisphere of this photo here you see

122
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
the typical brain the operating system

123
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,239
has its default mode network

124
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,200
and we're going to talk about the

125
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
systems that are involved there on the

126
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,000
next slide

127
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
and it also has short-term long-term

128
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
memory and

129
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
different types of behaviors that it

130
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,239
reacts to based on context and those

131
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,280
sorts of things

132
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
also has diseases right so the

133
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
common computer virus is very similar in

134
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
a lot of a lot of ways to

135
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,399
the human diseases and syndromes that

136
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,638
occur

137
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,880
so in this slide we're going to talk

138
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
about the systems of the mind and

139
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,919
you can boil it down to two systems that

140
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,000
are available within the human mind and

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
one is system one which is typically

142
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,199
fast thinking

143
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,919
it's continuously scanning the area

144
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,280
receiving context

145
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
receiving information and attempting to

146
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,800
process that information

147
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,919
on in a very quick manner so it's very

148
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,800
error-prone

149
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,520
in that regard and because it works

150
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,759
pretty automatically and effortlessly

151
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,080
it tends to pull in shortcuts and it

152
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,800
tends to

153
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
look for information and data within the

154
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
rest of the brain system

155
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,639
in order to process that particular

156
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,919
event or that context

157
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,639
so again it becomes very error prone

158
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,720
it's also really based on experience and

159
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,919
experience in this case

160
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,479
in the system in system one means belief

161
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,000
so if you experience it

162
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
you typically believe it whereas the

163
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
opposite might might be the effect if

164
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,039
you have not experienced it or something

165
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,240
you're not seeing

166
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
you might not believe it in the system

167
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
system two on the other hand is more for

168
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,960
the

169
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
the slow thinking process the very

170
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
methodic processes it takes a little bit

171
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
more effort for

172
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
the brain to be able to analyze

173
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
information and solve more complex

174
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,960
problems

175
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
but it also exercises self-control

176
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
really well requires

177
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
logic and justification of the context

178
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
and evidence that it's receiving

179
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
in order to make some some better longer

180
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
term decisions

181
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
so you might say that some people have

182
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
more of a system one brain some people

183
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
have more of the system to brain but in

184
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
reality

185
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
these two systems coincide and sometimes

186
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,759
they compete but sometimes they also

187
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,639
provide

188
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,199
um really actual items that make things

189
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,080
just better

190
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
in the long term very similar to how

191
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,440
computers may have different systems

192
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,400
processing data

193
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
more quickly through different parts of

194
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
the operating system versus

195
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
more slowly so they can methodically

196
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
retrieve information

197
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
such as like long-term archival and

198
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
storage which we'll talk about

199
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
the next slide i have here is more of a

200
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
theoretical slide

201
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,840
i commonly use and think in spaces of

202
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,560
the different

203
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,319
protection rings that are available and

204
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,919
designed into computers so

205
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,120
kind of took a stab at what a human

206
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,840
brain

207
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
relates to in terms of the different

208
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
rings in a protection ring

209
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,319
and the focus here could be on like ring

210
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,080
zero ring zero being the near

211
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,960
neocortex it's generating signals it's

212
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,680
creating

213
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,160
um communications to actually interface

214
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,199
with things

215
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
down the road ring one and ring two so

216
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
that it can

217
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
integrate with things like the brain

218
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
stem and the spinal cord and then send

219
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,919
those signals out to the rest of the

220
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,440
nervous system

221
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
one thing i was also thinking about was

222
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
ring three in terms of applications

223
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
uh and i i generalized generally take

224
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,639
this and say

225
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,199
what is the direct correlation between a

226
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,080
computer design

227
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,120
application such as user experience user

228
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,080
interface

229
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
and what cognitive function a human

230
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,759
brain might actually be able to

231
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,479
interact with those ux ui it's pretty

232
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,759
typical that if you have a

233
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,120
really complicated ui uh scenario that

234
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,400
the human brain is not going to be able

235
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
to interface with it well and it's not

236
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
going to be able to send

237
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
the proper signals to be able to um

238
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
operate and communicate with it

239
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,479
throughout the rest of your

240
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,639
nervous system you can also think of

241
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
things like mind mapping software mind

242
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
mapping software is literally designed

243
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,599
uh to exercise your thought process and

244
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,080
that is probably more system two

245
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,759
in the brain that's actually trying to

246
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,160
get data on to something that's visual

247
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,759
and as you're creating that

248
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
visualization your brain is starting to

249
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,919
retrieve different information

250
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,560
and improve that map that's going

251
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,800
through

252
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,440
all right so sorting uh sorting is

253
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,680
probably one of my favorite topics to

254
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,400
think about

255
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
and definitely one of the more

256
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,520
eye-opening things

257
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
uh when you consider the thing the when

258
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
you consider the tasks of sorting and

259
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
how a computer sorts versus our human

260
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,879
sorts

261
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
humans definitely sort objects and

262
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,080
information whether or not

263
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
they know they're doing it on a

264
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
day-to-day basis and the prime example

265
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
is moving from one house to another when

266
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,440
you

267
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,199
are moving from one house to another one

268
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
place to another you take all of your

269
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,080
things

270
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,599
in each of your rooms that are already

271
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,599
sorted by the way and you put them in

272
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,399
boxes

273
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
and then on those boxes you put the name

274
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,958
of the room and now you have your

275
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
your objects your data sorted into those

276
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,000
boxes

277
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
with some sort of index so that you can

278
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,599
take them to the next place

279
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,080
and know what's in the actual box now

280
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
not everybody does this

281
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
some people will just take everything

282
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
throw it into a box

283
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,320
and then figure out what they need to do

284
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
once they get onto the other side

285
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,279
i however really prefer prefer organized

286
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,080
sorting so

287
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,519
i want to make it as efficient as

288
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,760
possible i want to put my objects into a

289
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
box label that box

290
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
and then when i get to the other side i

291
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
want to open that box in the room

292
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
that it's recommended for that it's

293
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,320
required to be opened in

294
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
and then put those objects on the

295
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,920
shelves such as you know

296
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
utensils in a kitchen i don't want my

297
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,760
utensils to end up in my bedroom where i

298
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,279
have to now take them

299
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,800
and then move them into the kitchen

300
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
that's an extra step for me

301
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
so sorting is is super important and

302
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
computers they all sort

303
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
right and it's a little bit more obvious

304
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,080
in how they sort data

305
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
and processes and electrical signals

306
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,600
going through but

307
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
it's a direct correlation it's exactly

308
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
the same so when you start to think

309
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,440
about

310
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
how a computer might sort data and sort

311
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
processes and programs

312
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,279
then you realize you're doing it on a

313
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,839
day-to-day basis in your daily lives

314
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,720
so the question might be do we sort

315
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,519
based on

316
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,519
how computer sort or computer sort based

317
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,640
on how we sort

318
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
it's interesting and how can it be

319
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
improved if computers are sorting the

320
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,359
way that we sort

321
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,839
so the sorting and data retrieval

322
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,160
actually tie together the storage and

323
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
archival

324
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
of data either active storage or

325
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,519
long-term storage

326
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,079
and retrieval have a direct correlation

327
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,120
to how you're sorting

328
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,680
that data and the human brain has its

329
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,920
long-term memory and short-term memory

330
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,160
and sometimes you might think about

331
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
something you might learn something

332
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
that sticks and your system too is

333
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,279
trying to retrieve it

334
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,640
it's really trying to think logically

335
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
about what that data is that you

336
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
stored for whatever period of time maybe

337
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,959
it's three years ago you had this memory

338
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
and you learned something and was stuck

339
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,240
in your brain for that period of time

340
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,720
but now it's three years from then and

341
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,160
you're in conversation with someone you

342
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,720
just can't

343
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
you just can't seem to retrieve that

344
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
thought you know you just can't reach

345
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
down into that system two

346
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,640
and start to retrieve long-term data

347
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
that's been archived for some period of

348
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
time

349
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,839
that's pretty common now there is a few

350
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,720
studies and a few

351
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,880
theories out there that say you never

352
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,480
actually lose memories

353
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,399
they may be damaged they may be harder

354
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,680
to retrieve

355
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,320
or they may be something that could be

356
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,399
literally wiped away based on injury or

357
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,600
that sort of thing but

358
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
technically they don't actually go away

359
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
they just get much harder to retrieve

360
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
over the years so if you think about

361
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,000
different exercises you might be able to

362
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,800
do

363
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,000
to exercise your system to exercise your

364
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
system two side of the brain

365
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,560
and more quickly retrieving information

366
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,839
then when you're in that conversation

367
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,959
you won't feel like you're stumbling

368
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,079
over your words and

369
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,279
you know starting to think about the

370
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,959
data that you did three or four years

371
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,760
ago

372
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,279
now the computer brain side of things

373
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,959
the computer function side of things

374
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,120
you might think that uh something like

375
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,079
indexing

376
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,200
is very important here because there's

377
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,160
a ton of data right there's way more

378
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,360
data

379
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,399
arguably than could be in any one brain

380
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,839
but maybe you can do that i don't know

381
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,760
maybe you have that capability maybe we

382
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,480
all do

383
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
however there's a lot of data that a

384
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
computer system has to be able to

385
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,480
retrieve

386
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,519
and has to retrieve it very quickly

387
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,839
so things like indexing are important

388
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
things like indexing or concept that

389
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,639
help with that quick retrieval and

390
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
sorting as well

391
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
you could also think of caching

392
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,920
information that goes into

393
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
a cached area can be cleaned but it can

394
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
also be stored

395
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,839
if it's safe for long term

396
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,079
now fear is an interesting concept um

397
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,440
that i was thinking about here and this

398
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
is a little bit more conceptual

399
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
a little bit more abstract than some of

400
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,279
the other thoughts that we had here but

401
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,519
fear in the human brain is essentially

402
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,040
based on some sort of

403
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,240
trauma some event occurs and then

404
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
it is processed in the brain as

405
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,000
something that is either

406
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
a threat or something that you need to

407
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
run away from

408
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
your brain needs to figure out how to

409
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
discern between whether or not that fear

410
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,240
is actually safe or you know

411
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
is something that they need to run away

412
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,519
from or fight that fight or flight you

413
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,959
know there's different cues that will

414
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,839
occur

415
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
throughout the process of being exposed

416
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,440
to something that creates fear

417
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,320
originally

418
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,800
and then you revisit it at a later time

419
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
we don't want this to be technophobia we

420
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
want everybody to

421
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,399
be able to use technology in in its

422
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,920
regards on everything that's going on so

423
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
don't be afraid of technology

424
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,959
we'll talk we'll talk more about that in

425
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,200
the pop culture section

426
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,440
now on the computer brain side of things

427
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,800
you could

428
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,320
make an argument that the removal of

429
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,360
fear the removal of trauma through new

430
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,720
events and new patterns

431
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,880
is actually really good for security and

432
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
i did put ai there said i wasn't going

433
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,079
to talk about aei but this is the only

434
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,920
time that i'm going to talk about it

435
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
is that if you have a function that can

436
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,519
actually relearn

437
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,920
and remove vulnerabilities from systems

438
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,560
in terms of

439
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,240
attack paths and those sorts of things

440
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
then you're improving security

441
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,240
so at first it might be a fear it might

442
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,279
be something that

443
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,880
you don't know about or something that

444
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
has been exposed to a system that's

445
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,920
actually caused damage

446
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
but over time if there's patching and

447
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,680
fixing that goes on with that

448
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,600
then your vulnerabilities decrease and

449
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,959
you've improved security

450
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,199
so you're actually removing that fear to

451
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,680
removing that trauma from the system

452
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,160
that's very similar in that regard any

453
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,839
new threats can be adapted to

454
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,279
reacted to and and fixed and

455
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,000
protected against so this this thought

456
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,920
or this process of fear that's common in

457
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,959
the human brain

458
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,880
is also common in the computer brain

459
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
it's just that the computer

460
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
has a little bit of a better time

461
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,600
dealing with those in adapting to the

462
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,560
different scenarios

463
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,639
all right so let's talk a little bit

464
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,040
about pop culture references

465
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,279
and one of my favorite movies short

466
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,560
circuit we're going to talk about this

467
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,120
now

468
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
um so johnny five if you're familiar

469
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,959
with the movie short circuit you know

470
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,760
that

471
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
number five was developed originally as

472
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
a weapon for the military

473
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,199
he is then struck by lightning

474
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,279
throughout the movie and essentially

475
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,120
his program is realigned and he begins

476
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
to develop more human characteristics

477
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
as he's learning and being exposed to

478
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
different contexts

479
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
um outside of the military environment

480
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
so like why are we discussing this

481
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
because it's essentially a robot right

482
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,639
well um at the time of release

483
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,920
socialization of technology was a little

484
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,399
different

485
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,279
and so in the 1980s humans were more

486
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,240
enthusiastic

487
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,399
becoming more enthusiastic about having

488
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,079
technology in their homes

489
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,920
so this along with the release of other

490
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
movies in pop culture like star wars

491
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,240
which had sentient robots and blade

492
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,959
runner

493
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
with their bio-engineered robots it gave

494
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
a real accumulating characteristics to

495
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
some of the technology-based beings

496
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
right

497
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
so it included traits such as like free

498
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,399
thinking sensory reactions

499
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,880
and reflexive learning which all happens

500
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
in your brain

501
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,720
now johnny 5 is a prime example of how

502
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,399
complex responses

503
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,079
reactions to his environments and

504
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,440
advocations occur

505
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
when his computer brain receives input

506
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,199
and then generate he generates a

507
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,079
response which is

508
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,240
ultimately human rather than more

509
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,680
programmatic

510
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
his human brain seems to be developing

511
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,600
pretty well

512
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,920
so there's another johnny johnny demonic

513
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
he plays a key role in the cross between

514
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,040
human brain human activities to direct

515
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,320
design and integration

516
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,279
and usage of his internal computer brain

517
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,880
his storage capacity

518
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,199
so johnny is actually a recipient of a

519
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,279
very poorly designed storage and data

520
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,639
transfer system

521
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,440
with uh only protection rings in mind

522
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
unintended

523
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,880
in summary johnny stores and transfers

524
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
data from point a to point b

525
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,880
and is met with some physical resistance

526
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,639
of those attempting to

527
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,720
obtain said data that he's processed but

528
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,480
that he's holding and scoring

529
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
and moving throughout his uh moving

530
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,920
throughout the movie

531
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,519
but throughout this process he's

532
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,360
required to dump some long-term

533
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,279
memories in order to be the point of

534
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,040
data transfer he actually has to

535
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,639
release some of the things that he's

536
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,040
learned in his long-term storage as

537
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,600
long-term

538
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,440
archival which he's able to retrieve

539
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,920
pretty quickly and be able to remove

540
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,000
in order to store additional data for

541
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,039
his job

542
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,880
so the human brain element that is

543
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
referenced here is how quite poorly this

544
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,799
data transfer method was designed

545
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,919
and if the common practices of how human

546
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
brain utilizes contextual information

547
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,119
and retrieval control

548
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,880
to ensure memories are stored without

549
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,160
overwriting

550
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
in the brain space in order to store new

551
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
information you know if only for

552
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,480
a short period of time so in summary the

553
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,360
giant mnemonic

554
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,559
the movie wow a bit cheeky and a bit fun

555
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,360
to some degree really outlined the fact

556
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,440
that his storage design was poor

557
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,000
his storage design was not reflective of

558
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,760
something of a human brain actual human

559
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,320
brain

560
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
which can store data for long periods of

561
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,320
time without having to

562
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,678
overwrite forcibly

563
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,799
so some more pop culture references

564
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
these are notable mentions

565
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,440
movietron great movie the obvious pieces

566
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,000
to tron

567
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,520
are the direct replications of

568
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,679
human-like activities in the programs

569
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,400
within the

570
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
ancom's cyberspace but each program has

571
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,559
a different disposition

572
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
with regard to handling users so some

573
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,000
will fight for the users

574
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
others consider users bad some are

575
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
simply utilities or data pushers

576
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
these varying program types represent

577
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,760
various human roles too

578
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,640
in society and act upon human-like

579
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
emotions which bingo

580
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
are sourced from the human brain so it

581
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,200
would appear that

582
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
the tron program is actually the movie

583
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
programs that actually have working

584
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
amygdala which generates emotions of

585
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
anger and fear

586
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
as well as the thalamus which is heavy

587
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
and sensory response

588
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,120
so even the hippocampus which plays a

589
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,520
key part in memories is also apparent in

590
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,640
programs like clue

591
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,320
tron and yori there's direct

592
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,760
correlations between

593
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
these programs and using human brain

594
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
interactions with the context

595
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,600
in the sensory applications that go

596
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
throughout the entire movie is great

597
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,080
um eternal sunshine is spotless mind

598
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,120
this is a

599
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,760
another favorite of mine um this is more

600
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,280
psychological than it is

601
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
directly related to the brain but it

602
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
does directly relate to the use of

603
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,000
technology

604
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,600
to identify and alter storage mechanisms

605
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,039
within the human brain

606
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,440
so to start a mapping process occurs

607
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,039
which identifies the bridges between

608
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,679
memories

609
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,919
which need to be addressed in order for

610
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,200
one to actually forget

611
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
about an experience and people seek this

612
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,240
out

613
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,679
physical human brains seek out the

614
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
technology to manage their storage

615
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,200
components

616
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,440
so whether it's whether it's traumatic

617
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,520
or simply unbearable to recall that's

618
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,360
what they're attempting to do here

619
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
so this is this is a notable dimension

620
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,640
due to the need of

621
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
the mapping and memory removals removal

622
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,000
systems to be

623
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,919
well aware of how the brain operates it

624
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,679
needs to function that way so

625
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
it needs to know how pieces of the brain

626
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
operate digging into that system too and

627
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,120
such

628
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,039
and how it may be programmed to

629
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,720
literally carry out that

630
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,679
removal process it must think much like

631
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,280
a human brain in order to be able to do

632
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,880
that

633
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,280
wally one of my kids favorites actually

634
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,720
one of my favorites too

635
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
um the importance of wally's character

636
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,840
arc overall

637
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
was indeed designed to show the

638
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,679
contextual development and intelligence

639
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,159
of a seemingly minuscule type of device

640
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,159
whose literal original purpose was to

641
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,159
only organize and sort rubble

642
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,640
who's sorting you know very human like

643
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,520
nature

644
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
ava's eva's purpose was also similar and

645
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,280
it was to seek out

646
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,799
plant life and return it to the

647
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,640
mothership so these two characters

648
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
develop their human-like output through

649
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
learning of human-based memories

650
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,640
um such as a scene where they are

651
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,440
watching on a tv people dancing

652
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,679
so there are things developed strictly

653
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,360
for human consumption

654
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,039
and are designed to be used by motor

655
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,799
skills sent by the human brain and

656
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,880
wall-e and eva experience these

657
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
and they begin to generate some very

658
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,000
common

659
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
human brain related interactions

660
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,720
so to button this one up some key

661
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,960
takeaways here

662
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,679
computer brain designed by humans so it

663
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,720
has human characteristics by design

664
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
human brain exhibits common

665
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,159
vulnerabilities as

666
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,039
a computer brain it does there's very

667
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,559
interesting ties there

668
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
computers are literally just humans made

669
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,760
of metal in plastic

670
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,480
they need hugs too and obviously if

671
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,720
those computers are fans of heavy metal

672
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,559
i'm a fan of those computers so

673
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,280
all right is my last defacto slide so

674
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,799
how can you find me

675
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,760
my twitter handle is at airplane mine um

676
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
on my road up security podcast is at red

677
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,880
up security

678
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
and you can find me at any permanent

679
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
brothers restaurant near you because

680
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,640
i'm a pittsburgher and i love commanding

681
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,320
sandwiches

682
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,520
thank you hello

683
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
i'm philip wiley the founder of the

684
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,120
homeschool project the palm school

685
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,760
project was founded in june 2018

686
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,640
as a way to offer free education based

687
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
on penetration testing

688
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,880
and ethical hacking to the the public

689
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,039
more specifically

690
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,919
the dallas fort worth area this was

691
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,600
created out of my passion to educate

692
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,559
others

693
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,880
when i was uh before i started teaching

694
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,400
i did a lot of mentoring which

695
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,280
kind of inspired me to go into teaching

696
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,600
and

697
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
you know i was teaching ethical hacking

698
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
at dallas college and some of my

699
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,400
students towards the end of the semester

700
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
the first semester was asking

701
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,559
what where could they take more classes

702
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,840
because they're interested in taking it

703
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,159
but

704
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,559
most people had you know a small budget

705
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,600
for training

706
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,480
so my idea was to get together like on

707
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,159
the weekends and and do some

708
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,360
some little workshops some little

709
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,679
hands-on training to help them further

710
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,000
their education

711
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
so i've decided to go a step further and

712
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
started the pune school project or pawn

713
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,200
school for short

714
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
the pawn school project hosts two

715
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,960
meetings per month

716
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,799
they started out physical meetings back

717
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,400
in 2018

718
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
uh 2019 i started offering the dallas

719
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
meeting streamed so that way it opened

720
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,159
up to

721
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,919
people around the globe to be able to

722
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,799
consume this content and help them

723
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,559
and when the pandemic hit we end up

724
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,000
going uh virtual

725
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,679
with both of the meetings offering two

726
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,120
meetings per month

727
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,840
and we expanded past offensive security

728
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,440
into defensive security

729
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,960
even we had talks on uh becoming a cso

730
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,720
as well as talks on uh becoming a sock

731
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
analyst

732
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,360
another thing unique to phone school

733
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,919
is at least far is the area that that i

734
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,440
live in where phone school was founded

735
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,200
in the dallas fort worth area

736
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,520
is this this meetup was more friendly to

737
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,480
new new people

738
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
trying to get into the industry and we

739
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
tried to take more of an educational

740
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,039
approach

741
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,600
so not only does pwn school stream uh

742
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
monthly meetings

743
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,400
i also teach pen testing and web app pen

744
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,760
testing workshops at different

745
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,000
conferences for different colleges

746
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,440
and for different cyber security groups
