help not only people who are struggling

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,880
when they see

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,079
terrible job descriptions um

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,640
but also help you when you're trying to

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,360
figure out how to advance from one

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,799
specific area

41
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,520
to another business area or break into

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
cyber as many people

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,280
often try to try to figure out how to do

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
a lot of that starts at the job

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
description

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
so for me personally i have moved around

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,080
quite a bit

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
um i have been at nevada

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,959
for uh almost five years

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,040
and again we're going to be i'm going to

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,800
be helping to

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
for federal services very soon

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,239
so yay for that i am a college dropout

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,400
that is relevant to this discussion

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,440
and um started my career

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
in the early 90s started with software

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
development while i went from

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
a front desk person to a software

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,440

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,959
desks

63
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,120
to realizing oh my gosh you know what i

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,319
think i think

65
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,599
building the teams is not just what i'm

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
really good at but it's really fun so

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,959
that i got into recruiting

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,480

74
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,400
many many b-sides and um

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
besides san antonio is accommodating me

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
today

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
uh you're you're watching a pre-recorded

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
talk uh

79
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
i'm actually traveling right now when

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
you see this uh for a family

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
uh thing that i had to do so uh and i

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,599
mentioned to our con just because i love

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
san diego and i love tour fun

84
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,959
so those are a few of the talks i've

85
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
done and

86
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,519
again this one is going to be focused on

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,159
focused on job descriptions i see you

88
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,360
talking about them

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,120
i know it's a problem i know it's

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,840
discouraging i know it's disappointing

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
um let's get through how to turn

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
every time you see a job post into a

93
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
positive experience

94
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,879
and and what to do from there so i will

95
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,360
again

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,319
try to give you examples uh from my

97
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,200
personal

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
uh story and how that could potentially

99
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,879
relate to you

100
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
um how i have frankly

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
gotten jobs i wasn't qualified for

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
including the one i have now

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,880
at least not on paper and hopefully i

104
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
can help you to do the same thing

105
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,759
so the agenda um is going to be okay

106
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,440
once you see this job description um

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
what does that mean for you what should

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
you do what should your plan be it

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,400
should be

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
um how to build your own requirements

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
um a when i say requirements

112
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,160
every job description should be

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
legally should be written in a very

114
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,639
specific way according to

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,080
ofccp you have to the

116
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,040
employer has to break that description

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,639
into

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
what is required as opposed to what is

119
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
preferred every requirement

120
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
should be a measurable quantifiable bona

121
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
fide occupational qualification

122
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
we will talk about how often you will

123
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,000
see

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,320
that they're not giving you good

125
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
qualifications they're mixing up what

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
should be preferred and what should be

127
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,320
required

128
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
um are they giving you

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
judgmental things um that

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
is hard to to quantify and hard for you

131
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,039
to respond to so we'll talk a little bit

132
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,400
about the questions you should ask and

133
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,720
how you can respond to those things that

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
don't make sense

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,199
and i get it you're gonna say wait a

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,639
second

137
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,960
entry level with a cassp and a phd

138
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,039
and 20 years of experience i mean come

139
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,080
on so

140
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,360
listen we will also talk about

141
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
why sometimes it happens yes stupidity

142
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,639
yes

143
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,720
laziness yes sometimes that's the answer

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,759
there's also a couple

145
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,199
other reasons why it happens i'm not

146
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,919
going to spend a lot of time on the why

147
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,520
but i'm going to help you try to get

148
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,919
past that as well

149
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,840
talk about the blockers get you to the

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,600
interview table we want to we want this

151
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,199
discussion to bring you

152
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
from the job ad how that becomes an

153
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
opportunity

154
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,280
for you the project you're gonna do i'm

155
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,199
gonna i'm gonna task you with a little

156
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,960
bit of homework when you see job ads

157
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,319
when you're looking

158
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,800
and this is also going to give some

159
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
pointers again to the employers

160
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,319
who they should be partnering with and

161
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,080
how they should be doing their job posts

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,440
and again how this is going to get you

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,600
to the interview so

164
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,639
think about every job ad that you see

165
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,440
as an opportunity it's going to be a

166
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
little project for you it's not going to

167
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,520
be as

168
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
hard as it sounds i'm not going to make

169
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,319
you into a full-fledged stalker here um

170
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,919
but but there's so much abundance of

171
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,800

197
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720

not i

201
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
don't have to spend the time and the

202
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,599

203
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,240
you can go to google you can go to

204
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,720
linkedin

205
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,759
indeed glassdoor whatever when you see

206
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,720

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,560
that's what i want to do is what i'm

214
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
interested in doing so

215
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
what is the culture of this company look

216
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
like if they're a good company

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
they have recruiting and ops and

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,919
marketing

219
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
all closely partnering with each other

220
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,760
so that they're all on the same page

221
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,399
so that they are doing the right

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,120
messaging

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
to find the right people because let's

224
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,360
face it

225
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
the companies need to hire people they

226
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
need to either sell stuff or they need

227
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
to provide a service

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
and you need people in order to get that

229
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,080
done so

230
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
they should be partnering closely they

231
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,600
should be putting the right messages out

232
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,959
there if you spent

233
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,080
any time on social media uh

234
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,600
over the last couple of months you saw

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,880
an organization that i don't know

236
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,320
if somebody was trying to be cute or

237
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
clever or what they were trying to do

238
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,399
but they put a little survey out and

239
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
they were trying to look woke i don't

240
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
know what they're trying to do but

241
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,320
they messed up the community responded

242
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,920
they paid attention to what was being

243
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,800
said

244
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
to what was offensive um and to the

245
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
response from the organization

246
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
so again really important for

247
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
that partnership to be there so that the

248
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,720
right messaging is going out

249
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
starting with the job ad and every post

250
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
that you put out that would

251
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
direct potential customers and

252
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
candidates to your company and to your

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,760
opportunities

254
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
um what does the culture look like there

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
what are they saying

256
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,320
um on social what are they putting out

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,839
what are they showing you about

258
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,680
themselves what is what are the pictures

259
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,560
look like

260
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,800
who's there what are they doing it does

261
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
it interest you do you want to do those

262
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,120
things

263
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,399
is that something that you're interested

264
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,200
in being a part of is it a fit for you

265
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
and when you look at who works there i'm

266
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
not saying stalk every single person

267
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,680
that works there but look at

268
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
look at two or three people with job

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,279
title either in the job posting that you

270
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,000
saw or

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,279
or the type of position you're

272
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
interested in doing yourself

273
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
you're going to look at their

274
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
professional profile they should have

275
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,399
one

276
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
hopefully they do um and you're going to

277
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,640
also

278
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,600
look at their social footprint and again

279
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,640
i'm not saying you're going to become a

280
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
full-on stalker don't go to their

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,720
facebook page

282
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
leave them alone but do this see if

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,279
they're talking on twitter

284
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,279
twitter is an opportunity for people to

285
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
talk about their day

286
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
talk about how do they talk to and about

287
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,720
their co-workers

288
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,760
their boss what do they say about what

289
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,279
they're learning what they're doing

290
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,640
what opportunities have been given to

291
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,560
them flexibility that's been given to

292
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:48,959
them

293
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
an opportunity did they get assert cool

294
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,240
was it a sensor

295
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,040
wow that's expensive who paid for it um

296
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,279
is this a company that i can grow at and

297
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,880
i can get those opportunities

298
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,560
at again what does the culture look like

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,920
who's doing the work there that you're

300
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
interested in doing

301
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,440
how are they talking about their days

302
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
let's face it we talk about

303
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
the food we eat we talk about the sports

304
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
teams that we like and we talk about

305
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,399
our jobs it's what we do

306
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,600
some of us talk about our kids i talk

307
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
about my dog whatever

308
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
people are giving away whether they mean

309
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,040
to or not

310
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,079
good and bad uh testimony about

311
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,000
how they spend listen we all spend a

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
good chunk of our days

313
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,959
working um so that's the kind of thing

314
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,320
that that you're gonna see

315
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
if you just spend a couple minutes

316
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,519
looking at social

317
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,560
so what are these people saying and

318
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
how have they progressed in their

319
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
careers this is important so you can use

320
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
me for an example this person was all

321
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,399
over the place they

322
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,839
they did this and then this and then

323
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,000
this did they make those moves within

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,160
the same organization did they have to

325
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,519
leave in order to grow

326
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,440
or in order to change that's important

327
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
it's also important that frankly for me

328
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
i'm a good example of someone who

329
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,360
wasn't qualified for again not just this

330
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,079
job but

331
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
it wasn't like i had programming

332
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
experience or

333
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,959
helpdesk management experience or

334
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,320
recruiting experience when i

335
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
transitioned and pivoted into those

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,720
different

337
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
business areas um so we're going to talk

338
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,279
about well how the heck did you do it

339
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
then i didn't go get the training i

340
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,760
didn't

341
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,720
get experience i i found other avenues

342
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,399
so we'll talk about that

343
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,399
um so are they advancing

344
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,079
on their professional profile when you

345
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,839
look at it when they're moving around

346
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,279
and what is the pattern that you're

347
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,240
picking up

348
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,639
okay abc company it looks like everyone

349
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,160
with this job title

350
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,920
stays in that slot for a period of time

351
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
and then leaves that seems to be the

352
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,279
pattern or

353
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,639
i see them starting here and moving up

354
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,519
cool that's a cool story um it's a cool

355
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,880
pattern for you to discover you're going

356
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,399
to rate these things

357
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
right i'm not you're going to go in

358
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
there

359
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,360
you're going to do a little bit of

360
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,480
research and then you're going to come

361
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
up with your top

362
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,279
companies based on what you're

363
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,120
discovering by looking at the people

364
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,760
that work there

365
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,920
i do have a couple disclaimers real

366
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,959
quick

367
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,480
not because i'm a mind reader but

368
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
because i think i know what questions

369
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,880
you're going to ask because i've been

370
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,079
asked them before

371
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,120
so i hear i hear you saying

372
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,519
but don't they sometimes write a job

373
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,639
description

374
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,600
specifically targeting one person or one

375
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,720
small group of people yes and

376
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,240
uh i've done it not my current employer

377
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,959
but

378
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,880
i have done it um i'll give you an

379
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
example and this goes

380
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,800
way back um i'm not going to save the

381
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
tool because then you'll know who the

382
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,880
people are

383
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,680
then i was at a company that

384
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,320
specifically wanted

385
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,600
at least one of the people who

386
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,040
developed a specific tool now in this

387
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
instance at that time there was

388
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
five people let's say you can count on

389
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,199
one hand

390
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,320
the people on the team that built that

391
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
tool

392
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,760
i did later see someone else

393
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
looking for people with experience with

394
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
that tool and they said

395
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,519
minimum 10 years experience with blah

396
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,199
it hadn't existed that long what so

397
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,760
all all being said i did end up i did

398
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,160
end up hiring a couple of those people

399
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,959
um by the way at them at defcon that's

400
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,000
how that happened

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,760
uh so yeah networking yay events um

402
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
it works but the job description was

403
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,279
written

404
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,079
for them let's just say the lead

405
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
developer's name was jane

406
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
and

407
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,000
they specifically wanted her

408
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,639
so what if you can't find her what if

409
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,079
she's not available there's a good

410
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,440
chance that's not going to

411
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,079
happen um this is where the candidate

412
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,399
and the employer need to take it a step

413
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,320
further and you you

414
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,120
are your own best advocate you you're

415
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,760
the expert

416
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,199
on you you know what you like you know

417
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,600
what you do

418
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,519
if you can find a good recruiter and i

419
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,279
hope you can because good companies have

420
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,800
good recruiters

421
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,040
that recruiter is going to make the

422
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
whole experience about

423
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,959
you finding out about you finding out

424
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,399
what you like what you want what you do

425
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,279
what you have done what you'd like to do

426
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,959
and becoming an advocate for you

427
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,360
becoming an agent for you speaking for

428
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,560
you to get you from

429
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
that applicant stage to the interview

430
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,639
table they need to get you there by

431
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,279
speaking

432
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,959
well for you so you got to speak well

433
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,720
for yourself

434
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,279
and get a recruiter a person an agent

435
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,000
who

436
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,880
is going to do a good job delivering you

437
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,240
to the people that make the hiring

438
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,079
decision

439
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,160
so enough about those job descriptions

440
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,680
that are written specifically for people

441
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,639
however

442
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,800
if you're not jane then does that mean

443
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,079
you can't get the job

444
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,920
it means that you have to look at that

445
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
description you have to figure out

446
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,040
how much of your willingness and ability

447
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,600
to

448
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,720
figure that stuff out you can deliver

449
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,639
and a good company is going to recognize

450
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,279
that and appreciate that

451
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,800
i will only spend a moment on this next

452
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
thing what you should run away from

453
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
um these are real job descriptions thank

454
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
you by the way to everyone who responded

455
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,040
to my tweet

456
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,079
and sent in horrible job descriptions

457
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,320
i get it i'm sorry i am sorry that it

458
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,199
happens

459
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,759
um but thank you for those examples i'm

460
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,720
not sharing

461
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
all of them i i picked

462
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,959
one description i won't say who

463
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,120
it's from but we'll get to in a little

464
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,399
bit and

465
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,600
i was hoping to automate all the uh

466
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,560
animate all the questions that pop into

467
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
my head if i'm the candidate

468
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,520
when i see those descriptions but um

469
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,839
i ended up just writing it all out i

470
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,919
will show you these are not funny

471
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,039
i'm not going to read them to you

472
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,959
because they're offensive but these are

473
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,480
real

474
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
and um hopefully i redacted everything

475
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,439
that would tell you who these people

476
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,640
are but if you see something

477
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,599
i don't know if they're trying to be

478
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
cute or funny i don't know what the heck

479
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,799
they're trying to do

480
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,200
here but if if you don't waste your time

481
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,840
if if they screwed up this bad um just

482
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
just run away run away from the

483
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,039
from these sturdy okay

484
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,080
so back to your requirements so you

485
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
the the job

486
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,559
post is indicative likely of

487
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,200
at the very least that this is a company

488
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
that's hiring or they were hiring

489
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,679
so you're going to build your own

490
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,440
requirements list remember we talked

491
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
about how the job description

492
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,840
should be broken down between what is a

493
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,760
requirement and what is a preferred

494
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,480
skill

495
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,799
i need you to do that i need you to have

496
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,720
at least two or three columns

497
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,799
where you're going to start by figuring

498
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,760
out what

499
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
you need versus want versus would be

500
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
kind of groovy to have

501
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
and you can rate as you're looking

502
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,840
through those people that are posting

503
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
and you're doing your research on those

504
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,919
on those companies you can rate them

505
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,720
according to

506
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,200
what looks like it's going to match up

507
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,080
to as

508
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
many of the things that are important to

509
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,280
you as possible

510
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,760
that could be flexibility it could be

511
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,039
schedule it could be

512
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,160
ability to work remotely room and

513
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,360
opportunities

514
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
to grow remember we talked about how you

515
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,039
could identify those things based on

516
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,160
what it looks

517
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
like is a pattern for the people that

518
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,039
previously or currently work there

519
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
how does it appear as though they're

520
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,679
providing opportunities

521
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,679
is their marketing department showing

522
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,960
you a lot of cool things that are

523
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
happening that you'd like to be involved

524
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,360
with

525
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,880
are they sponsoring cool events are they

526
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,960
providing training are they advertising

527
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
that a lot of people are getting

528
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
certifications there this is cool stuff

529
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
think about things that are deal

530
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,880
breakers for you too if they're just

531
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
getting involved

532
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,240
in things that are not a fit for you

533
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
you know have have high standards

534
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,440
pretend that you know this is

535
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,480
that this is i have likened to what i

536
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
imagined dating would be like

537
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
um you got to keep trying you got to

538
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
keep your standards high

539
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
and you have to um figure out what

540
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,400
really matters most to you so that this

541
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,200
could end up being

542
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
a long happy relationship when you get

543
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
your next thing

544
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,919
um rank and proceed so this job

545
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,400
description

546
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
kind of put my glasses to see it so

547
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,720
let's go through

548
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,160
um just real quick i just

549
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,320
did the quals and desired

550
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,799
and we could uh we could figure out how

551
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,080
many of these things we should scoot

552
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
down right like so

553
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
a lot of what they're putting in the

554
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,559
basic walls

555
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,919
they fail to provide

556
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,600
in each of each bullet that's a lot

557
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,679
they really need to move some of those

558
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,000
basic quals down into desired or they

559
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
need to

560
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
further define how they are quantifying

561
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
and measuring these things

562
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,159
but let's start with the first one

563
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,840
hmm polly do you

564
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
mean counterintelligence do you mean ci

565
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,799
do you mean fosco what

566
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,000
what kind of poly are we talking about

567
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
here i get that you can't tell me

568
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
who the customer is but do

569
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,039
which one do you mean it matters

570
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,159
and do you mean active or do you mean

571
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,840
eligible

572
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,960
do you mean somebody who

573
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,360
who passed the poly three years ago and

574
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
they're still in that window

575
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,919
or these are reasonable questions for

576
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,400
you

577
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,679
so what when i walk through the bullets

578
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,600
and i could have i could have put a

579
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
question next to every

580
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
almost every single one of them but

581
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,320
when you see a bullet that that raises a

582
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,480
flag or causes a question for you that

583
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,039
doesn't mean

584
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,159
stop it means write it down and again i

585
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,280
told you

586
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,159
that a good employer or potential

587
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,919
employer is going to have a recruiting

588
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,520
team that is going to either find out

589
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
the answers for you they're 100

590
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,120
gonna spend the time listening to your

591
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,480
concerns

592
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,760
and then they will either know the

593
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,480
answers or find out the answers for you

594
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
in this case like i said you're

595
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,760
wondering

596
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,919
okay what do you mean by polly

597
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,120
ask the question uh

598
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
does comparable experience count for

599
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,159
bachelors

600
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,919
in my current case if it hadn't i

601
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,400
wouldn't be here um and every other job

602
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,280
i've had

603
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,640
um so that's an important question too

604
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,159
if if i hadn't met the ceo of my current

605
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,280
company

606
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,159
at blackhead because of a networking

607
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,760
connection

608
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,559
um and i had seen the job posting i

609
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,320
probably would not have applied for it

610
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,440
because

611
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,440
on paper i don't qualify so

612
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,559
moving on um i don't know i

613
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,720
again have an example for everything but

614
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,320
okay when you say

615
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,640
all these forensics tools

616
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,000
do you also mean does wire shark

617
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,640
count i mean it's open source right does

618
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
it count i don't know

619
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,760
um i hate the way they've grouped

620
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,280
all these programming and scripting

621
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,960
languages together

622
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
um c and c plus plus well they're not

623
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
the same okay so you talk about python

624
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,520
and pearl and java

625
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,720
that's a bunch of scripting um

626
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,640
i have scripted i've

627
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,000
never written an executable file from

628
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,720
scratch

629
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,320
so there's that's very different from

630
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
scripting does it count because you put

631
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,679
it all together

632
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,679
what do you mean here are you looking

633
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,200
for several different people at all

634
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,640
these different levels of experience or

635
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,000
different types of experience

636
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,960
or do i have to have the operating level

637
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,159
experience

638
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,400
and scripting like come on you shouldn't

639
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,200
have

640
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,320
shouldn't have grouped it all together

641
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
like that so write it down ask the

642
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,159
question be able to speak to what you

643
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,600
have done and

644
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,080
and um and what you are willing to do

645
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,960
and what you

646
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,640
are capable of learning having had

647
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
learned it before

648
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
um i hate that it says deep

649
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
understanding what what the heck does

650
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,679
that mean

651
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,799
are you measuring that with a ruler

652
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,159
scale what um

653
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,279
ask the question and then when they kind

654
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:45,520
of

655
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,880
like again strong what does strong mean

656
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,919
shame on whoever wrote this this is bad

657
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,480
this is not compliant and it's confusing

658
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,279
um

659
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,200
so there's a lot to unpack in the last

660
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,400
bullet uh

661
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,440
under qualls where it says

662
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,200
good interpersonal strong initiative

663
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
problem solving organizational

664
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,320
organizational what writing

665
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
communication and briefing skills

666
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,679
that's a lot so i wouldn't address

667
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,640
every single one of those things this is

668
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,279
where

669
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,159
i give this gives you the opportunity to

670
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,760
tell a story i guess

671
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,279
um well with regard to

672
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,559
interpersonal skills i'm i'm leading a

673
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,159
team call

674
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,279
um every two weeks

675
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,400
and as far as initiative goes i

676
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,279
started a research project which ended

677
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
up turning into

678
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,679
a solution for the customer hence

679
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,120
problem solving

680
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,640
um you can talk about things that you've

681
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,200

you can talk about um any communications

683
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,400
that you that you do regularly

684

i write a newsletter once a month um

685
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
there's just a lot to unpack here but

686
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,159
this is opera an opportunity for you

687
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,400
when you get to the interview table

688
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,320
after talking to the recruiter

689
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,840
to have stories ready that refer to

690
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,320
these

691
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,840
these different types of skills

692
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,159
there are different levels of certs and

693
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,960
some certs

694
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,559
are harder than others and some are more

695
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,080
expensive than others this is an

696
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,559
opportunity for you to figure out if the

697
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
comparable certifications

698
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,200
count um or some of these are deal

699
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,760
breakers

700
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,159
and i will say sometimes the end

701
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,200
customer

702
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,400
is the one who they they wrote the

703
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,640
sound it says must have this um

704
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,960
okay are you giving the opportunity or

705
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,559
providing the training or the budget to

706
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,240
get those things do i need it right off

707
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,279
the bat

708
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,520
um so again this is opportunity for you

709
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,039
to ask questions

710
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,000
so i already mentioned all these

711
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,600
different types of

712
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
blockers um that you will identify

713
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,120
within

714
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,480

715
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480

certifications

717
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,679
training and so forth recruiters are

718
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,520
going to be a big key for you

719
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,600
um if you're super interested in a

720
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,039
company and

721
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,559
recruiting is i don't know dropping the

722
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,159
ball or making mistakes or

723
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,200
or not getting your questions answered

724
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,400
um you can't take it a step further you

725
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,200
can

726
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
um first of all if they're not

727
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,799
answering your application that's just a

728
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,000
volume problem

729
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,720
um i was super guilty of that back when

730
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,080
i was recruiting

731
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,200
um this is where you're going to go to

732
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,400
linkedin

733
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,840
um every recruiter worth salt is

734
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,679
on there they're there and they're and

735
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,960
they're listening to and they're

736
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,400
answering their messages

737
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,520
there you can go directly to anyone that

738
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,240
looks like they're

739
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,039
in a management position at the company

740
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,600
as well

741
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,720

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,679
take the time to you know to to do the

749
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,120
messaging on

750

752
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,720
um so again listen events can't say

753
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
enough about it hey guess what congrats

754

755
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,679
you're watching this

756
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
um then you already did the first step

757
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,840
you're at an event

758
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,960
um i

759
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
wish that i must have written this

760
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,600
months ago okay covet is is

761
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
looking it's looking hopeful that that's

762
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,840
coming to a close here or that we're at

763
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,559
least

764
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,399
in a much better place than we were when

765
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,440
i did this a year ago

766
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,039
events i can't say enough good stuff

767
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,960
about them i do

768
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,600
hope and i am hopeful that um

769
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,200
events will be doing what uh

770
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,320
defcon and b-sides like black hat are

771
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,440
doing this year they

772
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,960
are um offering the hybrid opportunity

773
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
i hope they continue that forever

774
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,480
frankly

775
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,880
at different times in our lives we have

776
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,240
different

777
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,399
budget and availability for traveling we

778
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,880
can't all jump on planes all the time

779
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,039
so offering the hybrid option

780
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,320
is fantastic i will say that car hiking

781
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,200
village

782
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,520
we were doing it before it was a thing

783
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,320
um

784
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,120
we we were already committed to doing it

785
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,480
this year so

786
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,039
if you come to defcon you can see us

787
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,200
either way virtually or in person

788
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,360
but again i'm really excited about this

789
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,039
being the the way of the future and the

790
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,640
way that we continue to

791
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
to offer different events for everyone

792
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
so that they can do it

793
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,520
cannot say enough good stuff about mock

794
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
interviews and resume workshops

795
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,279

796
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,840

847
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:48,640
were

848
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,679
we were talking about all those

849
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,360
different languages where you might say

850
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,279

851

856
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,559
case may be

857
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,720
you're when you notice the things in the

858
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
job description that you

859
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,600
either want to address that you have

860
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,360
or that you have something similar to

861
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,200
this is your opportunity to customize

862
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,799
your resume to push those things up to

863
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,919

um and the resume workshops is going to

865
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,159

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:28,720
say

867
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,440
and maybe go in there with not just your

868
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,000
resume

869
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
