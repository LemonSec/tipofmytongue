welcome everybody to

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,000
our session but what about those medium

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,799
and low vulnerabilities welcome to

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,640

and ceh i also just had the pleasure of

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,480
talking to her about the dc area

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
and all the good food out there so let's

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,039
go ahead and turn it on over

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,800
great thank you so much yeah we were

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,719
just uh chatting about uh crabs over

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,320
here in maryland so we were uh

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,119
all right we were talking about those

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,799
let me share my presentation real quick

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,880
all right so um thank you first of all

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,240
thank you everybody for

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,600
uh for coming to the session um

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
uh as mentioned i'm gonna be

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
specifically speaking about low and

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
medium vulnerabilities

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
a little bit about vulnerability

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
chaining some complexity issues some

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,680
things like that

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,720
so thank you for joining me and of

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,759
course thank you for

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,640
besides satx for having me uh happy to

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,240
be here for sure

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,600
so i actually just recently switched

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
jobs i am actually a security architect

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,200
with ibm now

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
um still an adjunct professor teaching

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
everything from quantitative methods to

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,159
incident response and

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
everything in between i do hold a

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,159
doctorate of science in cyber security

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,479
which is what uh we'll get into a little

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,600
bit but what got me

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,680
really really excited about this topic

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
um and and why i've spent so much time

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,399
researching it

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,159
i'm also working on a phd in human

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
factors uh

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
and i've done some other research where

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,960
i'm kind of blending cyber security and

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
human factors and

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
and trying to solve some problems there

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,480
and then as well as some industry

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
certifications as well

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
uh quick disclaimer all thoughts

65
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,680
feelings views expressed in this

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,319
presentation

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,640
are my own uh they do not reflect my

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,400
employer employers um

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
i do these talks and i do this research

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,560
just because i love it and i love to

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,480
share kind of what i've found or

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,560
problems i'm seeing in the industry and

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,080
uh

74
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
so that's that and then um so quick run

75
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,080
down of the agenda

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
what kind of what i want to cover here

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,400
uh we're going to kind of cover cvss

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
scoring so the common vulnerability

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
scoring system

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
uh talk about vulnerability scoring uh

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,160
then we're going to talk about some

82
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,360
medium vulnerabilities some low

83
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
vulnerabilities

84
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
as well as vulnerability chaining and

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,319
then hopefully some actionable items

86
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:52,720
that

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,959
you know if you aren't aware of this or

88
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,319
you know maybe you're learning about it

89
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
uh some things that you could kind of

90
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
take back to your own organization

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
take back to your own team and maybe do

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
some investigation

93
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,800
so um i know this is a lot on one slide

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,040
i tried to break this down but i felt

95
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
like it was really important

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,840
when we're talking about how

97
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
vulnerabilities are scored

98
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,080
to really dig deep into how cvss scores

99
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,200
vulnerabilities

100
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,799
um and i wanted to mention that

101
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,879
you know when i was doing this research

102
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,319
um with my

103
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,360
doctorate of science uh so i got really

104
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,000
interested

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
in how low and medium vulnerabilities

106
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,319
um maybe how they interact what is

107
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,920
vulnerability chaining how are they

108
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,040
scored

109
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,360
uh how how did we come to the conclusion

110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
that these vulnerabilities are scored as

111
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,080
low and medium that

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
that really made me interested uh mostly

113
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
because at the time

114
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,319
uh where i was working we didn't really

115
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
have a lot of time to work on low and

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,360
medium vulnerabilities

117
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,959
and as i talk with other people and i

118
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
work on other teams i'm starting to find

119
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
that that's kind of a similar pattern

120
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
you know whether it's in the public

121
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,720
sector

122
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,360
um or private sector i i think sometimes

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,959
it can be really challenging depending

124
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,480
on the size of your team especially

125
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
small to medium-sized businesses

126
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
might have a more difficult time getting

127
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,040
to these low and medium vulnerabilities

128
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,440
so i wanted to start by kind of breaking

129
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
down the cvss

130
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,079
cvss scoring um so

131
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,960
this is how for the most part we score

132
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
vulnerabilities and how we see them

133
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
in our products so like if you're using

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,160
tenable or qualis

135
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,479
any vulnerability scanning and reporting

136
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
software you're probably going to be

137
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,520
based off of the cvss scores and

138
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,160
typically

139
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
you'll see a cvss 2.0 and a 3.0 score

140
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,000
i'll get into that a little

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
bit more as well but basically right now

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
the standard is 3.0

143
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,960
or excuse me 3.1 they're on now but 3.0

144
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,440
is

145
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,400
where a lot of the scoring comes from so

146
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
the cvss scoring is broken down into

147
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,240
three groups you can see here the basic

148
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
metric group

149
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,560
the temporal metric group and the

150
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
environmental group

151
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,720
these three groups are then broken down

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,600
into several

153
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,240
other subcategories each one of these

154
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,120
categories

155
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,320
is looked at and evaluated and they're

156
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
all brought together to bring up that

157
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
vulnerability score that you would see

158
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
whether it's a 5.4

159
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,160
or 9.8 which would be a critical um so

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,199
all of these things make up

161
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,919
the cvss score i felt like it was really

162
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,440
important to bring that up because

163
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,680
when i started um you know asking

164
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,800
questions about low and medium

165
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,840
vulnerabilities i was like

166
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
don't worry about those i was like well

167
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,199
now i need to really understand why

168
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,639
they're scored low

169
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,520
and then should i be concerned about

170
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,080
them

171
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
because i started looking at uh let's

172
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
take for example

173
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,479
an ssl certificate vulnerability a lot

174
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:44,960
of them

175
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
are scored as low uh but you could have

176
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,000
maybe

177
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,479
you know 10 20 30 ssl vulnerabilities

178
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,160
scored as low

179
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
and if you don't start to fix them they

180
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400
could start to pile up um so i i started

181
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
really looking into those

182
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
and even i don't know if anybody

183
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,720
remembers in

184
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
january 2017 spectre meltdown when that

185
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,280
vulnerability came out there were

186
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,000
actually a

187
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
lot of vulnerabilities attached to that

188
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
kind of family of vulnerabilities and a

189
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,759
lot of them were scored as low and

190
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,720
medium

191
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
and that also sort of peaked my interest

192
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
because

193
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,199
even if they are scored lower these

194
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,280
vulnerabilities still can be exploited

195
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
and some of them are actively being

196
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
exploited in the wild

197
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
um their their scores may change as

198
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
they're exploited in the wild

199
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,919
but you know if you aren't taking a look

200
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
at them or or maybe you don't have time

201
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,400
to look at them

202
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
it's possible that they could still be

203
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
exploited

204
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,319
um so now that we've kind of covered

205
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
vulnerability scoring a little bit

206
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
i wanted to talk about some specific

207
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,000
examples of medium and low

208
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
vulnerabilities

209
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,240
and sort of highlight why they're so

210
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,199
important um or at least just to look at

211
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,919
um

212
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,440
so the first one that i picked i wanted

213
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
to pick some newer vulnerabilities that

214
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,840
were released

215
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,199
and of course if you have any questions

216
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
i included references here

217
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,560
to both the nvd the national

218
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
vulnerability database where the

219
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
vulnerabilities are housed

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,479
as well as the actual advisories that

221
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,599
give more information on the

222
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,280
vulnerabilities

223
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,759
so the first one here this was released

224
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,520
i believe in february or march

225
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,560
might have been april of this year this

226
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,120
is cve

227
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,400
2021-2164 this is

228
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,520
ultimately was scored as a medium

229
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,319
this vulnerability specifically in

230
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,800
jenkins dashboard and

231
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,080
this is the it's the improper

232
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,919
neutralization of input

233
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,080
during web page generalization which

234
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,639
leads to a cross-site scripting

235
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
vulnerability so ultimately was scored

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,039
as a medium

237
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,240
and there's a couple of reasons why the

238
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
first is that

239
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
vendors when they're submitting these

240
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
vulnerabilities or you know these known

241
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,879
vulnerabilities

242
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,520
they can include as much information as

243
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,039
they want or as little information as

244
00:07:59,039 --> 00:07:59,840
they want

245
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,039
so depending on how much information

246
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,000
they want to give to

247
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,599
to industry and to those working on the

248
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,000
vulnerabilities that may change the

249
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
score of the vulnerability as well as

250
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
how much information is available

251
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
for this particular vulnerability and

252
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
i'm not calling out any type of software

253
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,599
i'm just saying

254
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,680
for the specific vulnerability there is

255
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
one small paragraph that's included on

256
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
the website so

257
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,280
it is difficult to get uh how much

258
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,479
information is

259
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
is really available about this one um

260
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,000
just kind of what we know

261
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,960
is kind of a short blurb on the website

262
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,799
but basically this is exploitable

263
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,000
with view and configure permissions

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
so what i thought was interesting about

265
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,360
this

266
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,839
you would as an attacker you would have

267
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,799
to have

268
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,600
view and configure permissions to to

269
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
exploit this vulnerability

270
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,279
however if this was on a public-facing

271
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,160
web server and let's say any user that

272
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
logs in or creates an account

273
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
has view permissions they would be able

274
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
to exploit this vulnerability

275
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,200
now there may be other controls in place

276
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
that might mitigate this which would be

277
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
great

278
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,640
um maybe there aren't maybe because it

279
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,480
was scored as a medium which is sort of

280
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,600
what i'm getting at

281
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,320
maybe because it was scored as a medium

282
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
maybe it doesn't have to be

283
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,200
remediated for you know 90 days um

284
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
sometimes different vulnerability

285
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
management programs you know they might

286
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,839
have

287
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,279
you know you've got 30 days to fix

288
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,120
critical 60 to fix

289
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,279
highs and you've got 90 days to fix lows

290
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,240
and mediums

291
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
or something like that um hopefully

292
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,760
they're not waiting 30 days to fix

293
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
criticals but it's possible

294
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
so it's possible in the 90 days

295
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,240
that this vulnerability has been sitting

296
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
out there if there were other priorities

297
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
other projects

298
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
other resources other other things that

299
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
were more important than this

300
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,839
that maybe it's still unremediated you

301
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,120
know we're in june now

302
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
if it came out in april maybe it's still

303
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,640
sitting there unremediated and

304
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,360
it could be exploited depending on you

305
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
know the setup of

306
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,720
of a company or anything but uh someone

307
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,360
could

308
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,519
you know run a scan a malicious attacker

309
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,880
could run a scan to see if this

310
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
vulnerability exists and possibly

311
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,600
exploit it

312
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
and if they're able to get in with this

313
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,640
cross-site scripting vulnerability

314
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
they may be able to leverage other

315
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
vulnerabilities once they get in

316
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,519
to potentially elevate privileges or you

317
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,640
know hopefully not full system

318
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
compromise but who knows

319
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,000
and we'll get a little bit more into

320
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
that once i talk about vulnerability

321
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
chaining

322
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
so for my second vulnerability i wanted

323
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,000
to talk

324
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,519
about talk about a low vulnerability

325
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,839
so this is cve 2021-2308

326
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,760
uh scored as a 2.7 which is pretty low

327
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,440
um again the re references are down in

328
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,000
the bottom

329
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
if you wanted to take a look uh the

330
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,200
interesting thing about this

331
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,519
vulnerability this is in my sequel

332
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,440
server also in oracle mysql and

333
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,560
can be seen in netapp software

334
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,680
because it may have a mysql backing so

335
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,880
the interesting thing about this

336
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
vulnerability is that

337
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,240
it's not just one vulnerability it could

338
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,079
possibly be one vulnerability in

339
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,680
multiple products

340
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,200
again if a the patch is applied

341
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,680
on you know either netapp or in oracle

342
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
mysql it's very possible that it would

343
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
resolve this vulnerability as well um

344
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,680
but

345
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,279
if this vulnerability is sitting out

346
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,160
there uh on a mysql server

347
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,600
the implication is that you know a

348
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,360
it it's easily exploitable but mostly

349
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
because an attacker would have to have

350
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,680
highly privileged access anyway

351
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
so that sort of negates it right it's

352
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,959
like well they'd have to have highly

353
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,640
privileged access they may have already

354
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
escalated privileges they may already

355
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
have access to other things so why would

356
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
i worry about this

357
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,959
and that's partially true maybe there

358
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,120
are other things that are more important

359
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,480
but the concern is if this vulnerability

360
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
is hanging out

361
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
let's say you had a malicious insider

362
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,200
someone who already had access to the

363
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,920
system

364
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,399
and this vulnerability is hanging out

365
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,000
it's possible that they could exploit

366
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,519
this and use this

367
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,399
to their advantage or let's say they

368
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,440
were

369
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
maybe they were let go maybe a

370
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,639
disgruntled employee

371
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,160
and they knew that these vulnerabilities

372
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
existed because the mediums and lows are

373
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,800
not

374
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,480
uh resolved they could use their insider

375
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
knowledge to potentially get in

376
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,880
steal information especially in a sql

377
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,279
server or sql database uh who knows what

378
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,360
what information you might have in there

379
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
uh so

380
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
it's one of those things that's more

381
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,240
about trying to bring awareness to this

382
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,279
that

383
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,480
in the grand scheme of things when

384
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,360
you're looking at a thousand

385
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
vulnerabilities

386
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,720
it's it's more pertinent to focus on the

387
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
criticals and highs

388
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,279
but it doesn't mean that we don't look

389
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,279
at the mediums and lows it's that

390
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,399
you know we need to bring context

391
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,480
to what we're looking at and to really

392
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,920
understand what these vulnerabilities

393
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,720
mean

394
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
and again there's there's good

395
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
information out there on this

396
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
vulnerability

397
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,079
uh again it's a like a paragraph or two

398
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,040
paragraphs

399
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,600
uh so you don't necessarily have that

400
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,160
depth

401
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,480
of understanding and knowledge um just

402
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,360
out there

403
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,560
to understand kind of what this

404
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
vulnerability might mean to your

405
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
environment

406
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,680
um and it's really important to

407
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,200
kind of when you see vulnerabilities

408
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
like this that might be affected in

409
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
multiple products

410
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,279
uh what are the implications

411
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,120
so what does that mean for me if i

412
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,040
if i'm not looking at mediums and lows

413
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,120
if i don't have time to or if you know

414
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,519
we

415
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
we have a longer uh timeline that we

416
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,560
remediate vulnerabilities

417
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
what does it mean for my environment

418
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,639
where are my critical assets what am i

419
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,920
concerned with

420
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
uh you know the first question here what

421
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,440
privileges do my users have

422
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,040
and that blends back into that last

423
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,360
vulnerability we looked at where

424
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,399
if i'm concerned about how many people

425
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
have administrative access

426
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
do they have local access do they have

427
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,600
application access

428
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
do they have sql access um you know so

429
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,399
understanding you know your identity and

430
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,519
access management

431
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,240
policies and who actually has access to

432
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,279
these systems

433
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,399
i think is really important when you're

434
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,839
looking at vulnerabilities because if

435
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,279
you don't have time to remediate them

436
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:09,760
but you

437
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
understand the structure you have in

438
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
place maybe

439
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,639
maybe you use micro uh segmentation for

440
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,519
your network

441
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,360
um maybe you have a zero or you're

442
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,959
implementing a zero trust architecture

443
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,000
things like that

444
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,240
um so you maybe you have other

445
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
compensating controls in place

446
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,160
uh that would make these vulnerabilities

447
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,639
at least null and void which is great

448
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,720
but it's something to consider right

449
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
um and then what access does the

450
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,240
attacker gain through the vulnerability

451
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
so if the attacker let's say in the

452
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,399
first

453
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,040
medium vulnerability we talked about in

454
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,399
that first scenario

455
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,639
let's say they got access to my jenkins

456
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,519
server

457
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,360
um maybe that's bad maybe it's not

458
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
depends on my environment and maybe it

459
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,800
depends on what jenkins server they got

460
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,920
access to

461
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,519
you know maybe i have a test dev

462
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,880
environment that's available for my

463
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
admins uh that's

464
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
you know i'm not as concerned about but

465
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,680
maybe they

466
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,199
are able to leverage that to get into

467
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,040
production systems if they are connected

468
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,000
somehow

469
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,720
um so that's where that consideration

470
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,440
comes in of

471
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,040
what what is that where what servers are

472
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,639
actually connected to what servers what

473
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
databases are connected

474
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
how would someone be able to to traverse

475
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,000
through my network

476
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,360
um and then of course do i have

477
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
mitigating controls in place or

478
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,360
could i implement mitigating controls so

479
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,959
that you know let's say i've got a

480
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,040
thousand low vulnerabilities

481
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,399
i don't have time to look at all of

482
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
those if i

483
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,320
see you know as i mentioned in the

484
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,839
beginning if i see a number of them are

485
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,000
ssl vulnerabilities and i can fix a lot

486
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
of them with one certificate or maybe

487
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
one change to an ssl certificate

488
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
uh that might be you know getting the

489
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
biggest bang for my buck maybe i can fix

490
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,600
this with one thing so it's sort of

491
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,079
about

492
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,240
you know kind of taking this as a whole

493
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,920
um and sort of understanding what the

494
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,720
implications

495
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
are by leaving those low and medium

496
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,839
vulnerabilities

497
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,600
open in your network what it might mean

498
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,279
to you or to your environment

499
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,320
so here we're going to talk about

500
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
vulnerability chaining so this is sort

501
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,800
of where

502
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
what i'm getting at by leaving low and

503
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,839
medium vulnerabilities

504
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,320
unexplored or maybe not looking at them

505
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
as heavily

506
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,440
so vulnerability chaining cvss

507
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
has a they have a really great

508
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,480
uh paragraph they have a really great

509
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
section about vulnerability chaining in

510
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
their user guide

511
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
uh the nist 853 r5 now

512
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,600
uh has a nice little section on

513
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,519
vulnerability chaining as well but i've

514
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,320
seen it

515
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,399
be called a number of different things

516
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,600
daisy chaining vulnerability linking

517
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,160
so the idea behind vulnerability

518
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,600
chaining is that you're using multiple

519
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,240
vulnerabilities during a single attack

520
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,920
but really using low and medium

521
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
vulnerabilities or lower scored

522
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,880
vulnerabilities uh to create a critical

523
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
attack

524
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,800
this is a common tactic uh apt groups i

525
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,959
think she moon and a bunch of other ones

526
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,519
uh they've been known to use these

527
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,480
techniques

528
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,519
um and we know that hackers will try uh

529
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,039
you know they're gonna try any method

530
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
they can to get in and if they have to

531
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,280
leverage multiple vulnerabilities then

532
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
that's what they'll do to to you know

533
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,119
get into the systems um

534
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,319
so part of the problem that i see

535
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,559
and why i got so interested in studying

536
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,839
this in the first place

537
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
is that vulnerability chaining is an

538
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,000
optional metric for cvss

539
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,359
analysts when they submit these

540
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,280
vulnerabilities they have the option

541
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,600
to add how this vulnerability you know

542
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,120
how one vulnerability could be used with

543
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,240
multiple vulnerabilities

544
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
but it's not a formal metric it's not a

545
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,559
requirement

546
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,720
and i started to see that as a potential

547
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
issue because

548
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
if we don't know how vulnerabilities

549
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
could be linked or could be leveraged

550
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
especially if you don't you know go

551
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
really really in depth

552
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,720
uh in vulnerabilities in your

553
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
vulnerability management program

554
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,240
it could be a gap that is left open

555
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
um you know that that maybe could be

556
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,840
concerning especially for certain

557
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,799
systems

558
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,000
that you may want to protect your

559
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,520
critical assets you know anything that

560
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,080
has your business proprietary data or

561
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,160
uh you know pii things like that that

562
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,360
you might want to

563
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
uh just maybe take a double double look

564
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,880
at

565
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
and of course this might include

566
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,000
vulnerabilities or other products

567
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
so just like we saw in that

568
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,559
vulnerability that was scored as a low

569
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,960
it is possible that that vulnerability

570
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,559
is affected in multiple types of

571
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
software so it went from my sequel to

572
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,520
being oracle see

573
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,559
oracle mysu mysql as well as netapp

574
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,720
because that product that application

575
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,280
could be used in multiple ways

576
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,080
so to me it's more about just kind of

577
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,760
having that awareness like being aware

578
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,799
that this is a

579
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,080
problem and that attackers apt groups

580
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,320
are

581
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,960
leveraging this all the time you know

582
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,760
they they

583
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,280
they want to get into our systems and

584
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,720
they're going to use any way possible

585
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,200
and

586
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,240
uh this is certainly a well-documented

587
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,039
way that they get in um

588
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,120
i wanted to include some specific

589
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
examples of vulnerability chaining since

590
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
we talked about it sort of theoretically

591
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,600
uh sql injection leading to a cross-site

592
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,720
scripting

593
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,880
buffer overflow leading to local admin

594
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,000
privileges

595
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
um you know the idea here is that

596
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,039
we if a sql injection which i've seen

597
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,080
is scored as a low or a medium

598
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
and we're not remediating that for

599
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
whatever reason even if it's on our

600
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,160
system for

601
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
30 days or 40 days something like that

602
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
it's something that could be leveraged

603
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,200
um you know if we

604
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
are focusing on this critical vmware

605
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,559
vulnerability or this critical

606
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,840
net scale or vulnerability something

607
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
like that and we're missing sql

608
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,960
injection or cross-site scripting

609
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
vulnerabilities

610
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,919
we're potentially missing some of the

611
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,720
other

612
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,480
very uh possible and you know known ways

613
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,919
that attackers might be trying to get

614
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,160
into our systems

615
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,880
spear phishing email to download malware

616
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,440
um

617
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
which could lead to privilege escalation

618
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,400
i don't know where we've seen that

619
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,200
before

620
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,679
um but you know spear phishing and

621
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,120
phishing emails are used

622
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,039
i mean all the time to try to download

623
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,960
malware or you know get you to click on

624
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,320
anything um

625
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
and then of course a vpn vulnerability

626
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,120
that could give access to other network

627
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,000
devices

628
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,520
uh which could lead to a remote code

629
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,039
execution

630
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,400
and a lot of these vulnerabilities that

631
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,600
we're talking about sql injection

632
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,640
cross-site scripting

633
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,760
remote code execution injection these

634
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,080
are

635
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,440
all always on the os top 10

636
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,919
and so i think it's really important

637
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
especially if they are scored lower

638
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,760
and maybe we're missing them because

639
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,440
we're just not looking at them

640
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,360
that it could be another way that

641
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,480
attackers are

642
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
you know leveraging and working to try

643
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,159
to make their way into our systems

644
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
all right so all right i've given you a

645
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,559
ton of information right

646
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,760
we talked about some specific

647
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
vulnerability examples we talked about

648
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,679
vulnerability chaining and what it means

649
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,360
and then we talked about some very

650
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,039
specific examples of how vulnerability

651
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
chaining is used actively in the wild

652
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
so what do i do now what do i do with

653
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
this information um

654
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
i think the biggest thing and i

655
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,880
mentioned this a little bit but to add

656
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
context to vulnerabilities

657
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,880
you know don't just take them at what

658
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,640
the score says

659
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
don't just take them at you know it's

660
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
this says it's uh you know i just need

661
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,520
to apply this patch

662
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
you know sometimes it's apply a patch

663
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,880
and a registry key you know sometimes

664
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
it's apply a patch and it's a secure

665
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,159
configuration setting

666
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,039
um so adding context to kind of what

667
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,320
you're looking at you know doing that

668
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,600
additional research

669
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,200
because i know it's helped me a lot to

670
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,720
really understand what those

671
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,880
vulnerabilities mean

672
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,080
and then of course consider the

673
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
implications in your organization

674
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,960
specifically

675
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,559
there's a lot of really great general

676
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,240
information out there you know nist has

677
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
a lot of great guides there's the rmf

678
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,120
there's the cf

679
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
csf um you know we've got the miter

680
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
attack framework so we can start to

681
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,520
understand

682
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,159
pathing and traversal from attackers um

683
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,840
there's a lot of really great

684
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,760
uh general information out there but i

685
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
think you have to really

686
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,240
you know at some point think

687
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,919
subjectively and think about how does

688
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,960
this affect

689
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
my system architecture how does my

690
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,320
network look

691
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,559
um and so to kind of get a better

692
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,320
picture of that you know just to really

693
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,520
see what you have

694
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,960
and then figure out where your greatest

695
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,880
risks are because maybe it isn't low and

696
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,400
medium vulnerabilities maybe you aren't

697
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600
at the end of the day concerned about

698
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,000
them

699
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
but it's important to look at them and

700
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
see how they might affect your

701
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,880
environment

702
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
um and of course what tools do you have

703
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,720
um do you already have this capability

704
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,240
available there are some tools out there

705
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,320
like i know tenable vpr it's their

706
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
vulnerability priority

707
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,280
rating or ranking can be used to try to

708
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,760
help

709
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
give like heat maps and try to help you

710
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
understand a bit more about risk in your

711
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,480
environment

712
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,760
and there's some other tools out there

713
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,600
that are doing that as well

714
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,440
and then what's the maturity level of

715
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
your vulnerability management program

716
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,400
so where are you at

717
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,159
is it really just hey we can only fix

718
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,520
the criticals and highs right now that's

719
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,320
okay

720
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
so then it's like how do we mature our

721
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
program how can we get to that point

722
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,080
where i can start to consider low and

723
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,760
medium vulnerabilities and how they

724
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,120
might be

725
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
you know affecting my environment so

726
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,559
it's it's

727
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,320
kind of doing some road mapping thinking

728
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,640
about your your maturity model

729
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
and your how you can actually get there

730
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,840
so

731
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,600
maybe having a vulnerability management

732
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
expert come in

733
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,520
or a consultant or you know just talking

734
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,200
with someone who maybe has

735
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,640
you know some really great vulnerability

736
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,039
knowledge about how you can mature your

737
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,200
program how you can kind of get to that

738
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,159
place

739
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,360
where you can start to look at

740
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,080
vulnerabilities with more more context

741
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,159
uh and and understanding how they affect

742
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,520
your organization

743
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,240
um and learning about vulnerabilities i

744
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,880
uh

745
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,840
i i joked before i i got on this call

746
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,559
but

747
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,240
i'm like always out here banging my drum

748
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
for low medium vulnerabilities because

749
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,840
i think it's at least important to

750
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,480
understand that uh they can be exploited

751
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,080
and some of them are actively exploited

752
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,960
in the wild

753
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
um that'll that shocks some people that

754
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,240
they're like oh i didn't know i thought

755
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,919
if they were scored as low

756
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,520
that maybe people weren't even looking

757
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,159
at them which unfortunately is not the

758
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:56,880
case

759
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,039
uh so i always say go out and do

760
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,559
research there's a lot of great

761
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,880
information available from cvss

762
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,960
from you know the mitre attack framework

763
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,000
and uh

764
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,799
so you can sort of start to to gain that

765
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,400
deeper knowledge and that

766
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,080
uh better understanding about how

767
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,799
vulnerabilities affect your environment

768
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,320
um and i think that takes me

769
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,480
right to i think i've got five minutes

770
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,440
left

771
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,559
um so

772
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,840
uh i wanted to put my linkedin up there

773
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,320
uh seriously reach out to me on linkedin

774
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
uh i really mean that genuinely if you

775
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,159
have questions and i can't answer them

776
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,200
in this session

777
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,760
uh please reach out to me because i'm

778
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,600
happy to talk more about this

779
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
um and happy to bore anyone for hours on

780
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,440
end

781
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
if you want to talk about vulnerability

782
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,600
chaining or low and medium

783
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
vulnerabilities

784
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,360
and that will wrap it up for me thank

785
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,200
you guys thank you everybody for coming

786
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
um and i don't know if we have any

787
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
questions

788
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,240
thanks nikki uh not necessarily a

789
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,520
question but there's a comment um

790
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,960
compliance bangs that drum with you

791
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,799
oh compliance banks that drum with me

792
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,320
that's great

793
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,240
i i'm always happy to have anybody else

794
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
out there that's that's banging a drum

795
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,159
to

796
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,960
um yeah compliance is compliance is

797
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,760
tricky too

798
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
um and certainly uh it's one of those

799
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,600
things that

800
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
you know from the security engineering

801
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,919
and architecture space it's like how do

802
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,480
we help

803
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,919
people um understand

804
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,000
the importance of it and the complexity

805
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,520
of it without

806
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,960
you know kind of turning people off and

807
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
making sure people understand that like

808
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,159
hey this really is important

809
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,000
and i want to help you fix this that's

810
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,750
the other thing too

811
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,200
[Music]

812
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
i don't see any other questions i do

813
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,480
have one myself though sure

814
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,320
you know speak speaking of vulnerability

815
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,720
management and um

816
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,559
would you say it would be better for an

817
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,720
organization to kind of outsource that

818
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,440
to

819
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,720
maybe prevent any biases for their their

820
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
posture and their

821
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,120
their technology

822
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,760
i think it depends on the industry

823
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,240
because you

824
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,559
when you're outsourced yeah i guess it

825
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,000
really depends because

826
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,919
um you if you don't have a vulnerability

827
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,840
management expert or someone that's

828
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,159
you know really like deep in the weeds

829
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,679
on vulnerabilities then yes i think

830
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,200
absolutely there's a lot of great

831
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
uh companies out there and and you know

832
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,799
contractors that are trying to solve

833
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,400
this problem too

834
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,440
um so yeah if if if outsourcing is an

835
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,919
option

836
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,600
um especially if you're a small to

837
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,760
medium business and you kind of need to

838
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,120
you know get your feet wet with this and

839
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
just try to figure out like what kind of

840
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,440
where you're at

841
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,320
um you could hire like a v cisso or

842
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
someone for like six months

843
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,279
and have them come in and just be like

844
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,960
can you help me understand this

845
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
uh so you can do it on like a

846
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,080
contractual basis instead of hiring

847
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,120
someone you know

848
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,720
full-time with benefits and everything

849
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,760
like that you could hire someone

850
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,440
