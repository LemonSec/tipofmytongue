my name is david gilman i'm currently a

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,520

at mparticle we are the after mentioned

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
rapidly growing customer data platform

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,280
startup i've also worked at favorite

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,920

which is owned by epd so this is san

43
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,600
antonio i'm sure some of you are

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
familiar with that acquisition and

45
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
maybe even we talked pads previously

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
and before that i had a security role at

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
a customer data platform

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,040
called or sorry another uh company

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,840
called bicep

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,879
catalog company that was mentioned

51
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,000
and then i have a degree from texas a m

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and finishing up my master's online at

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
georgia tech

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
you can find me on twitter at prime

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,720
mover an infrequently updated twitter

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,920
account

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,040
for any questions or if you want to

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,599
reach out and network after or

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,959
on linkedin or elsewhere i'd love to

60
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
chat

61
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,879
so a few disclaimers given the nature

62
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,160
and the uh

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,040
provocative title of my talk first of

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
all don't actually like cheat or steal

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,760
i think it's important to you know in

66
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
the workplace i'm certainly not enjoying

67
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,920
being a sociopath or machiavellian in

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,000
your approach to workplace politics

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
i'd definitely advocate for a

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,280
collaborative approach over anything

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
else

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,840
and of course these are my own views

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
they don't necessarily represent my

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
employer my boss or

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
any of the companies that i've worked

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,239
out in the past

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
so a little bit of an overview i would

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
like just to talk about what we'll be

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,519
talking about

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,440
um as well as each of the categories of

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,879
my talk

82
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,720
this i think presentation is most

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
relevant for those of you who work at

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,599
software startups or small and growing

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,319
businesses in the b2b or b2c space

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,480
i think it also could be relevant for

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
smbs where maybe the security program is

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
becoming modernized as of course

89
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,799
software is eating everything

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
so more specifically what i wanted to

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
discuss today is obviously growing your

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
security program at a startup

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,760
so today your security program

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,879
is small maybe non-existent

95
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
but you want it to grow and i'm trying

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,400
to answer that question of how you can

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
you go about that effectively

98
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,280
and who might you be in this situation

99
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
so you might be the first or only

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,799
security engineer at a startup

101
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,799
uh you might have a title like security

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,799
manager cso but you have a small or

103
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,319
non-existent team

104
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
or you might be someone who would like

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,519
to do any of these things

106
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,360
i actually sort of got my start on this

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
journey that i'll be talking about today

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
when i was attending lazcon i watched an

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,880
awesome talk by a gentleman named leaf

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,919
about being the first security engineer

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,000
and later that day i got a call offering

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
me a job to do just that

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
so maybe you'll have a similar

114
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
experience taking the lessons learned

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,960
from this and getting to apply them in

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,599
your own journey

117
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,840
uh so welcome to security at a startup

118
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,240
um

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,360
you're probably already familiar with

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
this but you'll start out you know

121
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,560
implementing some policies and

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
procedures

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
fix some glaring security uh issues and

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,680
if you are a b2b startup then you're

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
probably responding to endless customer

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,000
security

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,479
questionnaires that no one will actually

128
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,960
ever read

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
if this is where you're currently at or

130
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,720
you're just looking for some other

131
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
resources here are a few

132
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,759
so there's that aforementioned glass

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,840
contact by leaf i found this to be a

134
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,199
really good touch

135
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,240
stone when i was first getting started

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
as like a security team of one and he

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
has a lot of great resources in the

138
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,199
slides

139
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,800
there's a company called screen that has

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
rasp and laugh products

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,479
they were recently acquired and their

142
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
websites now become just a big

143
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
announcement of their acquisition

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,880
but i found that their marketing

145
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,479
materials essentially were really really

146
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,840
useful so they published these

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
checklists

148
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
sas cto security checklist cso security

149

150
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,919

151
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,039
checklist

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,720
they're kind of hard to find now maybe

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,639
archive.org but this is the link i found

154
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
to one of them that have been archived

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
i found these really useful also if

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,759
you're unfamiliar

157
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,720
latakora is a company that specializes

158
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,039
in

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,360
consulting um for security for startups

160
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,840
and so their blog is really well written

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,759
and has a lot of great articles

162
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,759
i've seen them reference quite a bit and

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,880
i've referenced them myself

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,360
so let's say you've had this role for

165
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,199
about a year

166
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,479
you've impressed your boss with your

167
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,400
security knowledge

168
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
and taught employees not to respond to

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
emails from the ceo asking for walmart

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
gift cards and hopefully the engineering

171
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,600
team doesn't hate you

172
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,720
well what now

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
so probably thinking about growth at

174
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,639
this stage

175
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,440
why grow it all i think it's important

176
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,199
to consider do you actually need to grow

177
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,880
i wouldn't advocate growing for growth's

178
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
sake um but there's a few categories i

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
think would

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,319
a few different reasons why you might

181
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,840
have legitimate reason to need to grow a

182
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,600
security game so the first of all

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
first of all is if you're in security

184
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
engineering cloud security engineering

185
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,039
would be to support a growing

186
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
engineering team it's going to be more

187
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,759
code review

188
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,919
more code to review there's going to be

189
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,759
more need for automation to support that

190
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,280
growth efficiently

191
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
you might also in a b2b company have

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,039
sales growth

193
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
so there's more fun rfp excel sheets to

194
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,160
fill out

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,039
uh there's more sales calls to sit in on

196
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,080
and there's just more volume of

197
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,599
day-to-day work

198
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,759
and then also missing expertise so as we

199
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,440
all know some

200
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,039
job description writers might not but as

201
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,720
we all know there's no such thing as a

202
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
unicorn security engineer security

203
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,840
professional

204
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,599
and i guarantee whatever experience you

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,280
have there's something missing or

206
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,120
something you're not as strong in

207
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,560
so bringing in that extra

208
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,840
expertise could be really really

209
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,120
valuable especially if there's literally

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,759
only one of you

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,759
so what are some challenges to growth

212
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,440
and why might you be attending a talk

213
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,000
like this

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,479
to learn more about it well of course

215
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,919
budget is always finite

216
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
and in most businesses security costs

217
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,319
money doesn't make money you'll know if

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
your exception to this a security

219
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,599
consulting business for example

220
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,759
of some kind or a security vendor but at

221
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,919
almost all of our employers

222
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,840
we are costing the company money to

223
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,240
employ us

224
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
there's also almost always more exciting

225
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,599
things for leadership to invest in

226
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
sometimes there's exceptions to this if

227
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
a cto

228
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
has some background in security and they

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
really pride themselves on taking it

230
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,879
seriously

231
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,360
or maybe they lived through a company or

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,879
career ending incident

233
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,800
but generally speaking it's much more

234
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
interesting for them to invest in

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
new features a bigger sales team

236
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,800
a cool new office and also this is a

237
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,759
hard truth but

238
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
in almost all cases security incidents

239
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,200
are not company ending

240
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,679
we can all think of dozens of incidents

241
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,080
high profile ones many of which were

242
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,799
arguably due to negligence under

243
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
investment by leadership

244
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
in security and yet those companies are

245
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
many of them most of them are still

246
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
have gone on to ipo have high market

247
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,440
capitalizations

248
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
continue to do business so understanding

249
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,839
the prioritization of security

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,200
it's important to put that in context

251
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
and also if you're doing your job well

252
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
or you're just lucky

253
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,279
then from leadership's perspective there

254
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
might be no indication that you need

255
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,120
more money

256
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,000
it's kind of a hard truth but security

257
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
there's obviously a certain randomness

258
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
aspect to it and so

259
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
if you just haven't had to deal with an

260
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
incident then or you've dealt with

261
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
incidents

262
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
well then from leadership's perspective

263
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
you know we're handling things great

264
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,560
there's no issue

265
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
so how to grow i would say you know just

266
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
ask for more money

267
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
it's that simple thank you for coming to

268
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
my talk

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,160
all right well if that approach has not

270
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,519
solved your problem in the past then i'm

271
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
hoping to give you some more actionable

272
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,600
ways to approach this problem and i'm

273
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,760
broken them down with a pithy title

274
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,040
begging borrowing and stealing so

275
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
and i would describe these categories as

276
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,480
begging is basically how to ask your

277
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,120
boss better

278
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,839
borrowing is finding partners in your

279
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,480
organization

280
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
and stealing is finding ethical and

281
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,920
legal ways

282
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,360
to save money head count

283
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,120
so begging this is usually the first and

284
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
last step for security engineers much

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
like my gift from earlier

286
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,519
asking for money please you might ask

287
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,680
your boss for a big pen test budget or

288
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,800
that six figure

289
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,120
bunk license that you really want they

290
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
agree they take it to

291
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,399
the annual budget meeting and they come

292
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,800
back empty-handed this year's just

293
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
uh you know maybe 2020 was a rough year

294
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,399
maybe 20 was a great year

295
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,399
either way there's money that needs to

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,079
be invested in other things

297
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,040
uh there's bigger fish to fry aws costs

298
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
are always going up

299
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,719
gotta get those margins down margins up

300
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,360
so how can we as security professionals

301
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,120
address this in a way that will actually

302
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,440
get the business to listen does

303
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
is another one of those sort of hard

304
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
truths but securities don't exist just

305
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,000
to have good security

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,680
companies exist generally speaking to

307
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
make money

308
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
and if you think that security is

309
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
important you need to articulate why

310
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,760
in a dollar incense way to do that you

311
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,720
need to understand

312
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
how the business thinks about money and

313
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
how it goes about spending it

314
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
so why might a company spend money on

315
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,880
security

316
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,560
here's a few reasons you may be familiar

317
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
with some of these already but

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,399
maintaining voluntary compliance like

319
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,200
saktu lans customers

320
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,040
uh obviously some of these are more b2b

321
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,959
or some more b2c

322
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,560
customers might also leave after a

323
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
public incident i think this is true

324
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,600
both b2b and bsc

325
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,200
bad press is bad in most cases

326
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
bad press if you're a private company or

327
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,560
public company can scare away investors

328
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,440
violating gdpr or other privacy laws can

329
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,279
lead to loss of access to markets or

330
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,240
fines

331
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
and on the flip side perceived or

332
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,079
actually good security can lead to more

333
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,120
customers

334
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,480
uh that i think is an under in sensitive

335
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,120
industries

336
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,519
this is more like ever well realized but

337
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,639
it can be true in a lot of different

338
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,920
industries and that's why you see all

339
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
those marketing things about

340
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
bank rate encryption or military grade

341
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,519
encryption because

342
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,040
there's at least someone on the

343
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
marketing team thinks that saying those

344
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
sort of things is going to get more

345
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,880
customers

346
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
this can all on the other on the other

347
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,560
side sort of the

348
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
way that security might negatively

349
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,079
impact the company

350
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,200
uh you could look at things like

351
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,959
credential stuffing where even if

352
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,480
there's not technically a weakness in

353
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,760
your security

354
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,480
if someone picks up a new story from

355
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,720
social media about how your company got

356
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,200
hacked

357
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
that can also lead to customer return a

358
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,440
negative press

359
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
and you might think these matter more

360
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,720
for b2b but

361
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,480
i also really think they matter for b2c

362
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,600
especially if you're in a sense of

363
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,320
industry

364
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,320
finance date of some kind healthcare

365
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
okay so i'm gonna give a little bit of

366
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,200
risk 101. if risk is your day job or you

367
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,560
have some really strong background in

368
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,200
this

369
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
i want to just emphasize that this is

370
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,000
101 um if you want to nitpick my

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
definitions of risk and things like that

372
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
i'm happy to take comments and questions

373
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,839
but

374
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,760
even this basic understanding really

375
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,040
helped me

376
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,760
so risk in some definitions or risk

377
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,800
exposure

378
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,880
can be represented by the likelihood of

379
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
a given event in a year

380
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
multiplied by the estimated cost to the

381
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
business so

382
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,079
for a ransomware attack you might say i

383
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,760
think it'll be a ransomware attack

384
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,920
on our company successfully every 10

385
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,880
years

386
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,360
and we'll have to pay a 4.4 million

387
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
dollar ransom and bitcoin

388
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
so that works out to 440 000 annualized

389
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,519
risk

390
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,120
um also if you're not a pipeline company

391
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,600
then

392
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,880
the fbi probably is not going to get

393
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
your bitcoin back and then

394
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,240
maybe the cost will be higher it's also

395
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,720
useful

396
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,560
when you're looking at these numbers how

397
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,320
you come up with those costs

398
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,440
so a bitcoin ransom number pulled from

399
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
the headlines is easy

400
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,839
it's also useful to add on to those when

401
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,639
it comes to

402
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,639
customer churn that you're estimating so

403
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,839
loss of revenue

404
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,959
as well as person hours so

405
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,560
engineering resources and security

406
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,639
resources are quite expensive

407
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,360
pulling 10 people to work on like an

408
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
incident or potential breach

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
really adds up quickly in terms of

410
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
opportunity cost for the company

411
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,880
and you can represent that here

412
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,160
you can also talk to engineering

413
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,399
leadership legal and other departments

414
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,079
and ask them to come up with numbers

415
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,040
because

416
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,160
for one thing they might be more

417
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,920
accurate and for another they're more

418
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,839
likely to trust their numbers instead of

419
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,040
you bringing them to

420
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
them i think it can be useful to help

421
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
them come to grips with this idea and

422
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,880
i've had a great deal of success with

423
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,440
that

424
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,839
uh just by being one of the first people

425
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,800
in the startup to really talk about risk

426
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
it can also be useful to try to measure

427
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,800
these numbers over time and say a graph

428
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,399
or think of them like a kpi into

429
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,639
themselves

430
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,639
a warning though even though you sort of

431
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,920
are making up numbers

432
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,240
don't just make them up out of thin air

433
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,199
and also be clear

434
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,480
these are estimates the people you're

435
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,760
presenting them to are going to realize

436
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,560
that so

437
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
if you try to present these as some sort

438
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,480
of fixed gospel

439
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,519
it's not going to go over well

440
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,360
so a little bit more about annualized

441
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
risk so we talked about this bitcoin

442
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,000
example

443
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,120
where we've calculated our 440

444
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,040
uh thousand dollar annualized risk

445
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
you can also express this of course um

446
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,759
monthly or in a decade format but

447
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
look at how we can tie spend or budget

448
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,240
items to this risk

449
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,720
so suddenly spending let's say 20k a

450
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,440
year on

451
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,320
av licenses for our endpoints that looks

452
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,680
much more reasonable

453
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,480
especially if you look at it as only 1.7

454
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,040
000

455
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,399
cost per month this is a really great

456
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,120
way to

457
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
present these and again that's why it's

458
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,199
risky to just make up numbers you could

459
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,240
be unethical and

460
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
it would fall apart quickly to do so but

461
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,279
if you have

462
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,959
annualized risk numbers that are coming

463
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,519
from leadership they agree with

464
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,680
then when you put spend in this context

465
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,199
it really shows why

466
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,719
simple investments make sense

467
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,279
i wanted to emphasize again that even

468
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,440
though this is probably very basic

469
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,160
to some of you this level of risk

470
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,839
assessment can be game changing as

471
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,959
startup

472
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,680
people don't like things uh scary things

473
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
like cyber security or getting hacked

474
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,920
and they don't like spending money so

475
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,519
asking them to spend money

476
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,639
on cyber security is a double whammy so

477
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,680
even just having estimated numbers in an

478
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
excel spreadsheet

479
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,480
can really bring a new level

480
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,160
of a new way for them to think about

481
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,440
this and they can start thinking about

482
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
risks and cyber security in the context

483
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
of how can i actually fix this and

484
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,240
prevent it

485
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,320
not just oh it's a scary thing that i

486
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
don't want to think about

487
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,279
so talking a little bit more about risk

488
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,880
i think we're all aware of this but

489
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,760
perfect security is infinitely expensive

490
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,160
here's a quote that i'm sure many of you

491
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,439
are familiar with that i particularly

492
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:11,839
love

493
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,640
but the idea is basically there is no

494
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,839
way to secure

495
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,559
to properly secure a computer system

496
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,520
without maybe

497
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,599
dumping it into the ocean even then

498
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,880
maybe not and of course

499
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,240
it won't be available then so you

500
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,720
violated the cia try it anyway

501
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,440
so all this to say some risk is always

502
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,080
going to have to be accepted

503
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
it's better to have conversations with

504
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
your leadership about how to handle

505
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
these risks

506
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
and think about thinking about them in

507
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
context of avoiding

508
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,919
transferring mitigating or accepting

509
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,160
is also great because again there's

510
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
always going to be risk that is

511
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,039
accepted or avoided and

512
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,480
additionally you're not always

513
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
preventing risks right we're mitigating

514
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
them

515
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,000
this is the book that i found very

516
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
useful it gives a few ways to think

517
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,799
about

518
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,120
risk in a more advanced way than simply

519
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
multiplying some numbers

520
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,440
more about statistics probability and

521
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
sort of modeling

522
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,480
of course if you're going to use

523
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,679
something like this you'll have to be

524
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
able to explain it whoever's

525
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,120
reading it they probably won't just take

526
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,400
your word for it

527
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,520
but again i found it very useful risk

528
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
is its own industry and so there's lots

529
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,600
of great resources as well online

530
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,320
via podcasts and blog posts

531
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,919
so this is tangentially related to risk

532
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,720
but it can sometimes be worth it to

533
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,600
spend money

534
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,039
to spend more money uh

535
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,280
having a cyber security risk assessment

536
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,960
conducted by a third party

537
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,720
if you can get the budget for that can

538
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
give you the justification you need for

539
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,600
security investment

540
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,320
in a lot of cases unfortunately uh

541
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,919
leadership might not trust your

542
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,600
judgment that there needs to be further

543
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,440
investment but getting a small

544
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,160
investment

545
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,480
in a consulting gig could show that

546
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
uh there are gaps that need to be met or

547
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,240
that you're not meeting benchmarks by

548
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,280
your peers

549
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,200
and these sort of assessments are often

550
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
offered by firms that also do pen

551
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,039
testing or security channel sales

552
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,120
i was talking to a pen tester a former

553
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,720
pen tester co-worker of mine and he

554
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,679
confirmed this

555
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,400
he said it was ironic but having to

556
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,080
spend money justify spending more money

557
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,679
with that same company doesn't really

558
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,240
make sense from our perspective but

559
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
it can for some reason makes sense from

560
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,520
businesses perspective

561
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,879
and therefore it can be really valuable

562
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,440
okay so moving on to another subject of

563
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,799
kpis

564
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,480
um i wanted to talk first about

565
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,720
company kpis so what uh kpis or metrics

566
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
does your company care about

567
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,480
and you can determine this if you don't

568
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,799
know already by looking at

569
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,679
signs around you what kind of numbers or

570
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,520
percentages go into a bonus structure

571
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,799
promotion ladder

572
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
in sales this is very obvious usually

573
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,559
it's things like

574
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,000
deals closed average size of deal

575
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,320
a month or quarterly revenue targets

576
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,960
annual revenue targets growth

577
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
i also find it really useful to look at

578
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,640
what gets talked about every all hands

579
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,840
or town hall these are also often

580
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
metrics around growth

581
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,480
but they could be around other items as

582
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,280
well

583
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,200
and to be clear i'm not talking here

584
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,840
necessarily about security kpis but

585
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,919
i will be talking about those

586
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,880
specifically in a second

587
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
so here are a few kpis that can impact

588
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,200
security for good or for ill

589
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
things like churn rate cost to acquire a

590
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,400
customer

591
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,799
how many monthly active users we have

592
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,880
customer net promoter score

593
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,480
the annual revenue of the company or the

594
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,159
defect escape rate

595
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,120
there's obviously more to this but these

596
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,799
are ones that aren't necessarily tied to

597
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,919
security but again

598
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,919
security can have a good or a bad impact

599
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,600
on a favor an example was customer churn

600
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,880
we theorized that if there was a

601
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
security incident of some kind

602
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
or even just that example i gave earlier

603
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,080
of

604
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,120
reporting on say account takeovers

605
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
something that wasn't necessarily a

606
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
security

607
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,760
vulnerability but some sort of deficit

608
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,440
that we weren't accounting for

609
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
or that our customers weren't accounting

610
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,440
for by reusing their passwords

611
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
our churn could increase so customers

612
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,559
might see

613
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,760
that their favorite delivery app again

614
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,120
doesn't actually have issues like this

615
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,520
but if the perception of that could lead

616
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
to

617
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,799
them choosing to order from a competitor

618
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,000
and i think this is true in most

619
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
industries where there's a clear pier

620
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,400
which is true for a lot of startups and

621
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,760
then that would impact

622
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,919
one or more of these kpis which could

623
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
decrease our ability to grow

624
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
so how can you impact these kpis

625
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
in a good way you can implement security

626
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,520
sensitive features or help engineering

627
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,400
do it

628
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
to use the to use the account takeover

629
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
example for b2c

630
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,559
so you could calculate the cost of not

631
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,840
addressing an issue

632
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,320
for atos you calculate the number of

633
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,280
support hours

634
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,159
spent on ato times the number of atos

635
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,679
account takeovers

636
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,400
times how much the the business values

637
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,640
their time which is probably some

638
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,159
standard hourly wage with some

639
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,320
percentage overhead

640
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
this should be relatively easy to track

641
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
down if you have a mandate to

642
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,360
create things like risk documents but in

643
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
calculating that i can quickly add up

644
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,679
and so there's you then have in hand

645
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,120
that annualized risk

646
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,360
which may even be getting realized in an

647
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
actual annual spend

648
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,640
and you can then

649
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,720
calculate how much it might cost to fix

650
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
it so

651
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,039
one way to fix it could be those

652
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,039
security features maybe implementing a

653
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,400
form of mfa

654
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
password meter these different

655
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,159
approaches that you might use

656
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,200
to drive down account takeovers

657
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,799
therefore to drive down the spend on

658
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,559
this inside the company and then that's

659
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,400
the kind of win that

660
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,559
you can talk about at an annual review

661
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,159
of the team's performance

662
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,240
your promotion cycle or put on a resume

663
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
those are hard numbers

664
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,440
uh also on the b2b side you can

665
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,320
proactively

666
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,600
security can help practically drive

667
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,440
these kpis by

668
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
creating security materials to help

669
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,720
close sales leads

670
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
there's obviously a huge appetite

671
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
depending on the industry but

672
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,960
those endless security rfps we've

673
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,799
probably all been on both sides of them

674
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,960
and responding with a solid white paper

675
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,559
with technical details

676
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,960
can help show that your security team

677
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,400
does have a handle on things right off

678
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,120
the bat

679
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,520
also can make filling out those customer

680
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,240
questionnaires easier

681
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,799
another thing for b2b in particular is

682
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,919
tracking if there

683
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,919
are prospects or customers who've been

684
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,400
requesting security features

685
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
this should be probably tracked by

686
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,200
product in an issue tracker

687
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,400
but you should also be your own pm in a

688
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,279
lot of these cases

689
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,039
talk to people inside the company talk

690
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,720
to support talk to sales

691
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,360
find out what kind of security features

692
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,799
there's appetite for

693
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,639
that haven't been implemented

694
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,799
and then here are some security

695
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,400
incidents or sorry some metrics that

696
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,840
your boss might care about

697
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
so a number of incidents per year the

698
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,919
number of pages you're getting after

699
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,679
business hours

700
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,520
you can show them that to show why you

701
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,279
might quit if you don't grab the

702
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,880
security team

703
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,039
account takeover is in a year and then

704
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,559
also a great one's percentage of

705
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,600
vulnerabilities

706
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
passed within your existing bug sla you

707
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,120
don't have a bug sla

708
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,320
it could be a great project too a

709
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,640
number of incidents also can show poor

710
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,919
security or just

711
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
poor ability to detect issues if you

712
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,679
have a very low number of incidents then

713
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,960
you probably don't have enough detection

714
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,320
in place

715
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,799
uh i've been talking about atos a lot

716
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,480
but to me it's a good example and

717
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,360
driving them

718
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,120
those numbers was a huge win for me and

719
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
the team

720
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,400
and for both a b2b and bsc

721
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,080
uh looking at what vulnerabilities were

722
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,760
discovered at what point in the process

723
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,080
is

724
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
really valuable so that goes with that

725
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,919
whole pushing left mantra

726
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,159
uh an automation sec devops those sort

727
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,919
of buzzwords but

728
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,039
you're probably all familiar with the

729
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,120
idea that the earlier you fix

730
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,720
vulnerabilities and catch them in the

731
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,240
process the cheaper it is

732
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,840
and the better it is for security

733
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,120
because you don't want critical

734
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,279
vulnerability to be released into prod

735
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,640
much cheaper to prevent that critical

736
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,120
vulnerability by

737
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,720
catching it on a developer's workstation

738
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
before they even commit the code

739
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
and trying to measure that both for bugs

740
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
and for vulnerabilities which you can

741
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,559
think of like a subset of bugs

742
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,159
is important to measure

743
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,440
so moving on to budgeting

744
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,600
the it's important to understand how

745
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,520
your company and organization handle

746
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,360
budgeting before you can effectively ask

747
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,200
for things or at least move beyond

748
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,520
the ad hoc way of just saying hi can i

749
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,039
have 20k for this

750
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,960
hey can we spend 100k on pentesting this

751
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,640
year so

752
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
some things to figure out about how

753
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,159
budgeting works at your company

754
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,200
is how does the calendar year look like

755
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
is the fiscal year tied to the calendar

756
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,200
year is the budget broken up into the

757
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,960
first and second half

758
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
are there discretionary funds can you

759
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
get approval for some items just by

760
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
going to your boss or is there certain

761
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,120
cutoffs

762
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,760
where they'll need their boss or the cfo

763
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
to sign off on

764
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,200
security should probably be involved in

765
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
the purchasing process but if you're not

766
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,000
already familiar with it

767
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,919
understanding how that looks you're

768
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,520
going to have to get privacy legal to

769
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,480
sign off on it

770
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,159
how can you make that easier and prevent

771
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,200
it from getting slowed down

772
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,960
benchmarking i talked about this a

773
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,279
little bit earlier with the idea of

774
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,200
benchmarking against your peers with a

775
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,480
third party

776
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,159
i also find benchmarking to be a bit of

777
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
a black art i'll talk about some numbers

778
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,960
i found

779
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,480
for startups and let's say 100 to 500

780
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,520
plus

781
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,400
employee range but it's a bit of a black

782
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,720
car

783
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,240
and so if you have any great numbers on

784
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
benchmarking please let me know

785
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,240
i've had the best luck they're reaching

786
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,559
out to peers or literal competitors

787
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,240
finding out how their security teams

788
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,640
grow at different stages

789
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,600
but this is my crew diagram using

790
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,960
basically microsoft paint

791
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,279
and comic sans to illustrate a principle

792
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,559
that i found useful

793
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,279
and that if you can explain this well to

794
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,480
your leadership

795
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,039
this can be really powerful the idea is

796
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,480
that

797
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,320
as a total headcount or the engineering

798
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,039
headcount of an organization grows

799
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,399
the security headcount will need to go

800
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,799
along with it so you know 10 employees

801
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,000
there probably wasn't a need for a

802
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
security engineer

803
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,279
maybe somewhere around the uh 100

804
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
employee mark they invested in you

805
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,919
the prototypical first security engineer

806
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,240
hire

807
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,440
then at some later point you're now

808
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,559
asking to grow

809
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,399
an add-on to grow the team to more than

810
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,679
just one

811
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,200
uh this of course starts to beg the

812
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,039
question in your boss's mind of well how

813
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,240
much are we gonna have to grow how many

814
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,279
security engineers are going to be

815
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,559
running around here

816
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,720
and the good news for them is that in my

817
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
experience you don't need to grow the

818
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:06,880
team

819
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,600
linearly you don't need one security

820
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,360
engineer

821
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,480
for every like 50 engineers forever what

822
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,000
you can do is once you reach this

823
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,760
tipping point where one person isn't

824
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,960
cutting it

825
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
scale the team during that period of

826
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,039
grip some big fundraise

827
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,840
or other natural period of growth up to

828
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
maybe like

829
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,240
some some one manager size team whereas

830
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
amazon would say i get two beats a team

831
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,200
or less

832
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,080
and that will give you the foundation to

833
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
build out things like automation

834
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
and have broad expertise and you can

835
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,600
grow

836
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
much more slowly after you sort of reach

837
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,840
that foundational point

838
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,520
and again communicating this to your

839
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,360
boss will help

840
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,760
can could help convince them to invest

841
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
in the security team with the idea that

842
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,840
oh this is like this is an investment

843
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,120
we're going to make a commitment to

844
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,080
security

845
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,360
but this should give us a good

846
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,799
foundation and we won't have to just

847
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,918
keep growing at this rate

848
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,440
these are just some ratios i've seen

849
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,039
again if you have great numbers on this

850
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,960
please let me know it goes without

851
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,080
saying but

852
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,120
this can vary so much uh if

853
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,720
you're a security sensitive company and

854
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,559
not security sensitive company

855
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,559
if the cto used to be a cso

856
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,000
if the cto hates security because

857
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,760
one time they blocked him from releasing

858
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,039
a product

859
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,720
those can all influence how much the

860
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,760
business is willing to invest

861
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,120
benchmarking can be useful though if you

862
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,399
can get numbers from peers or

863
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,120
competitors

864
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,840
you can engender some of that fomo in

865
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,399
leadership

866
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,919
and say oh well our security team is

867
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,440
one-tenth the size of our competitor

868
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,640
even though our revenue is

869
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,480
pretty similar and they're going to

870
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,840
start thinking well what do they know

871
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,039
that we don't

872
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,399
they they don't want to be the ones in

873
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,080
the breed in the news for breach

874
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,240
while the competitor gets to tout their

875
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,440
excellent security program

876
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,520
so to tie together some of these themes

877
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,559
you want to tie specific risks and asks

878
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,440
together as i've kind of illustrated

879
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,080
below here

880
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,039
in a very crude budget template budget

881
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,399
request template

882
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,600
uh this is a way you might go about that

883
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,039
if there already is a budget or risk

884
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,799
template use that at your company you

885
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,799
want to speak the language

886
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,640
and yes this is primitive please do

887
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,919
better but it's it's

888
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,440
infinitely better than asking for budget

889
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
piecemeal um some things that if you've

890
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
only worked at bigger companies

891
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,720
might seem like table stakes are

892
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
can be potentially like game changing at

893
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,240
a startup just because no one's ever

894
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,480
done them before

895
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,640
also a tip don't just request what you

896
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,159
think you can get

897
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,679
request what you actually need and let

898
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,120
the business decide what risk they want

899
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,159
to accept

900
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,279
this is a don't pad your budget

901
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,320
but ask for anything reasonable

902
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,159
you can add prioritization to that

903
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,039
possibly as well like a high medium low

904
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,559
obviously it's less likely that your

905
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,880
lows are going to get accepted but

906
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,559
it helps just from a psychological

907
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,399
negotiation perspective sometimes to

908
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,240
phrase things like that

909
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
and of course the benchmarking can

910
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,720
potentially be helpful as well

911
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,399
all right so moving on to borrowing

912
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,159
which is a topic that

913
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,080
is a little bit more broad i think than

914
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,519
the ones i put under begging

915
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,039
here's here's a few items though i think

916
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,039
fall into this category so first of all

917
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,159
security champions

918
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,200
this is a concept that

919
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,480
where designated engineers or other

920
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
employees take the lead on security

921
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
issues this could include

922
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,760
weekly or monthly syncs with the

923
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
security team um and it can be a good

924
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,279
way to get information on what's going

925
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,799
on in the company as well as

926
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,360
to disseminate more information on maybe

927
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,320
a new process

928
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,760
or a category of bone that you're seeing

929
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,000
this is purely my personal opinion but

930
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,320
i'm not a huge fan of security champions

931
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,360
maybe it's the problem is me but i've

932
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,200
had trouble making it worth the time of

933
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
engineers

934
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,679
they often have plenty to do already so

935
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,799
adding one more meeting on their

936
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,360
calendar

937
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,720
can kind of just be a pain in the ass

938
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,039
even if you're giving them free stickers

939
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,399
or t-shirts

940
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,600
and even if they attend and aren't

941
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,399
interested what i've had more luck with

942
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,399
is what i'm calling security champions

943
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,919
and quotes

944
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,360
if you've been doing security at a

945
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,120
startup or you've joined a company

946
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,159
early in its security team's

947
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,320
growth then you're already familiar with

948
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,519
the idea that

949
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,640
someone's already been doing security so

950
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,840
that might be qa doing some ad hoc pen

951
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,799
testing

952
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,480
or engineers who have been having to

953
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,799
implement authentication authorization

954
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,000
or support doing crowd prevention if you

955
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,279
talk to them which you should have

956
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,320
already done if you've been at the

957
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,279
company a year

958
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,880
in this example uh you can also kind of

959
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,000
get an assessment of whether they want

960
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,919
to keep doing more security

961
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,559
and with that communication you can find

962
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,120
out

963
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
from them if there's possible security

964
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,720
issues in the future as well as what

965
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,679
kind of skeletons are in the closet

966
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,360
there you can find allies in this all

967
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,880
over the company

968
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,600
and i've had success in areas as diverse

969
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,320
lots of in

970
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,159
engineering of course but also even in

971
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,600
legal and support

972
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
where legal would end up actually

973
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,720
looping me on risk issues just because

974
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,080
there really wasn't anyone else in the

975
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,000
company thinking about risk

976
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,919
and so when they saw issues that were

977
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,000
even only security adjacent i'd get a

978
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,880
heads up

979
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,279
and could help get feedback and input

980
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,159
and so

981
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,840
there wasn't a meeting that we attended

982
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
other than maybe a monthly sync

983
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,519
but it was just the two of us like a

984
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,240
one-on-one but um

985
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,840
even then it was still very valuable

986
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,039
caveat though don't get in trouble um

987
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,559
by getting someone to do security work

988
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,080
instead of their own work you don't want

989
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,360
to just be dragging people away from

990
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,320
their responsibilities

991
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,159
okay so this is another one that i'll

992
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,159
give some caveat at the end but

993
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,159
sharing job wrecks with job postings

994
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,559
here's a possible example maybe your

995
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,240
operations or devops team

996
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,440
needs more head count uh maybe you need

997
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,000
someone

998
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,360
to do cloud security work or

999
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,560
network security work or just do that

1000
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,320
sort of work for the security team

1001
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,719
because

1002
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,760
there's not enough capacity

1003
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,320
uh it can be possible to combine job

1004
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,359
postings

1005
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,520
to get more efficient use of head count

1006
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,879
this can look like

1007
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,639
they already have a couple recs open and

1008
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,918
you talk to them about some sort of

1009
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,599
compromise where you use one of those

1010
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,040
wrecks for this purpose but

1011
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,879
they still report into ops or maybe they

1012
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,199
actually end up reporting to security

1013
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,520
but you agree with security with with

1014
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,960
ops that maybe your team will take on

1015
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,239
some of those security

1016
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,079
tickets and responsibilities that have

1017
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,159
been on their plate

1018
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,199
it can also be going to leadership

1019
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,040
together and saying hi we're trying to

1020
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,800
make efficient use of budget

1021
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
so if we'd like to instead of asking for

1022
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
two jobs uh we're gonna be asking for

1023
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,440
one

1024
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,679
again though this can be tricky because

1025
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,119
could backfire in some

1026
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,200
organizational politics way and it could

1027
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,400
be tricky for the person

1028
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,839
being hired into the role where they

1029
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,440
might get pulled then

1030
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,599
being expected to do two jobs so

1031
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,720
it can go wrong but i would say that if

1032
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,480
you're careful with it it can also be

1033
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,359
used to your advantage

1034
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,320
also interns i put them in this category

1035
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,119
because you're sort of

1036
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,920
borrowing them from school and i also

1037
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,119
want to

1038
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,720
note you should pay your interns it's

1039
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,800
really never any excuse not to in our

1040
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,920
industry

1041
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,200
or really any industry uh so

1042
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,960
i'm not saying get free labor from

1043
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,240
interns

1044
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,480
but they can be very helpful

1045
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
this is also potentially tricky if

1046
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,320
you've ever worked with interns

1047
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,560
even a senior engineer it's kind of

1048
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,240
expected that i'll take them at least 90

1049
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,520
days to be

1050
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,440
fully productive and functional or

1051
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,720
longer

1052
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
and an intern is only going to be there

1053
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
for 90 days in most cases so it's a lot

1054
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,599
to expect someone in undergrad or

1055
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,400
graduate school

1056
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
to be productive more quickly than like

1057
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,720
a senior engineer

1058
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,960
but if you scope the projects really

1059
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
well or you have a single well scope

1060
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,760
project

1061
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,680
and even better if you can pick a

1062
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,880
project from your backlog

1063
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,720
that fits their interest and skill set

1064
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,240
by talk to them before the

1065
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,280
summer or their intern period starts

1066
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,640
then they may be able to accomplish

1067
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
quite a bit uh

1068
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,560
also i'd say having interns is very fun

1069
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,079
and rewarding so

1070
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,680
i'm always an advocate for that giving

1071
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,880
back and getting to um

1072
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,920
play like a mentorship role so

1073
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,599
an example of this for me was that we

1074
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,720
brought on an intern kind of

1075
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,000
unexpectedly

1076
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,440
and she actually completely knocked out

1077
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,200
of the park part of that was the

1078
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,839
planning

1079
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,440
uh that went ahead of time i'd attribute

1080
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,040
most of it to like her work ethic and

1081
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,079
intelligence but

1082
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,680
um part of it was that we picked a good

1083
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,000
project so we presented her with a list

1084
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
of things she might be interested in

1085
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,920
working on

1086
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,680
she picked one that she thought would

1087
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,960
would be interesting

1088
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,040
and then over the course of summer the

1089
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,000
summer finished

1090
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,160
it it was a complete success it's not

1091
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,200
part of our

1092
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,040
product that customers see pretty much

1093
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,000
every time they use the app

1094
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,720
and a little bit more about budgets so

1095
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,839
budgets can be

1096
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,960
sort of borrowed or shared um

1097
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,800
it might be a tool that both you and i t

1098
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,480
want like an evr tool

1099
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,520
or some sort like a jam for something

1100
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,800
or cloud security tool when you're

1101
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,040
talking to your devops or ops team

1102
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,480
these items might make more sense on

1103
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,560
their budget but only if they agree

1104
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
don't steal people's budgets you

1105
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,599
probably won't be able to get away with

1106
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:25,920
that

1107
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,560
anyway without maybe doing some phishing

1108
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,240
getting their credentials

1109
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,720
uh this works for a few reasons

1110
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,599
potentially

1111
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,119
one is that cloud spend is pretty

1112
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,800
elastic and

1113
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,079
it's almost always going to be with an

1114
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,960
existing vendor like aws or gcp

1115
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,880
so while you shouldn't go hiding things

1116
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,800
in like some sort of slush fund

1117
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,240
saying oh we're going to add this

1118
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
specific spend to

1119
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,359
our aws bill every month to pay for

1120
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,400
uh increased blogging of some kind or

1121
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,839
maybe guard duty

1122
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,920
that's often a lot easier to stomach

1123
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,520
than asking for some specific

1124
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,800
third-party tool that's going to create

1125
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,599
a new vendor relationship and a contract

1126
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,560
uh this is basically exactly what we did

1127
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,040
uh and that i've done in the past is

1128
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,800
not hiding these projects but including

1129
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
them in existing cloud spend with

1130
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,680
existing vendors

1131
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,079
and for ops it could also be a win like

1132
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,599
implementing a sim or some sort of

1133
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,040
logging solution

1134
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,960
can help them out even more than it

1135
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,640
helps you out but

1136
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,839
bringing that uh request together shows

1137
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,359
that it's like efficient use of budget

1138
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,320
all right this one's a bit

1139
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,440
counterintuitive but shrinking to grow

1140
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,480
i put this under borrow because you can

1141
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,960
you're borrowing capacity from other

1142
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,680
teams

1143
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,920
again don't dump work on other people

1144
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,520
these are all need to be

1145
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,640
done ethically and empathetically but

1146
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,599
sometimes it can be a win for both teams

1147
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,160
um

1148
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,920
if you're a security engineering team

1149
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,000
and you've gotten saddled or in my case

1150
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,839
for some reason jumped on the hand

1151
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,560
grenade that is i.t security

1152
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,640
consider not doing it anymore with the

1153
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,119
approval of the other team and your boss

1154
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,640
and this was a huge net win for me

1155
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,480
personally i'd spent probably a year

1156
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,920
trying to do it security

1157
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,520
and it just didn't really make sense

1158
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,839
it's not a strength for me and

1159
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,640
it really was belong more in like the at

1160
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,520
department

1161
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,760
and it turns out it didn't really want

1162
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,960
to give it up either

1163
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,880
so we just agreed that they would handle

1164
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,320
it everyone agreed to this

1165
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,720
and instead a security team would just

1166
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
engage with it

1167
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,200
on specific projects um and with a

1168
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,680
monthly sync one-on-one sync

1169
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,240
but we no longer had to worry about not

1170
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,520
being successful at something like

1171
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,440
rolling out av where we didn't have the

1172
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,599
background or the capability or access

1173
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,200
to the tools to do that kind of work

1174
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,520
so to summarize this section working

1175
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,599
with your existing co-workers and teams

1176
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,880
can really get you quite a bit of

1177
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,839
capacity consider sharing budget

1178
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,560
and headcount for tools or individuals

1179
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,640
which can benefit multiple teams

1180
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,640
and also grow the security capabilities

1181
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,680
in your i.t

1182
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,839
your ops or engineering or other teams

1183
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,000
all right so lastly i want to touch on

1184
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,359
the most potentially

1185
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,760
exciting topic of stealing

1186
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,680
so one thing you can steal are disasters

1187
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
whether they're happening at your own

1188
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,599
company your competitors your peers

1189
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,079
never let a good crisis go to waste

1190
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,520
don't give into fud

1191
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,800
but a little bit of fudge to be healthy

1192
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,240
uh it can be extremely persuasive to

1193
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,599
show larger companies having these

1194
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,240
incidents

1195
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,000
um we had a large competitor in our

1196
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,839
space that had some bad press

1197
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,640
and then actually a breach and showing

1198
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
that large companies with larger

1199
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,680
security teams than us

1200
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,520
in the same industry the same type of

1201
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,560
data could suffer these sort of attacks

1202
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,200
showed that we needed to invest more in

1203
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,920
security

1204
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,920
and that there was good reason to do so

1205
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,240
so

1206
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,760
make sure these relevant these stories

1207
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,200
are relevant your company though you

1208
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,400
don't want to just like pull out

1209
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,520
colonial pipeline

1210
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,319
or that meat packing uh plant story that

1211
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,520
happened recently

1212
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,040
and say oh this is why we need to invest

1213
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,160
and they're going to look at you and say

1214
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,680
that's like a ransomware attack that

1215
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,560
doesn't really be anything to do with us

1216
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,160
no the more relevant the better that's

1217
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,000
why the competitors is particularly

1218
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,400
useful

1219
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,200
so other things to steal our information

1220
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,079
and strategies

1221
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,280
please steal this talk uh by using the

1222
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,400
ideas in it

1223
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,560
conferences and meetups peers on twitter

1224
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,000
buying people launched this is just good

1225
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,520
advice in general

1226
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,960
when it comes to growing your career no

1227
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,839
matter the industry but particularly in

1228
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,000
security

1229
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,480
but when i went from being just an ic to

1230
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,599
someone

1231
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,960
who was in the process of growing and

1232
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,040
building a security team this

1233
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,119
became completely invaluable to me

1234
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,720
and also i found of course people in

1235
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,400
security are very open to

1236
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,280
helping out peers and people more junior

1237
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,079
to them

1238
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,800
so i got had the opportunity to meet

1239
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,480
with cesos and heads of security at very

1240
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,160
large companies and just talk to them

1241
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
and say you know at a high level here's

1242
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,000
my situation how have you successfully

1243
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,440
fought these battles in the past have

1244
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,280
you grown a security team

1245
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,079
effectively how do you you know do

1246
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,440
mentorship effectively work with

1247
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,160
engineering effectively

1248
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,960
also worst case if things get really bad

1249
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,359
at your

1250
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,720
current company it might lead to job

1251
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,119
offers from those mentors down the road

1252
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,000
so can't hurt

1253
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,720
also negotiation isn't really stealing

1254
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,200
but i thought i'd put it in this section

1255
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,800
there's lots of great resources on

1256
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,319
negotiation i think

1257
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,680
most people probably have a favorite

1258
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,920
self-help book on the topic

1259
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,760
good places to practice of course are

1260
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,520
buying a car or selling something on

1261
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,640
craigslist

1262
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,720
but it's important to know you can

1263
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,839
always negotiate

1264
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,160
with software vendors don't settle for

1265
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,440
the list price

1266
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,119
you should get competing quotes and you

1267
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,880
should willing to walk away this was

1268
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,280
also

1269
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,119
specific to my experience as a favor but

1270
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,400
when i joined we'd actually been

1271
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
acquired already

1272
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,520
and so we had a parent company that we

1273
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,680
could often get bundled pricing with

1274
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,599
your this is less applicable to most

1275
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,440
startups to a true startup

1276
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,359
for sure but i wanted to include it

1277
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,720
because it was really valuable for us

1278
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,160
it's also this is one of those topics

1279
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,760
that their entire books about

1280
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,920
and i could definitely give its own

1281
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,200
presentation on but

1282
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,240
building versus buying so all products

1283
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,480
have a build versus by decision

1284
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,200
um with security feature sets and tools

1285
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,920
products

1286
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,800
this is also relevant so figuring out

1287
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,400
whether to do it yourself or

1288
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,280
steal by buying it from someone is an

1289
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,720
important decision

1290
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,319
there's security implications these as

1291
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,079
well right like rolling your own off

1292
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,880
versus buying some sort of sas product

1293
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,280
like

1294
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,560
cognito or all zero that

1295
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,079
there's security pros and cons to those

1296
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,480
approaches

1297
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,560
but there's also decisions around cost

1298
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,480
and research resources

1299
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,079
mfa for example there are plenty of

1300
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,000
vendors who will pay you can pay to

1301
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,599
handle mfa for you

1302
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,040
some of them though are basically just

1303
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,640
selling the ability to send emails with

1304
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,560
like a securely generated

1305
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,280
url or token you can definitely show

1306
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,560
yourself in the foot with that but it's

1307
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,160
also the kind of work that at a certain

1308
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,280
scale

1309
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,000
can be worth doing yourself so while

1310
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,760
this needs to be carefully done

1311
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,000
and the security implications have to be

1312
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,119
considered

1313
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,520
doing something yourself can be a good

1314
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,480
use of

1315
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,200
your own time and budget

1316
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,359
also this one's the most obvious use of

1317
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,720
steel i think

1318
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,319
finding co-workers who want to join your

1319
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,839
team

1320
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,760
again be careful you can't just pull

1321
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,520
people off of their existing work

1322
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,960
without approval from your boss their

1323
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,440
boss but this can be really great

1324
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,520
one of my most rewarding experiences in

1325
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,280
the journey of growing a security team

1326
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,400
from just myself

1327
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,520
and to a few people was

1328
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,280
bringing someone from the qa team into

1329
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,200
security so they're pretty well tenured

1330
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,040
qa professional uh and at the company as

1331
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,520
well

1332
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,839
so they were a huge resource to me but i

1333
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,440
found that when i joined they were

1334
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,520
starting to kind of handle some of those

1335
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,560
pen testing and security

1336
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,599
responsibilities

1337
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,520
because they found it really interesting

1338
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,960
so i started out just informally

1339
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,839
mentoring them

1340
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,720
but with approval that turned into a

1341
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,440
split roll

1342
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
where they spent half their time on qa

1343
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,880
and half on security

1344
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,280
and while there were some bumpy parts of

1345
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,119
that journey for sure

1346
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,640
it ended up working out and they ended

1347
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,240
up moving to security and sort of a

1348
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,240
lateral promotion to security engineer

1349
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,920
so that was a huge win for that person's

1350
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,000
career and their life but also as a huge

1351
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,520
win for security because

1352
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,800
that early we probably wouldn't have

1353
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,880
been able to get a job wreck for

1354
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,280
someone with that sort of experience and

1355
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,800
of course their knowledge of the company

1356
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,240
and quality assurance was really

1357
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,720
invaluable

1358
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,040
so to summarize uh negotiate with your

1359
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,000
vendors

1360
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,839
and consider bringing co-workers from

1361
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,520
other parts of the company to security

1362
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,079
if you can figure out a good way to do

1363
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,319
so

1364
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,400
so summarize the whole

1365
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,839
presentation i'd advocate for begging by

1366
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,680
building a risk assessment framework

1367
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,480
tying your ass to your mitigations

1368
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,760
borrowing

1369
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,960
by working with other teams and stealing

1370
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,720
by finding opportunity to get head count

1371
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,520
and budget where you can find it

1372
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,520
of course i couldn't end my talk without

1373
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,280
plugging the fact that we are hiring

1374
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,960
um we'll be opening some security job

1375
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,040
wrecks to uh soon

1376
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,319
probably an application or cloud

1377
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,160
security so if you're interested please

1378

1409
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,599
ceo of innocent lives foundation

1410
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,200
the innocent lives foundation is an

1411
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,960
organization that i started that is made

1412
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,760
up of

1413
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,640
security professionals that want to help

1414
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,640
save children from the horrors of child

1415
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,359
abuse

1416
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,520
hi my name is shane mccombs and i am the

1417
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,359
chief operations officer for the

1418
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,440
innocent lives foundation

1419
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,720
the vision of the ilf is to protect

1420
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,920
innocent children from anyone

1421
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,079
who supplies and trades in child abuse

1422
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,000
material we use our skills

1423
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,640
to uncover and unmask those who try to

1424
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,640
anonymously hide online

1425
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,119
while spreading producing and profiting

1426
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,960
from child abuse material we were able

1427
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,839
to collect

1428
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,760
security professionals from around the

1429
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,920
globe that are experts in their

1430
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,040
particular field

1431
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,359
we have people that have mastered osint

1432
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,359
or open source intelligence gathering

1433
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,000
we have expert coders we have expert

1434
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,079
exploit writers we have people that have

1435
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,839
really mastered these areas of their

1436
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:30,559
field

1437
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,040
and they have come to donate their time

1438
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,559
in order to help us

1439
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,880
unmask these anonymous child predators

1440
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,920
well one of our

1441
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,680
core principles at the innocent lives

1442
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,680
foundation is to never do

1443
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,960
anything illegal the ilf is a

1444
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,119
non-vigilante

1445
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,160
organization so we work within all of

1446
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,880
the laws

1447
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,040
that are appropriate and in fact one of

1448
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,000
the principles that we have internally

1449
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,880
is that we work hard to remain above

1450
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,559
reproach

1451
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,920
meaning that obviously we're not going

1452
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,559
to cross the line

1453
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,480
but ideally we don't even want to get

1454
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,920
close to the line

1455
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,000
if there's a gray area we do everything

1456
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,599
in our ability to be sure that we are

1457
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,000
not

1458
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,240
in the gray area and therefore staying

1459
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,520
above reproach

1460
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,440
because the goal is to get this guy off

1461
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,640
the street

1462
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,800
and what good will it do for us to

1463
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,240
unmask someone

1464
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,559
for him to just be turned out loose

1465
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,599
later

1466
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,760
because we didn't follow the rules if we

1467
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,359
were to perform one illegal act while

1468
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,640
catching a predator

1469
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,480
law enforcement would not be able to use

1470
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,240
the information that we hand over

1471
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,520
which would make all of that work

1472
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,000
useless and that person can walk free

1473
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,680
even worse than walking free they now

1474
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,599
may be armed with information

1475
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,079
and become even a smarter predator so as

1476
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,200
we do the work

1477
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,119
we want to be able to give them a file

1478
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,040
that file should contain the 10

1479
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,839
50 100 steps that it took us to connect

1480
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:52,800
that online

1481
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,359
anonymous perpetrator with a real person

1482
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,400
one of our core

1483
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,640
goals is to make sure that we produce a

1484
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,040
file that can walk any law enforcement

1485
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,599
agent

1486
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,839
through every step that we take legally

1487
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,520
so they come to the same conclusions

1488
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,400
that we do

1489
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,480
our main focus is being able to save law

1490
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,599
enforcement the

1491
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,000
hundreds of hours of time all the time

1492
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,280
effort and energy that they would have

1493
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,040
had to put into that case

1494
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,920
in order to find that predator when we

1495
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,839
do that then we consider that a win and

1496
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,599
we consider that a case that we can hand

1497
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:22,079
over

1498
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,319
so the ilf has a couple methods where a

1499
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,319
case comes to our attention first of all

1500
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,760
we have a report a case button on our

1501
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,880
website

1502
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,640
that section of the website can be used

1503
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,319
by law enforcement or even

1504
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,480
just by civilians that know of child

1505
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,400
abuse cases or child abuse material

1506
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,280
online

1507
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,599
they can report it to us and then we

1508
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,680
will work that case or hand it over to

1509
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,680
the appropriate law enforcement agency

1510
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,760
the second way that we hear about cases

1511
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,520
is many times law enforcement agencies

1512
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,480
will come to us

1513
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,880
within those leads those are the ideal

1514
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,400
ones because we're able to

1515
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,040
lend and assist immediately upon request

1516
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,720
maybe a local law enforcement agency

1517
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,720
that doesn't have the budget for ocean

1518
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,800
experts or doesn't have the online

1519
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,720
expertise that we have in-house

1520
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,319
so they'll come to us and say hey we

1521
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,400
have this case we're not a dead end

1522
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,000
is there any way you can help us figure

1523
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,440
out x y and z

1524
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
when we successfully get to work with a

1525
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,280
law enforcement agency it makes us feel

1526
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,000
so good

1527
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,599
that we were able to help them

1528
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,040
accomplish their job and

1529
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,720
from the work that we've done so far

1530
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,400
we've gotten incredibly positive

1531
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,200
feedback

1532
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,800
from the law enforcement agencies that

1533
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,960
we've had a privilege of working with

1534
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,640
and helping them close those cases but

1535
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,400
more often than not

1536
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,400
we are able to find leads by going out

1537
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,839
and looking

1538
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,800
on the internet seeing people already

1539
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,200
doing

1540
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,760
horrible things to kids those people are

1541
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,200
in the public

1542
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,920
and therefore they may become an

1543
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,720
appropriate lead

1544
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,960
we have a group of our volunteers that

1545
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,400
actually spend time

1546
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,319
looking at different forms where people

1547
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,640
try to hide child abuse material

1548
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,880
when our volunteers find people that are

1549
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,640
uploading child abuse material

1550
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,119
we make that user name a case and then

1551
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:57,839
we'll assign

1552
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,000
one of our crew that will then start to

1553
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
oscent or look online at that open

1554
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,280
source intelligence

1555
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,200
at that username and see if they can

1556
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,040
connect that to a real-life person

1557
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,720
of course all of this work even with

1558
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,319
donated time

1559
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,960
costs some money the servers that we run

1560
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,040
the tools that we need and the people

1561
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,559
that are running the innocent lives

1562
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,559
foundation were able to accomplish all

1563
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,359
of that

1564
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,160
because of voluntary donations every

1565
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:22,640
cent

1566
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,200
that everyone donates goes directly back

1567
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:25,680
in

1568
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,920
to running the organization and being

1569
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,160
able to put predators behind bars while

1570
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,760
working closely with law enforcement to

1571
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,000
do

1572
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,480
so donations are used to meet the needs

1573
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,680
of the technology

1574
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,400
that is used on the hunt but it's also

1575
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,119
used

1576
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,280
to help protect our volunteers

1577
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,040
psychologically to be sure that they're

1578
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,760
getting

1579
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,480
the wellness treatment that they need to

1580
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,200
help them

1581
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,680
stay balanced and emotionally fit so

1582
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,440
they can continue to do this incredible

1583
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,079
work

1584
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,480
we have done so much more because people

1585
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,400
have donated our very first year that we

1586
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,760
started ilf

1587
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,359
and we were so excited about this we

1588
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,359
were able to close nine cases that means

1589
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:02,000
that we had

1590
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,920
nine files that we were able to hand off

1591
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,760
to law enforcement where we were able to

1592
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,640
uncover

1593
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,000
and identify a child predator the very

1594
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,280
next year because of

1595
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,200
all the donations and all the support

1596
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,280
that we got from people like you

1597
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,319
we were able to hand in over 75 cases

1598
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,599
that next year

1599
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,359
the increase was mind-blowing and that

1600
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,800
was because we were able to add more

1601
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,839
volunteers

1602
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,319
more technology more tools and all of

1603
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,000
that added up into closing more

1604
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,559
cases to help save more kids there's a

1605
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,559
tremendous number of organizations out

1606
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,640
there are doing phenomenal work

1607
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,240
if you feel that our mission

1608
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,559
is in alignment with your core values

1609
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,319
then we would love to have you donate to

1610
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:42,960
us

1611
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,319
a study in 1995 tells us

1612
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,640
that one predator may affect the lives

1613
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,920
of up to 400 children

1614
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,480
that means when the child predator you

1615
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,680
helped unmask

1616
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,920
is a serial predator you may be helping

1617
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,119
to protect up to

1618
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:11,839
400 children

1619
