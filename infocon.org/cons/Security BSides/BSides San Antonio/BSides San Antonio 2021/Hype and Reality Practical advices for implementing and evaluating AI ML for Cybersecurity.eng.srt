00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:05,920
hello

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,200
my name is edward and today i'm going to

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,000
talk about

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
high-penned reality practical advice for

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,920
implementing and evaluating aiml for

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,800
cyber security

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
a quick disclaimer before we get started

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,480
see opinions expressing this

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,039
presentation are my own

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,279
and do not reflect the view of my

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,840
employer

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,960
one slide about myself i'm currently the

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,920
aiml

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,840
and detection lead at actual hub

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
networks

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,920
i founded extrahop's cloud ml behavioral

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
attack detection service six

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,920
years ago and i previously worked

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
on automated binary analysis and

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,239
software defenses

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,399
at uc berkeley and uw seattle

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,080
finally a bit of fun fact about myself

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,720
i built the first working remote code

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
execution exploit

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,200
for juice bonnet a decade ago while i

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,280
was working as an undergrad research

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,760
assistant

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,759
my talk today is going to split into two

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,799
sections

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,280
in the first section i'm going to talk

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,799
about what aiml can

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
and now do in cyber security today

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
and for the second section i'm going to

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
talk about a set of recommendations for

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,759
practitioners who are either

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
implementing or evaluating

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,159
aiml-based cybersecurity solutions

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,560
so let's start it with the height

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,920
so the first type we're going to talk

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,840
about

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,320
is the claim of having

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,560
a single holy grail machine learning

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
algorithm

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,079
that can solve all the problems in cyber

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,680
security

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,840
in reality application of aiml for

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,160
cybersecurity

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
involves solving many different problems

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,239
and as a result

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,400
different algorithms are needed to solve

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,920
different subtasks it's kind of similar

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
how autonomous driving systems does not

53
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,840
involve

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,319
a single machine learning algorithm but

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,280
instead

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,080
utilizes dozens of different ai ml

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
modules

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
on the bottom left hand side you can see

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,319
a visualization

60
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,239
or architectural diagram of udacity's

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,879
autonomous driving system and you can

62
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,000
see there are

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
a few different sub modules such as

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
perception object detection localization

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
planning and control that are working in

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
unison

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,760
to deliver the final autonomous driving

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,239
behavior

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,760
the second type

70
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,080
i want to talk about is detection with

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,280
no false positives

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
aiml based attack detection is very

73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
popular today and a lot of vendors

74
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
claim that their aiml-based solutions

75
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,760
are able to identify attacks

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,799
with no fast positives however

77
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,840
in reality even detectors based on

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
perfect data

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,519
perfect algorithm and perfect domain

80
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,720
expertise

81
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,920
will still require additional

82
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,360
human anal analysis and could still

83
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,879
generate false positives the reason of

84
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,000
that

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
is the definition of secure actually

86
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,680
varies

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
greatly across customers and

88
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
organizations

89
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,799
sometimes what separates an attack and

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,319
apk denying behavior is actually the

91
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,120
underlying

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
operation operation context

93
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,120
or the intention of the behavior for

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,159
example

95
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,000
in an environment user a performing

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,959
sifs shear enumeration will be

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,000
considered

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
as malicious but at the same time

99
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,639
the exact same behavior could be benign

100
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,080
if user a was responsible

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
for performing a new data mapping

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,639
initiative

103
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,560
and frequently during operation

104
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
a lot of these contactings are actually

105
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,280
unavailable

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,120
to the component performancy analysis

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
so it's incredibly difficult for those

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,960
perform

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,080
for those components to read operators

110
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,160
minds and understand the intention

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
of behaviors observed

112
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
the third type that you guys might have

113
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
seen a lot

114
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,520
is a claim of autonomous easy burden

115
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,840
however the reality is that the cost of

116
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
incorrect remediation

117
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
and quarantine can be extremely high

118
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,600
depending on the operation criticality

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
of the asset

120
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,240
where the false positive has been

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
identified

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
current state-of-the-art technology in

123
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,240
general is not able to

124
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
respond to attacks autonomously without

125
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
risking

126
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,320
taking down or negatively impacting

127
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,680
normal business operation

128
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,639
given that response automation can still

129
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,520
be achieved

130
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,639
in very specific environments and scope

131
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,280
but prevalence of false positives

132
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
definitely make it quite risky

133
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,160
when trying to operationalize it in a

134
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,360
very broad

135
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,000
deployment

136
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,520
we talked about a few claims

137
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,880
that are unrealistic let's now look at

138
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,800
how aiml can actually assist

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,479
in cyber security today so right now

140
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,639
aiml can already help with many

141
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,160
analytical tasks

142
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,840
and can be utilized to convert data and

143
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,080
telemetry

144
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
to actionable insights some examples

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,160
of these tasks include behavioral attack

146
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,479
detection

147
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,840
prioritization assisted investigation

148
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,360
as well as many others

149
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,400
well far from perfect most of the time

150
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,599
aiml if done right can be an extremely

151
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,759
powerful force multiplier

152
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
for security teams today

153
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
now let's look at a few of these

154
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
applications

155
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
the first application i want to discuss

156
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,160
is behavioral attack detection

157
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
in general behavioral attack detection

158
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
refers to the

159
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,039
practice of observing runtime behavior

160
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,000
of certain entities and identify

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
potential attacks

162
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,319
these entities can be executables

163
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
users devices or servers on the network

164
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,758
as well as groups of devices or subnets

165
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,440
at the same time runtime behavior can be

166
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,400
recorded

167
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,199
in many different formats for example on

168
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,639
the agent site

169
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
runtime behavior can be recorded as

170
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
binary execution trace

171
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
as well as log data such as system logs

172
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,319
application logs or vpn logs in addition

173
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:56,960
to that

174
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,160
runtime behavior can also be reported

175
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,520
in the format of netflow

176
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
as well as metadata extracted

177
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,440
from parsing network packets

178
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,479
aino for behavior attack detection is

179
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,080
actually a very popular

180
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,319
application domain compared to

181
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
traditional heuristics and rule-based

182
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,280
approaches

183
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,840
aiml-based solutions provide significant

184
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,280
advanced noise

185
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,039
and at the same time offer ability to

186
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,320
dynamically adapt to the environment

187
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
that's being protected in addition to

188
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,679
that

189
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,320
ai ml solutions are able to leverage

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
operational contacts

191
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,120
which is critical to the detection of

192
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,800
sophisticated attacks

193
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
or unknown unknowns

194
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,240
let's now look at an example of how

195
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
to detect suspicious ps exact activities

196
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,440
in the environment so

197
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
for those of you guys who are not

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
familiar with ps exact

199
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,680
it is a popular remote access tool then

200
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
enables users to access other windows

201
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,040
machines

202
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
without pre-deploying any server or

203
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,560
agent

204
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,519
it is commonly used by administrators

205
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,800
but at the same time

206
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
it's also frequently utilized by

207
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
attackers

208
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
to move laterally across different

209
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
windows machines

210
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,800
and when combined with mini cats used

211
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,160
for privilege activation

212
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,160
so in order to detect suspicious ps

213
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,360
exact

214
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,480
activities in the environment the stock

215
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
analysts or cyber defenders might start

216
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,360
with a relatively naive heuristic

217
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,839
based approach where they were just

218
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,560
alert

219
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,680
if any use of ps exact was observed in

220
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
the environment

221
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,720
it is quite obvious that this approach

222
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,320
or heuristics will be very noisy due to

223
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,800
different administrators benign users of

224
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,399
this tool

225
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,440
given that information or observation

226
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
the cyber defenders might chose to level

227
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,519
up the sophistication

228
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,760
and refine the approach by

229
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,360
adding an additional condition so that

230
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,480
the alert will not erase

231
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
if the client device is in the set of

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
known administrator laptops or

233
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
workstations

234
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
however this approach is also not

235
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
easily operationable because it requires

236
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
constant maintenance

237
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,279
as well as tuning to reduce noise caused

238
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
by other non-administrators

239
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,320
or management tools that use psxm

240
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,519
so one possibility of applying aiml

241
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,880
for the detection of suspicious ps exact

242
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
involves using unsupervised learning

243
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,560
algorithms

244
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,680
so unsupervised learning algorithms

245
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
are algorithms that can identify

246
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,519
underlying patterns in input data and

247
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,800
mark statistical outliers

248
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,680
these algorithms are commonly used for

249
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
building predictive models

250
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,839
for behind benign behaviors in the

251
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,279
environment

252
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,640
and they are capable of self-adapting

253
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,920
to changing environments for example

254
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,519
introduction of new users or devices

255
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,279
as well as changing

256
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,120
underlying behaviors conceptually

257
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
unsupervised learning algorithms are a

258
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,560
good fit

259
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,000
for implementing a

260
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,040
an unusual operator in detection rules

261
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,600
and sample and supervised algorithms

262
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,079
include

263
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,760
clustering isolation forest pca

264
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,040
and principal component analysis as well

265
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,079
as vae

266
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,519
variable auto encoding

267
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,560
so in order to apply unsupervised

268
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,360
learning

269
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,639
to enhance the efficacy and accuracy

270
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920
of suspicious ps exact detection one can

271
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
build an unsupervised machine learning

272
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,639
model

273
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,959
that actually learns the common uses of

274
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,160
ps exact

275
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,959
based on different factors over time and

276
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,959
these factors could include

277
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,560
time of use as a user

278
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
that initiated the session the client

279
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,040
device

280
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,000
the role of the client device as well as

281
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
server device

282
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
and the role of the server device

283
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
and the machine learning algorithm could

284
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,639
alert if unexpected

285
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,920
use rps exact as being as observed

286
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,720
the benefit of applying machine learning

287
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,320
for suspicious ps exact detection

288
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,079
is that this new model will be able to

289
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,120
automatically

290
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,079
adapt to different benign uses of ps

291
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,320
exact in the environment

292
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,839
across multiple factors in addition to

293
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,360
that

294
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,800
it could also help to

295
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,959
detect really subtle or potentially

296
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,160
stealthy attacks for example

297
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,440
when an iq administrator starts to run

298
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,480
px exact

299
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
from a finance machine during the

300
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
weekend

301
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
and remotely the next practical

302
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
application of aiml i want to discuss

303
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,320
is privatization today security teams

304
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,079
are always overwhelmed by alerts and

305
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,519
vulnerabilities

306
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
and good prioritization helps them to

307
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
maximize our eyes

308
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,160
of their limited time and resources it

309
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,440
also makes a lot of sense

310
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,160
because in the consumer technology wrote

311
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
the same

312
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,160
aiml based recommendation systems

313
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,199
had been widely adopted and are the

314
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,360
driving force behind many type joints

315
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
today

316
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,760
you can already see or experience a lot

317
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,279
of these systems

318
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,199
in the form of digital content

319
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,720
recommendation

320
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,600
ad targeting as well as merchandise

321
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
recommendation

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
let's look at a concrete example of an

323
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,959
alert prioritization project

324
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,079
to get started the stock analyst might

325
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,000
choose to build a rule

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,560
where alerts on devices in a specific

327
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,199
sub-map

328
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,880
should be prioritized first however it's

329
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,680
obvious

330
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,199
that this approach is not very precise

331
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,320
or accurate

332
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
because in general crowd heading alerts

333
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,800
require

334
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,360
analysis and also depends on many

335
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,160
different factors

336
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,519
a more refined heuristic approach might

337
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,320
involve

338
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
the analyst building a complex point

339
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,440
space system

340
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,079
that increases and decreases relativity

341
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,959
priority

342
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,000
based on different factors however this

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,519
approach is still very manual

344
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,680
and it's very hard to scale especially

345
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
when the number of

346
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,359
factors increases above 10.

347
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,519
so prioritization is one area where a

348
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,600
category of machine learning algorithms

349
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
called supervised learning can help

350
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,440
in general supervised learning

351
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
algorithms are capable

352
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,839
of learning the relationship between the

353
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,800
input data

354
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
and the output label supervised learning

355
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,399
algorithms

356
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,680
are already used in areas such as image

357
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,199
classification

358
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,000
spam classification optical character

359
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
recognization

360
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
as well as property price prediction

361
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,759
simple supervised learning algorithms

362
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,800
include svm

363
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,440
support vector machine linear regression

364
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,279
logistic regression

365
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,279
as well as neural networks

366
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,160
to continue on the example of the alert

367
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,279
prioritization project

368
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,519
see practitioners can leverage

369
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,880
supervised learning

370
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
to build a model that is able to

371
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,440
predict the priority of a given alert

372
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
based on a historical data set

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,839
containing manual triage alerts

374
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,240
essentially in this case the machine

375
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,199
learning

376
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,399
model will be able to infer

377
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,639
the relationship between relative

378
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,440
priority

379
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
and multiple factors by observing

380
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,279
how the analysts or the security teams

381
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,800
have triaged

382
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,839
alerts in the past

383
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
the third practical application area of

384
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,959
aiml

385
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,800
i want to touch on is assisted

386
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,399
investigation

387
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,560
it's obvious that modern security tools

388
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,400
generate a tons of alerts

389
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
and the alert investigation is often

390
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,880
extremely time consuming

391
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,559
i think there are reports saying on

392
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,359
average investigation of single alert

393
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,839
could take up to 20 or 30 minutes

394
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,199
in this area aiml can assist by

395
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,000
automating the process of context

396
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,280
gathering

397
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,319
as well as incident grouping

398
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,240
so for context gathering aiml solutions

399
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,919
are able to simulate the human analyst

400
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:36,880
behavior

401
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
of for example going to 15 different

402
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
dashboards or queries

403
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,880
and look for unusual behaviors or spikes

404
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,679
at the time of the alert for incident

405
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,480
grouping

406
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,640
aiml solutions can analyze

407
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
multiple alerts and identify whether

408
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,320
there

409
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,080
are pre-existing correlation among them

410
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,000
that might indicate some sort of

411
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,440
multi-static tech

412
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,240
campaign or a bigger incident

413
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,639
so we touched on a few

414
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,240
applications of practical applications

415
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
of aiml

416
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,679
and let's now change gears a bit and

417
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,880
talk about some recommendations

418
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
to get started i want to talk about

419
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
recommendations for practitioners

420
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,559
who are actually planning to implement

421
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,720
aiml solutions or incorporate

422
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,760
aiml to some of their operations

423
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,679
the first recommendation i have for

424
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,120
implementing aiml is the importance of

425
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,559
peculiar battles

426
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,440
in general application of aiml takes a

427
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,799
lot of resource

428
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,280
and the roi might not make sense for

429
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
certain low-value problems

430
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
in addition to that it's much easier to

431
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,120
apply aiml

432
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,600
on tasks that are already well defined

433
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
and narrowly scoped

434
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,840
associated with the existing data sets

435
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
as well as

436
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,840
can be solved or mostly solved by human

437
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,559
heuristics

438
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,840
the second recommendation i have for

439
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
implementation of aiml

440
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,880
is to focus and make sure

441
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,600
you have all three key ingredients in

442
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,160
general

443
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
successful application of aiml requires

444
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,799
a good combination and blend of these

445
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,240
three key ingredients

446
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,799
which are data data science and cyber

447
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,120
security don't make your keys

448
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,840
most of the time quality and quantity of

449
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,400
data

450
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,360
has the biggest impact on the success of

451
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,240
an aimr application

452
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,200
however one common problem i have

453
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,320
observed

454
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,280
is that a lot of times security teams

455
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,240
will hire

456
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,520
a data scientist and simply point him

457
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,799
worker to a large collection of cyber

458
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,400
security data

459
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,600
without providing the necessary

460
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,360
domain knowledge first and unfortunately

461
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,320
it's not going to work most of the time

462
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,120
because

463
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,039
in order to properly apply data science

464
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,159
the data scientists also need to have

465
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,600
a reasonably good understanding

466
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,400
of the cyber security problem he or she

467
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,760
has been taxed

468
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,919
with solving the final recommendation i

469
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,600
have around this

470
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,640
is to expect and increase hydration

471
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,760
similar to other applications of aiml no

472
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,919
machinery model or capability

473
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,320
is remotely perfect even after the first

474
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,720
time iterations

475
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
and from my experience this is this is

476
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,640
especially true

477
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,960
for cyber security applications whereas

478
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,799
a problem domain

479
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,760
is often not well understood or

480
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,159
extremely complex and dynamic

481
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,799
a good rule of thumb is to expect

482
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,280
building a prototype with 99

483
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
accuracy being only 25 percent of the

484
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
journey

485
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,720
in addition to that for aiml based

486
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
detection projects

487
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
one should expect false positive

488
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,400
reduction

489
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,080
to be the most challenging bit

490
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,000
next let's change gears a little bit

491
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,120
and talk about some recommendations

492
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,479
for vendor evaluation

493
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
there are a lot of aiml based security

494
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,320
products today

495
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
and you might have heard a lot of

496
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,159
vendors bragging about their proprietary

497
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,200
algorithms

498
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,240
or sophisticated algorithms such as deep

499
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,200
learning and neural networks

500
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,120
however in practice complex algorithms

501
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
typically require exponentially more

502
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,480
data to train

503
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
and often are not necessarily the best

504
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,559
algorithm for a given problem

505
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
from my experience applying a single

506
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,080
simple algorithm to the correct set of

507
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,120
input data

508
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
typically produces far better results

509
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,600
than applying sophisticated algorithms

510
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
to the raw data

511
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,720
for a concrete example let's look at

512
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
database

513
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,039
brute force detection in general

514
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,320
database error logs plus simple ml

515
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
algorithms

516
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,240
will typically outperform the

517
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,280
application

518
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,840
of a sophisticated algorithm like deep

519
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,440
neural networks

520
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
on data that

521
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,640
contains less signals such as tcp packet

522
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,760
links inside this

523
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,120
another recommendation i have or

524
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,320
the practitioners should look out for is

525
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,640
to pay close attention to the quality

526
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,559
and quantity of the input data

527
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,760
being used by the

528
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,280
modules a lot of times

529
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
we ingest everything is usually a yellow

530
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
flag

531
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
because effective application of aiml

532
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,960
requires

533
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,840
in-depth knowledge about the input data

534
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,640
it's actually

535
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
very very difficult to build effective

536
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,200
aiml modules

537
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,960
that will work on arbitrary data

538
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,919
in addition to that another area

539
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,440
practitioner should pay a lot of

540
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,000
attention

541
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,039
to when they're evaluating products

542
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,240
is the false positive rate

543
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,760
i've seen a lot of practitioners focused

544
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,120
heavily on fast negative rate

545
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,640
or the ability to not miss real attacks

546
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,000
during the plc's while it is extremely

547
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
important for the

548
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,400
aiml-based solution to not misreal

549
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
attacks

550
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,760
noise or the fast positive rate actually

551
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,440
is frequently overloaded in general

552
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,200
noise has a huge impact on the

553
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,840
operationalization

554
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,120
and the production efficacy of a aiml

555
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,400
product

556
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,679
because even if the product is able to

557
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,080
not

558
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,679
miss any real attacks by simply

559
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,279
generating a lot of voice

560
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,679
the product could quickly cause the

561
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,880
security teams

562
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,600
to lose confidence and stop using it

563
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,679
another factor to consider when

564
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,679
evaluating aiml products

565
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
are the scale it's obvious that aiml

566
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,039
solutions in general require a lot of

567
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
compute resources

568
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
and mature ml solutions could involve

569
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,640
dozens

570
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,760
of algorithms and millions of models per

571
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
second

572
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
there are two ways to typically deploy

573
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,559
ml solutions

574
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,080
one is to run dml algorithms and models

575
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,960
on board of some sort of on-premise or

576
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,880
virtual clients

577
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
the other way is to offload features

578
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,440
to the cloud and execute machine

579
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,200
learning models

580
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,640
in the cloud in general on board and ml

581
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
solutions are constrained

582
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,039
by the local compute resources and

583
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,559
typically perform worse

584
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,080
than the cloud-based solutions

585
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,480
and you might have concern around the

586
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,760
ability for cloud-based ml solutions

587
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,799
to be effective

588
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,200
without the access of sensitive pii data

589
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,640
however at this point there are a number

590
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,840
of techniques that could be utilized

591
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,440
to assist with ml algorithms

592
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,159
and help them to achieve very high level

593
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,120
of access

594
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,440
efficacy even without accessing

595
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,840
any sensitive pii data in think tanks

596
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,400
my final recommendation for

597
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,159
my aiml product evaluation is to test in

598
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,120
realistic environments

599
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,919
most aiml solutions are actually

600
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,120
extremely sensitive

601
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,159
to the environment because

602
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,720
similar to building physical devices

603
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,440
building

604
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,880
complex aml solutions that can operate

605
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,919
across a wide range of networks is

606
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,919
actually very difficult analogy will be

607
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,960
to build an ai doctor that is now table

608
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,080
not only able to detect diseases in

609
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,360
humans

610
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,039
but also all the way down to single

611
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,799
cell organisms we have things

612
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,320
aiml solutions that actually works

613
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,600
perfectly in small

614
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
lab environments but simultaneously

615
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,799
quickly falls apart in realistic

616
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,200
environments for example with 10 000

617
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,760
devices

618
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,720
in addition to that keep in mind that

619
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,679
many vendors

620
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,559
actually include some form of poc mode

621
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,320
in their aiml product

622
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,960
to artificially increase the sensitivity

623
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,679
for small

624
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,279
rp for small lab poc environments

625
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,320
if not clearly this goes these

626
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,799
practices are somewhat as equally

627
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,080
questionable

628
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,559
and often leads to reduced efficacy

629
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,159
post-purchase

630
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,000
because cpoc mode cannot be

631
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,520
turned down in real world deployments

632
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,200
in conclusion today aiml provides a

633
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,039
practical and scalable way

634
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,360
to automate the conversion from data or

635
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,480
telemetry

636
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,919
to actionable insights in cyber security

637
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,000
at the same time we are still at the

638
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,480
early days of applied aml

639
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,799
and i will personally characterize our

640
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,159
maturity today

641
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,720
as a form of intelligence or my

642
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
augmentation

643
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,279
and not autonomous intelligence in

644
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:25,840
general

645
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,799
aiml has been overhyped and oversold by

646
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,720
a lot of security vendors

647
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,039
but there are a few rapid role vendors

648
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,799
who have been making investments for

649
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,600
years

650
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,880
and have products that actually do what

651
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,360
they think

652
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,820
