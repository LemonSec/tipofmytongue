00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
project safe escape he's a former cia

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,279

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,880
it over to will

14

to kick things off with digital

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520
forensics and insider threat

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,360
thank you for the handoff good morning

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,680
everyone welcome to b-side san antonio

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,399
virtual

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520
hopefully the last year we do virtual

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
this first 25-minute talk is going to be

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,840
about digital forensics the insider

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,520
threat

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,199
and from that the job openings are all

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,199
digital forensics insider response and

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960
then every so often you'll see insider

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,840
threat

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,920
this is going to cover what's the career

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,520
track look like for insider threat

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,200
what does the day look like what do the

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,640
duties consist of

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
if you're interested great if not you

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
spent 25 minutes done that you didn't

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,680
like the career tracking you move on no

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
harm no foul

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
so detecting a threat it's not really

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,600
magic

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,680
there's some basic principles here doug

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
henning thank you very much

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,119
wow i don't usually talk about myself so

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,479
i'm a little surprised to let this in

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
here so

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
i worked in financial technology i went

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,759
to the intelligence community for many

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,000
many

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
years i went to nato as a public speaker

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,759
training the spatial operations forces

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
on cyber security

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,720
from there when coveted hit i went to a

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
consulting firm and began specializing

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,399
on the commercial side of the insider

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,840
threat

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
and the insider threat for commercial

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,560
gives you access to every pretty much

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
everything where

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
on the intelligence community you have a

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,040
little slice of pie you look at the

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
slice of pie you're in your stove

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,758
pipe that's all you see you don't see

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,038
the entire network

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,599
you don't see the granular details when

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,920
people log in

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,680
when they badge in when they badge out

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,879
where they go you don't see the full

64
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,360
picture of their life

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,319
incident response though at the high

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,040
level we've got the data breaches

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
it's usually external i've got the

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
picture of the dam it might be because

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
of the leaked passwords and the github

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,519
repository solarwinds1234

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,920
you've got something hitting the outside

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
of the network perimeter

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,519
causing an event to have data leak out

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
in modern terms it takes one unexpected

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,959
action to reach the firewall

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
they needed to get data out of a secure

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,879
facility on scarif

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
the rebels used a hammerhead corvette to

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
physically penetrate

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,760
the firewall the ring uh preventing

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,840
any transmission coming out from the

82
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,560
planet so we had an

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,040
external attack on the firewall data's

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,000
leaked out

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
episodes four five and six occur maybe

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
rebels maybe mandalorian

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,319
episode 789 never happened in my world

88
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,879
the insider threat we've got data loss

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,079
enabled by employees

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,319
we're not necessarily talking about a

91
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,040
event

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,120
like the colonial pipeline breach

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,280
or an employee possibly clicked on a

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
phishing email maybe they didn't update

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
the patches

96
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,599
that's more on the incident response for

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,040
the insider threat we're talking someone

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,360
just wrong maybe a snowden

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,120
oh maybe in ames maybe someone

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
like it pfizer that was working to leak

101
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
the data to

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
the chinese researchers that's been in

103
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
the news

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,920
and when we do penetration tests this

105
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,959
all ties into the

106
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,159
of insider threat to try to drive the

107
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
point home

108
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,640
a black box test they don't give us any

109
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,360
data just

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,959
go after the corporation here's the

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
scope

112
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,840
we're not going after aws we're not

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,040
going after azure

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
we're only going after this slice of the

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,160
network

116
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,720
a white box attack you get the

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,199
credentials you get log on validation

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,199
access to the facility you're inside the

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,960
network and then

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,199
if you've taken your assist book or your

121
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,320
certified

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
i can't talk this morning certified

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
ethical hacker

124
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,080
these are the more damaging penetration

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,360
tests because you have

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,600
access which is exactly what an insider

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,639
threat would have to

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
organization the most common

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
cause of a security incident is human

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,479
behavior

131
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,919
from that it could be someone picking up

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
the usb drive in the parking lot someone

133
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
who's been phished

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
someone who clicks on the wrong link

135
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
someone who wants to just

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
make things easier and share the files

137
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
at home where they log on to google chat

138
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,720
that's an entirely different piece of

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,199
threat where

140
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
if you log on to your google account on

141
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639
the corporate network all of your data

142
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
that you

143
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
work on is going to be retrieval through

144
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,080
google takeout so now if you leave the

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
corporation all that data is still

146
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,960
available to you

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,039
for nefarious purposes that would

148
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,400
possibly harm the organization

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
it only takes one inside threat actor to

150
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
lower the defenses here

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,440
from avengers in game we see nebula

152
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,759
2014 nebula in 2023

153
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,080
literally breaching the defense is

154
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,919
letting the adversary into the network

155
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,080
and we saw the second half of the movie

156
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
where because the defenses are ordered

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,960
from an insider threat

158
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,880
basically we have no more iron man we

159
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
have captain america gone back in time

160
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,919
we have a new captain

161
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,520
a lot of things changed because we had

162
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,080
an insider threat

163
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
so in the cia the traditional motives

164
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,199
for espionage

165
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,120
were mice you see the acronym money

166
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,759
ideology conscience

167
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,919
or ego we updated that to be compromised

168
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,600
or excitement some people just like the

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,080
thrill

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
of committing espionage and being cop

171
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,479
they need that ego boost

172
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,240
compromise could be something more like

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
blackmail pictures of

174
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
whatever event you did that you

175
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
shouldn't have someone's got on tape

176
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,039
they've got a tweet

177
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,639
they've got a video recording from your

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
ring doorbell if you don't do

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,039
x will release y to the media and

180
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,720
embarrass you and ruin your career

181
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
that's been the usual hallmark

182
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,840
in the early 2000s cia updated excuse me

183
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,800
the commercial motivations

184
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
that we've seen working inside a threat

185
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,080
money

186
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,840
ideology career

187
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,039
i'm unhappy at this corporation if i

188
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,479
take the data here

189
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,160
and move it to the next position i can

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,759
become a director working

191
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,240
over this and getting a large salary

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
increase having more power more prestige

193
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,479
and i'll show the previous employer that

194
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,000
i was worthy to have this previous

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
position external activities for insider

196
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
threat we're talking possible hacktivism

197
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,479
political means this corporation is

198
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:10,880
doing

199
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,199
x i don't agree with x i believe in why

200
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
i'm going to make sure that

201
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,759
the corporation sees why why is the

202
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,400
better option

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,759
the cia updated the mice acronym to

204
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,400
become

205
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,120
rascals reciprocity authority

206
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
scarcity commitment consistency career

207
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,680
some of the seeds remain the same

208
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,120
liking and social proof the authority

209
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
is well if you can you meet someone

210
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,120
overseas you chat them up as a case

211
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
officer

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,080
if you've really got the authority on

213
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,599
this department and you're really doing

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,560
this research

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
show me what you're working on that

216
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
you're so proud of because you want to

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,639
validate your authority or

218
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,720
conversely someone calls using voice

219
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
spoofing some of melissa miller's

220
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
deep fake technology that she spoke

221
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
about

222
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,400
the call appears coming from the ceo

223
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
and it says if you don't commit

224
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
to perform this wire transfer to this

225
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
non-standard account immediately your

226
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,639
courier's in trouble

227
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
it sounds like the ceo looks like the

228
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,000
ceo you can spoof a phone number

229
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,960
spoof card on your phone so now the

230
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,639
employee

231
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,199
has then

232
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
transferred millions of dollars to an

233
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,599
external account the wire transfer once

234
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,000
it's gone it's gone

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,799
you can't get the money back that would

236
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
be authority scarcity this is the last

237
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,240
opportunity there's only three seats

238
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,200

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,419

240
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,320
[Music]

241
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
this is a little bit more of a accurate

242
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,959
picture of why someone might commit

243
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,680
or be susceptible to social engineering

244
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,959
one of the things i know there's a

245
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,839
career track with kathleen

246
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
one of the things we thought at nato was

247
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
the social engineering as you come to

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,480
the end of your career

249
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
you go to linkedin you turn on the

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
beacon to say yes i'm interested in new

251
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
opportunities

252
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
recruiters come out of the world hey we

253
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,720
know you're happy down in san antonio

254
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,959
but we've got this six-month

255
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,920
no-benefit opportunity for you here in

256
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,880
ugadu

257
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,320
but you need to move immediately and

258
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,839
after the contract is over in six months

259
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,800
you have no job

260
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,959
we've all seen these weird offers but

261
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
for the social engineering piece

262
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,839
you go to this person doesn't exist dot

263
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,320
com you go to mail.com and create a

264
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,839
valid email address something

265
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
non-standard

266
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,680
and now you can become that corporation

267
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
i can say i work for apple i can say i

268
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
work for dell for hp

269
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
this person doesn't exist in a

270
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,519
non-standard recruiter.com style

271
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,200
email people were being approached by

272
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
foreign intelligence services for hey we

273
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
know you're leaving the service

274
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,560
what systems were you working on are you

275
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
familiar with what are the issues and as

276
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,399
they begin to build a report

277
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,480
through technical interviews there's the

278
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
elicitation of what have you really done

279
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
and you're unexpectedly giving away

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
classified intelligence

281
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
that you're not aware that you're

282
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
leaking out

283
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,440
the same thing could occur on the

284
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
insider threat of the social engineering

285
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,680
just like happened two days ago with

286
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
slacks and we came into the slack

287
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,240
channel

288
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
for ea which is kind of funny because

289
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,560
ea's always out for dlc packs for every

290
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
game you buy but that's my personal

291
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
commentary

292
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
this kind of straddles the line between

293
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,800
insider threat in

294
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
insight or incident response because

295
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,399
they came in through the network they

296
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,920
looked authoritative

297
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,519
and they convinced the help desk to

298
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
elevate privileges to gain access to the

299
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,519
system

300
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
it's still a modern method so we have

301
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,200
the human factor we saw that there's a

302
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
technical collection gap with the slack

303
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,800
channel

304
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,399
the gaps in coverage i'll touch on that

305
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,920
in a second the human factor

306
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
help desk wants to please people they

307
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,600
have metrics they have to meet

308
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
security sometimes becomes secondary

309
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,000
not to disparage close support

310
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
help desk there's a fine line between

311
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
helping individuals and people who

312
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
appear to be

313
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
authoritative so that's kind of stroud's

314
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
line yet again

315
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,839
the gaps in coverage we're talking about

316
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,120
things like on the apple network

317
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
if you log in with your apple id on a

318
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,760
corporate mac if they don't have the

319
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,560
proper

320
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,560
hardware installed for endpoint security

321
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,279
you can just go go to mail create a

322
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,640
draft put a sensitive document in there

323
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
and then when the network syncs now if

324
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,160
you look on your phone under draft on

325
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,800
your email

326
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,399
there's the document it wasn't a blocked

327
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,519
network

328
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,040
but it's still a channel that people use

329
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
to exfiltrate data from sensitive

330
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,079
corporate networks it's

331
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
a little bit tougher to block

332
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
the insider threat team is a little bit

333
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,880
different than dealing with the incident

334
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,120
response team we've got human resources

335
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,880
as a partner security and the legal

336
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
aspect legal because

337
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
what we're looking at is a possible

338
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,519
adverse action on someone's career

339
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,079
a resume generating event as they say

340
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,519
human resources has

341
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,200
data that needs to be shared with the

342
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,440
team and security because this is an

343
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,200
internal threat sometimes we do have the

344
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,560
physical threat

345
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
one client had a subcontractor

346
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,920
threatened to come in

347
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,519
with covet and cough on the team that

348
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
was working in the facility

349
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,000
they did it over corporate teams over

350
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,279
teams chat

351
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,279
i was able to go in with oath 365

352
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,639
compliance pull it back together with

353
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,079
magnet axiom

354
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,839
and put the pieces together he logged on

355
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,200
at home at this time

356
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,760
contacted these people hear the chat

357
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
messages hear the threats

358
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
and send the report off but we'll touch

359
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,719
as to what that means

360
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,279
the watch list the new hire yes it still

361
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,320
happens where you have corporate

362
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,120
espionage

363
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,600
a gets hired by b but they're still

364
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,760
employed by a to go in to see what

365
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
information you can glean about the

366
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,320
corporation

367
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
what are you looking for uh what new

368
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,399
phones is apple developing those type

369
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,120
things

370
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,639
if someone gives a two week notice it's

371
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
fairly common to be put on advanced

372
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,760
monitoring if you're going to leave

373
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,360
what data are they going to collect

374
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
before they leave are they going to turn

375
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
in their notice

376
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
and then burn two weeks of vacation are

377
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,440
they going to go in and harvest

378
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
files for exfiltration for the new

379
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
position

380
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,959
uh if you have a performance drop a

381
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,480
performance improvement plan which is

382
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
usually key for you're on the turkey

383
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
farm you're going to get let go at any

384
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
moment you just don't know it

385
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,079
what are they doing before they're being

386
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,120
asked to leave the network

387
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
uh level of access insider threat teams

388
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,760
of course with the level of access we

389
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
have

390
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
have a higher degree of scrutiny who

391
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,720
watches the watchers

392
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,480
the sock administrators the network

393
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,079
administrators they always get a little

394
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,959
bit

395
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,000
more scrutiny because of the level of

396
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
access they have lifestyle concerns

397
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,199
i'm picking on bottle up if bob shows up

398
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,959
if he's making 40 000 a year

399
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,040
as a new hire as an intern and he shows

400
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,000
up in a brand new

401
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,519
tesla with no other means of support

402
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,120
that's interesting how did he do that

403
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,639
did he win the lottery is he did he

404
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,320
strike it rich in dogecoin

405
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,000
or is there something else going on here

406
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
uh i'm in savannah right now there's a

407
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
large aerospace

408
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,399
manufacturer and they're well known

409
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,040
for constant layoffs every two to three

410
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,279
years for their technical community

411
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,800
so if you believe there's going to be a

412
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,480
layoff are people harvesting the files

413
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,320
to move to a competitor

414
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
our bonus is being slashed i eat

415
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,519
christmas vacation

416
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,040
are you in the jelly of the month club

417
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,639
instead of getting enough money to pay

418
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,560
for the in-ground pool

419
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
managed attrition if you believe you're

420
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,480
in the lower class of performers and

421
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,079
you're going to be let go what files are

422
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,360
you harvesting

423
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,240
to take with you for your new position

424
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,680
and if human resources

425
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
doesn't provide that basic excel file

426
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,760
that you can import into slack

427
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
just for the human watch list for

428
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
enhanced monitoring that's a

429
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
partnership that needs to be created

430
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,040
uh one thing coming out um a got nine

431
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,639
minutes left

432
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,399
one thing coming out of a certified

433
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,240
fraud examiner was a fraud triangle

434
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
rationalization

435
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,800
pressure and opportunity i'm going to be

436
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
let go

437
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
i've got the opportunity to get these

438
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,519
sensitive files and i can do i've worked

439
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,160
on this

440
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
i've got the reason i have it i deserve

441
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,519
to take this with me i deserve to get

442
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,399
wealthy off this

443
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,000
instead of leaving my work behind it's

444
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,360
very simple that people do this

445
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,639
psychologically when they're being let

446
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,079
go

447
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,920
now the watchlist sources repeated

448
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,199
access violations of

449
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,800
digital loss or data loss protection

450
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,959
did they try to insert usb drives are

451
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,079
they copying and pasting

452
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,000
sensitive data credit cards social

453
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,680
security numbers

454
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,440
are they asking for elevated access

455
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,519
through the help desk

456
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,959
previous employer with intelligence

457
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,399
community people kept asking for

458
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,000
restricted database access and they

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
didn't have rights that went to security

460
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,839
that wasn't just so you don't have

461
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,839
rights and no thank you

462
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,360
that was reason for concern that would

463
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
go on people's permanent records that

464
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,040
would

465
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,839
possibly trigger polygraphs repeated

466
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
access violations

467
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
you don't have access to plans and

468
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,360
intents for b-sides 2025 but you keep

469
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,959
trying to access this file

470
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,399
let's see what's going on with you

471
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
things such as you're trying to install

472
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,399
slack shadow programs dropbox

473
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,519
things beyond the corporate scope

474
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,279
and one thing in red here is the need to

475
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,199
know yes bob needs to know this for his

476
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,000
job versus

477
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
need to know yeah that would be neat to

478
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
know the plans and intents for the next

479
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,920
five years

480
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,199
but you don't need to do that to the

481
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,360
scope of your program for security

482
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
data exfiltration if you picture a

483
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,120
toddler squeezing plato is about the

484
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,959
best analogy there wasn't really a good

485
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,240
gift of that on

486
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
google you can only get the data out so

487
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
many ways whether it's a usb

488
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
sd card people block usbs but they

489
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,839
forget to block the sd card ports

490
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
the bluetooth file sharing capability on

491
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,399
some of the macs

492
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,320
corporate email leak is the number one

493
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,079
way data is removed

494
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,000
from the network and put to a private

495
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,079
hands that part shouldn't go

496
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,079
in printing we're not talking so much

497
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,439
print to pdf and

498
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,839
save on onedrive but actually printing

499
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,839
the files at home

500
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,839
the chat and shadow it whether it's

501
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,959
slack

502
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,959
blue jeans zoom the plethora of online

503
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,400
services that are out there to share

504
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,880
data

505
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,439
that we've all encountered the past year

506
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,119
are they installing these files on their

507
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,960
corporate machines and they shouldn't

508
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
the sync services whether it's google

509
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,320
takeout

510
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,360
the apple file system where you can go

511
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,760
to

512
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
data i think it's retrieve my data

513
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
apple.com something like that

514
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,919
but you can get the copy of everything

515
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,760
all of your text messages photos call

516
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
logs from apple just like you can google

517
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,240
so the sensitive document that you sent

518
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,559
over imessage is still retrievable

519
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,320
is that something your corporation is

520
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,840
permitting

521
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
and in the cloud storage one great thing

522
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
chris vance brought up last week at

523
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,960
techno forensic in myrtle beach

524
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,679
are the logs monitored that's something

525
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,200
we can't pull into axiom to see if

526
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
they're uploading data

527
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,919
briefly touch on the accidental data

528
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
exfiltration

529
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
facebook messenger at one point

530
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
harvested all the text messages that

531
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,960
were on a corporate phone

532
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
so in addition to your facebook message

533
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,880
accounts it was everything corporately

534
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,720
related we had people in the service who

535
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,760
wanted to use that

536
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,360
for coordinating a rival departure of

537
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,280
their units we explain from a security

538
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,039
aspect that this is now going to

539
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,320
facebook for marketing it's there

540
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
forever we don't need troop movements

541
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
coordinated through facebook policy

542
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
change but this is still something that

543
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,440
can be a risky organization

544
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
in the home stretcher the log on warning

545
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,520
is real you do consent to monitoring

546
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
when you log on most corporate networks

547
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,640
and here's what i mean

548
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
with splunk i can get network data

549
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
traffic log on times badge access

550
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,720
when you went to lunch when you logged

551
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,799
in and out of skiff when you came

552
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,760
left from the facility are you arriving

553
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,280
at a party at odd times

554
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,440
the office in chat content as well as

555
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,679
the documents created in o365 as well as

556
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,799
all the versions

557
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,120
did you rename sensitive file.txt to

558
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,679
bob's resume.txt

559
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,600
remote file access with gruba if that's

560
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,960
installed as an endpoint

561
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,720
i can connect remotely just pull your

562
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
registry we'll run that through axiom to

563
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,559
see what the last files you

564
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
examined were

565
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,440
the tools to see what an individual has

566
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160
been up to

567
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,520
versus the entirety of a dead box

568
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,880
forensic case

569
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,760
smaller lighter faster so we can move on

570
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,600
to a false positive this person really

571
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,080
isn't

572
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,679
doing anything that fairs it's a false

573
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,559
positive yes they move files in bulk

574
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,799
but we told them to you're moving from

575
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,320
this division to that division

576
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
move the files with you no harm no foul

577
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,480
lastly mcafee when enabled properly you

578
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
can see it

579
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
when the usb drive was inserted what

580
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,919
files were moved there what was printed

581
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,360
what was copied and pasted to the

582
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,200
clipboard

583
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,280
whether it's allowed or denied that

584
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,600
still recorded for perpetuity and to

585
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,440
get the better picture of what the actor

586
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
has been doing

587
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,880
i mentioned magnet axiom we had one case

588
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
a million files plus when we did the

589
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,480
full forensic collection

590
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
but there was only one excel document

591
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,720
for someone who didn't do that

592
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,480
they didn't use excel from their group

593
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,880
lucky guy

594
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
we can see the uploads to aws we can see

595
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,640
the presence of

596
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
shadow i.t do they have slack installed

597
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,679
and files

598
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,200
are on chat slack

599
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,880
one thing to consider might be the use

600
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
of a honey file here we've got

601
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
super interesting company file that no

602
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
one to touch except the internal threat

603
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
team

604
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,320
knowing this is something that's let's

605
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
see who actually goes out and collects

606
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,799
it

607
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,320
much like a honeypot for network

608
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,320
intrusion same principle applies here

609
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,159
another thing to throw out is can versus

610
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,919
should just because you can provide

611
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,240
someone a detailed user data for every

612
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,280
action on the network

613
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,120
should you if

614
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,240
bob in it wants to see what mary in

615
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
accounting is doing the app that has

616
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,039
access is there written documentation is

617
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,400
just just someone who's

618
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,520
curious about it for whatever reason and

619
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,159
if you're

620
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
uncomfortable push back in writing go to

621
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
supervisors go to leadership

622
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,600
get concurrence before you accidentally

623
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,480
breach someone's privacy

624
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,600
the risk mitigation principles

625
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
control the access there's separation of

626
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,679
roles and there's a need to know

627
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,440
document everything i've got to get this

628
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
to a wrapped up point here

629
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,520
develop an sop for sensitive files a

630
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
child pornography if you run across that

631
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,880
what are you going to do with it before

632
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,640
you touch it

633
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
if it's not written down and documented

634
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,559
it didn't occur

635
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,000
two is one one it's not that's just a

636
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,640
fun saying now the system worked

637
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
we found somebody there's an incident

638
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
we're going to have a meeting who's the

639
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
imposter

640
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
three-person rule again we're on a time

641
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
crunch here i'm used to a full hour

642
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,640
25 minutes is good before

643
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,720
you go to leadership and management with

644
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,799
we found this incident

645
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,880
have two other people verify the finding

646
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,960
to say yes this looks suspicious

647
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,880
okay did we think about this that or the

648
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,000
other because if you go

649
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,320
forward and say we believe bob is

650
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,760
committing

651
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,280
actions that look like insider threat

652
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,520
that could damage his career

653
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,600
verify it when you have it verified we

654
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,480
go to leadership with the report

655
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
be prepared because the world is great

656
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,799
just like robert ritter

657
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,480
from clear and present danger the

658
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
managers might say well yes they did

659
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,120
that but

660
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,799
you know it's not really a big deal

661
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,320
versus

662
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,679
give us all your notes cease

663
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,760
investigation we're going to prosecute

664
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,080
the

665
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,000
individual we're going to terminate them

666
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
it can go

667
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919
in a variety of directions but be

668
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:56,960
prepared for the

669
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,480
well it's not really that big of a deal

670
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
even though it hits all the hallmarks of

671
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,080
insider threat and data exfiltration

672
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,840
because the sea level executive they may

673
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,679
not know it's a big deal

674
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,280
that does happen and it was a little

675
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,880
surprising on the private side to have

676
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,840
that type of

677
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,360
letdown for oh if you get paid that much

678
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,600
money you can take the data

679
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,200
last thought here as we're coming up on

680
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
time

681
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,880
the intelligence community has maximum

682
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
tour lengths for

683

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
sensitive materials for your own mental

685
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,080
health

686
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,159
if you're performing a role like this

687
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,520
rotate out every so often

688
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
every year two years do something

689
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520

690
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,919

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,559
department

694
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,760

695
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,039
yourself you can't take care of other

696
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,799
people

697
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,720

698
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,080
