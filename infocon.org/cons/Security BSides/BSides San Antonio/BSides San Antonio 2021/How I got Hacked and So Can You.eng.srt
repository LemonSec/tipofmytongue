abundance

52
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,280
um and just to sort of give you some

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,759
perspective so the first hack that i

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,360
ever pulled off so sound like i've been

55
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,520
doing it i guess i'm showing my age

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
was on a machine sort of like what you

57
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,880
see pictured there

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
and it was angelo state university this

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,479
is before it was illegal by the way i

60
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,079
should make that disclaimer

61
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,240
um and so because they had a really

62
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,079
awesome star trek game

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
uh that i was just dying to pay uh on

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
their mainframe

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,399
and so that was my introduction into

66
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,319
hacking and computer security

67
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,920
a long time ago so uh during this talk

68
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,560
we're going to

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
kind of go through an overview of how my

70
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,560
own social media account

71
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,319
was hacked we're going to talk about

72
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,319
some motivations of attackers

73
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,520
uh talk about some of the law

74
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239
enforcement uh tools that we use

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,800
um and methodologies to to conduct

76
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
investigations

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
uh we'll talk some about some

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
investigation challenges for

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
both law enforcement and for

80
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,760
corporations and for private individuals

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,599
uh we'll go through some of the findings

82
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,040
so how we

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
what we gathered up at the end of that

84
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
investigation

85
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,920
and then finish off with some lessons

86
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,599
learned hopefully all within 45 minutes

87
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,800
that is our prescribed timeline and then

88
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
maybe some questions so

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
september 9th uh 2020 i'm having my

90
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,959
morning coffee checking my email and i

91
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,159
see a

92
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,440
an email from facebook at 3

93
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,200
25 in the morning and it says hey

94
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,400
there was a recent login from

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
this ip address in san antonio but at 3

96
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,440
25 in the morning being an investigator

97
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
being a professor of cyber security i

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
was pretty sure that wasn't me

99
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
um but i thought hey this could be some

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,360
kind of good looking fishing

101
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,920
uh nothing to see here scroll on keep

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,680
looking at some messages

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
and then i find a second one dated same

104
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,519
date

105
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,080
but about four minutes later a password

106
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,480
change was initiated

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,920
same ip address as it designated a san

108
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,640
antonio so geo located in san antonio

109
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,040
um and then some great advice from

110
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,080
facebook saying

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,319
if you didn't do this please secure your

112
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
account and so luckily i had

113
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,360
set up um challenges and

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
two-factor authentication some other

115
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,959
things in my account and i was able

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,040
after several hours to secure my account

117
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,799
looking through didn't see anything had

118
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,400
changed

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,799
but i started thinking how could this

120
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,000
happen to me

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,079
right i investigate cyber crime i've

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,759
been doing this a long time i teach

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,880
cyber security

124
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
um and i have pretty good habits right i

125
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
use complex passwords

126
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
so brute forcing no i don't think that's

127
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,440
how they manage to do it

128
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
i don't reuse passwords across sites so

129
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,759
it doesn't matter if if my email or or a

130
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,520
previous password was uncovered or

131
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
leaked in a breach

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,400
that's not the issue i'm pretty good at

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,280
spotting

134
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,680
phishing emails right so i get them all

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
the time hey here's one from geek squad

136
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
dash accounts dot ga

137
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,680
okay nope not falling for your phishing

138
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,759
email um here's another oh

139
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
here's your invoice right and then the

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
invoice is a

141
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
number dot zip file and some uh no

142
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
those are pretty obvious i must say i

143
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,680
was a little

144
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,639
um it was a challenging one for me

145
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,759
yesterday when

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,479
the reverend riley told me that he was

147
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,199
gonna give me

148
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
5.4 million dollars yesterday but i

149
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
managed not to click on any links in

150
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,160
that one as well

151
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
um or smishing right so sending text

152
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,919
messages

153
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,919
same thing uh now i'm not clicking on

154
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,199
your link so

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,880
that's not how it so as i dug in more

156
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
and started thinking how did this happen

157
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,840
where did this come from i trace it back

158
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,479
to an

159
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,160
old email so the first time i retired

160
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,960
um i was highly involved in mixed

161
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
martial arts and started a company

162
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
called texas amateur mixed martial arts

163
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
association

164
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,199
and so we did fights all over the state

165
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
of texas in mexico

166
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,840
a couple of other countries other states

167
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
adopted our rule set

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,639
but all of that was associated with the

169
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,520
domain

170
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,600
texasfighter.org and my email account

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,319
at the time was president texas

172
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,199
fighter.org

173
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,560
2010-ish 2011 i got

174
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
out of that business and i passed that

175
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,440
along and i passed along that domain

176
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,039
to another entity obviously they didn't

177
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,720
continue to use it and they allowed the

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,560
domain to lapse

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,919
and so someone registered that domain

180
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,319
the day before so september the 8th so

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,280
the day before

182
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,039
my facebook password changes um

183
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,039
someone registers this domain and they

184
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,360
stand up a mail server

185
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
for the sole purpose of having access to

186
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,919
that email

187
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,199
president at texasfighter.org so

188
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,600
at this point it's pretty obvious that

189
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
someone specifically targeted me

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
specifically targeted my account and

191
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
here's how they were

192
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,440
initiated the password change by the way

193
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
facebook doesn't ever

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
forget anything we'll talk about that

195
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,280
more as we kind of go through this

196
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
so after i've secured my account and

197
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
after i figure out this is how it

198
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,360
happened

199
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
well now i want what's the motivation

200
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,720
behind this why me

201
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,039
and i think is this like revenge it

202
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:09,919
could be

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
um i've been the last couple years i've

204
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
concentrated on building the

205
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,759
the cyber defense program for the

206
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,680
college but uh

207
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
prior to that i mean i've i've seized

208
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,199
hundreds of thousands of dollars i've

209
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,039
i've seized bitcoin wallets from bad

210
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,000
boys so

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,880
maybe one of them has a beef and says

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,000
you know what i'm going to get back at

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,599
this guy because she cost me a lot of

214
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,000
money

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,479
i can see that in the

216
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,280
law enforcement we we place a lot of

217
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,199
emphasis on the motivations of an

218
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,319
attacker

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,800
and so since we're extra clever in law

220
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
enforcement we we came

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
up with the acronym of mice right lots

222
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
of lots of

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
mouses since it's computer oriented not

224
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,360
mises

225
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
and so we say that there are four

226
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
primary motivations for an attacker

227
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,599
the first one being money uh the second

228
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,960
one ideology

229
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,319
right so hacktivism uh compromise either

230
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,680
compromise that person

231
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
or further compromise uh an entity

232
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
further compromise an organization

233
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,720
or use it as a staging site to

234
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,840
compromise other

235
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,879
entities or ego and so that's kind of

236
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,000
associated with the

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
old school uh kind of that hacking

238
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
mentality that we all kind of have i say

239
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
i just want to kind of see if i can do

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,960
this

241
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
sometimes people go a little further

242
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,160
than they should legally

243
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,800
and so that'll get him into trouble so

244
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
ego being probably the the lowest

245
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,399
risk but still i'm thinking you know

246
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,039
what um for me

247
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,719
i'm still thinking this is some kind of

248
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,200
revenge right they didn't post anything

249
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,000
didn't have time to

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
do that and that brings us to our first

251
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,360
challenge of investigation so

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,120
why even bother reporting something like

253
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
this right so someone tried to take over

254
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,399
my account

255
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,640
i secured it i figured out how they did

256
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,279
it i made sure it couldn't happen again

257
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,519
no harm no foul um the problem is

258
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,640
is that law enforcement and other

259
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,120
entities that do investigations

260
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,120
we need data to to to determine what the

261
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,000
emerging trends are for types of attacks

262
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,279
and so we used to say that about 20

263
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,040
of crimes are actually reported

264
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,920
and in the cyber world in cyber fraud

265
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
we're we're thinking that might be

266
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
down around one of ten so only ten

267
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
percent of crimes are reported so that

268
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,959
means

269
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,720
for every one crime reported there's

270
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,880
nine others that are out there

271
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
and that data's not getting put into any

272
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
sort of

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,360
um pool for us to see these emerging

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
trends

275
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
so for me personally i thought hey this

276
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
is a good it'll be a good challenge i

277
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,880
teach a forensics course

278
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,240
at lakeview and we'll just use it as

279
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
part of

280
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,240
uh we'll use this real investigation as

281
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
part of

282
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,240
our curriculum in the class we'll step

283
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,640
through it with our with our students

284
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
so we like to think that law enforcement

285
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
um that this is our current state right

286
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,000
so that we're

287
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
uh it's penelope garcia or i have issued

288
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
so there and

289
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
everything's high tech and we've got all

290
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,040
these computer screens around us and we

291
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,640
have all these awesome tools

292
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,680
um and the reality is we're probably

293
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,399
closer

294
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,800
to these guys right uh adam12 and

295
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,440
and dragnet if anybody's even old enough

296
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
to remember those

297
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
so a lot of what we do in investigations

298
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
is we kind of have to start off a little

299
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
bit old school and we do that with open

300
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
source

301
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,720
intelligence and a lot of non-tech tools

302
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
before we get to use our cool spiffy

303
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,399
analysis computer tools

304
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,480
so using open source intelligence

305
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
i can look at that ip address right that

306
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,120
104 ip address that was used to log in

307
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,920
it's geolocating back to san antonio so

308
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,320
it's

309
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,399
bypassing some of the fencing that

310
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,000
facebook

311
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
has in place to prevent unauthorized

312
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
password changes to an account

313
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,920
so good for them um

314
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,279
as a private person that's about all you

315
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,000
can get

316
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,920
is okay um who owns that and and where

317
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,959
does that ip

318
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,079
come from so as law enforcement we have

319
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,040
a few more

320
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,800
tools in our arsenal if you will and so

321
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,720
the first one being subpoenas

322
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
uh there's civil subpoenas there's

323
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
administrative subpoenas

324
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,720
um both of those are

325
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,399
somewhat useful but big companies

326
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,560
you figure they're getting a lot of

327
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
requests for data and requests for

328
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
information

329
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,320
and so they don't really respond

330
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,680
um enthusiastically

331
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,839
to civil subpoenas or to administrative

332
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,079
subpoenas but a grand jury subpoena

333
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,600
that's kind of different right so grand

334
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
jury

335
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,959
familiar with that grand jury is

336
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,160
something that was established in the

337
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,040
constitution

338
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,480
and a grand jury's job is to investigate

339
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
crimes or to help investigate crimes

340
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,839
that may or may not have been committed

341
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,200
within their county

342
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,880
so in san antonio that would be bear

343
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,040
county so the bexar county grand jury

344
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,200
has the ability to issue subpoenas and

345
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
say we want this document from your

346
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
company

347
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,440
that is legally binding in every state

348
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,120
in the united states so most companies

349
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
do a good job of responding to a grand

350
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,959
jury subpoena

351
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,880
there's also court orders that

352
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,680
investigators can apply for

353
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
those are pretty limited in scope you

354
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,839
don't run across them too much

355
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,519
sometimes when seizing bank accounts you

356
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,360
might use court orders but

357
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
for the most part we rely on search

358
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
warrants if i need actual data

359
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,760
or to seize physically some bit of

360
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,639
evidence

361
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,120
so there's federal search warrants so i

362
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
think fbi doj

363
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,720
they're a little bit harder to get

364
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
the assistant

365
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,519
district attorneys and and the ausa's

366
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,040
they kind of like to write their search

367
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,639
warrants by committee and it might take

368
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,000
two or three days

369
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
to get a search warrant done through the

370
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
federal system

371
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
but state district courts any

372
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
peace officer can write a search warrant

373
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,399
go in stand in front of a judge

374
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,839
who's presiding in the court and say hey

375
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,440
i have a search warrant and i need to

376
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,000
get this

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
this information i need to get this

378
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,040
evidence and i think it's

379
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,079
hidden here or it's located here

380
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,600
will you grant me permission to go get

381
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,000
it if the state judge says yep

382
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,399
i agree that's legit they sign off on it

383
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,440
and away you go and

384
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,959
and you can get a lot more data with a

385
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,720
search warrant as opposed to a subpoena

386
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,839
so we start an investigation

387
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,800
open up an actual criminal case i run a

388
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,560
whois on that

389
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,920
address everyone has access to this

390
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,240
and it's microsoft right so this is a

391
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,399
microsoft azure

392
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,199
account a machine that was located

393
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
in the san antonio office in the san

394
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
antonio data center

395
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,760
that was used to initiate the password

396
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,519
change that was used

397
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,760
to prompt the initial login so

398
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,880
i want to find out who has that account

399
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
right so who owns this account

400
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,199
um and what ip address are they logging

401
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:23,920
into

402
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,000
this is your account from so they're

403
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,720
using virtual machines

404
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
okay pretty common to do that but where

405
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
did where did that originate from and so

406
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
in order to see that

407
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
i need a grand jury subpoena get one

408
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,920
signed

409
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,560
send it off to both microsoft and my

410
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,600
registrar

411
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,399
if you caught that on the last slide um

412
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,000
was wild west domains

413
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,639
they're a subsidiary of godaddy and so

414
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,839
also sent a

415
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,000
subpoena off to godaddy to say hey who

416
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,160
registered this

417
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,000
texasfighter.org this person

418
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,279
is obviously up to no good i want to try

419
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,399
and find out who it was

420
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
so whole purpose of our investigation so

421
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,560
then the waiting game happens right so

422
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
you send off your subpoena and although

423
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,800
they're required to respond within 14

424
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,560
days that typically doesn't happen on

425
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,240
most big

426
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,399
companies but about a week later i get

427
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,040
a notification on my phone that hey

428
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,320
paypal

429
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,880
just try to hit your bank account for

430
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
ten dollars and then six hundred dollars

431
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,720
um for facebook advertising and i'm

432
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,639
kind of shocked by that i'm like hey

433
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,120
wait i'm not running facebook ads

434
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,759
i haven't run facebook ads since 2010

435
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,639
back when i was

436
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,720
in the fight game and promoting events

437
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,160
so

438
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,839
this is is this a smishing attempt that

439
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,720
looks good right

440
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
somebody is somebody trying to compete

441
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
or is it legit and so i log into my

442
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
facebook

443
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,000
and facebook says no there are no ad

444
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,720
accounts

445
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,759
uh associated with you um there are no

446
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,800
payment methods

447
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,839
associated with you an amount spent zero

448
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,240
dollars

449
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,720
but i log into paypal and paypal says

450
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
nope

451
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,040
facebook absolutely sent this

452
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,600
request over for money i disputed and

453
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,519
say this is obviously fraudulent and

454
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,079
pace

455
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,680
paypal says nope uh it's a legitimate

456
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
charge because you've done this before

457
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,639
in the past

458
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,839
12 years ago so

459
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,560
a multitude of issues there thinking

460
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,120
really

461
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,440
12 years later an account suddenly

462
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,199
becomes active nobody

463
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,240
doesn't trip anyone's threshold for

464
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,399
problems and when i reported his fraud

465
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,240
you're going to argue with me and say no

466
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,360
it's legitimate

467
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,320
um that's a whole different conversation

468
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,880
there with

469
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
with the way paypal handles but then i

470
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,279
start thinking okay paypal is associated

471
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,199
with my bank

472
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
maybe i should contact my bank and make

473
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,319
sure there's no debits going on and

474
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,039
hooray for local banks so i call my

475
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,480
local bank and i'm on the phone with

476
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,319
them they're very helpful

477
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
as most banks or credit card companies

478
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
are if you've ever had to deal with with

479
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,079
a fraudulent purchase

480
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,679
they kind of take the statement and i'm

481
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,880
on the phone and i'm talking to them it

482
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
says no your bank accounts are fine no

483
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,359
one's trying to

484
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,079
um no one's trying to access them

485
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,599
there's nothing here but just to be safe

486
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
we'll reissue you new cards

487
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,799
okay great idea um and then

488
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,080
the representative says let's look at

489
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,240
your credit card banking

490
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
so i have a business credit card that's

491
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,520
associated with the

492
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
company let's look at that just to see

493
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,559
what's happening

494
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,679
and while we're talking on the phone

495
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,679
the representative says holy cow i've

496
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
never seen anything like this before i'm

497
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
watching this in real time

498
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,559
and so it starts off 35 35 35

499
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,400
50 50 250 then 300 then 600 and then 900

500
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,960
900

501
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,760
900 every few seconds facebook

502
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,520
advertising is trying to

503
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
charge my business credit card um

504
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
thankfully local bank again says obvious

505
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
is fraudulent

506
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
he was excited because he had never seen

507
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,640
anything like that before

508
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,840
he was like wow i've never seen this

509
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,400
happen real time i'm like well i'm glad

510
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,039
that i

511
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,120
got to get you some excitement in your

512
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,360
life for me it's more of an irritation

513
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,919
but still thankfully i'm not out any

514
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,559
money because i've stopped it

515
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
this is investigation challenge number

516
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,400
two so for law enforcement

517
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
who becomes the victim i'm not really a

518
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,480
victim anymore i didn't lose money

519
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,720
my bank didn't lose money they didn't

520
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
have to reimburse they just blocked all

521
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,360
of the charges

522
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,880
and so technically speaking facebook is

523
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,320
the only victim here

524
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,600
right they're the ones running

525
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
advertising and they're not getting the

526
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,720
money for it

527
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,320
um facebook probably is not going to

528
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
call back to chip thorns over and say

529
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,520
hey can you investigate this further we

530
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,280
want to try and figure out who did this

531
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,640
right big company who knows how much

532
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
fraudulent advertising is run uh on any

533
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,600
given day for them so

534
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
it's a challenge as far as who is the

535
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,280
victim and then you go back into that

536
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
well why is someone going to bother

537
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,720
investigating if we can't even

538
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,440
determine who the victim really is in

539
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,320
this case

540
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
so as i'm pondering all of these things

541
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,600
a month or so later microsoft responds

542
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,720
and they have this really cool and and

543
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,760
most

544
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,000
companies do actually so they have an

545
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
online portal for law enforcement use so

546
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
you can submit your search warrants and

547
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,760
submit subpoenas

548
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,039
and it's all kind of an automated

549
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,280
process and then they respond

550
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
through their automated process and so

551
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,799
um

552
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,480
oddly the microsoft

553
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,440
portal has issues if you have an

554
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,320
existing

555
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,559
outlook account it can't differentiate

556
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,679
and so they recommend in their

557
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,559
documentation

558
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,000
that you just make up a fake microsoft

559
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,679
outlook account in order to get

560
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,200
the return for your legal process which

561
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,880
is odd to me um

562
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,000
it seems like they could figure out

563
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
maybe a better way and maybe use your

564
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,440
law enforcement email like other

565
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,799
companies do but

566
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
it's microsoft and and they do what

567
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,080
microsoft does

568
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,000
but i finally get signed in with some

569
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,280
help with them and i look

570
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,760
and the response is sorry we have no

571
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,080
records we can't tell you

572
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
who logged into that ip address who

573
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,679
owned that account

574
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,159
we have no records for that particular

575
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,559
time which

576
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,240
okay it could happen but

577
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,320
again i'm a fairly bright guy and i know

578
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
how computers work and there should be

579
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,559
logs of people making connections and

580
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,320
there should be logs of who's using an

581
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,080
ip address during a certain time

582
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,919
it's not that rural shouldn't be that

583
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,760
challenging for microsoft to provide

584
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,720
this information

585
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
but for whatever reason they were unable

586
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,000
to do that

587
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,600
so challenge number three during an

588
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,480
investigation

589
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,200
lack of compliance so law enforcement

590
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,799
relies upon

591
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,400
companies corporations right to respond

592
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,960
to

593
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,120
our subpoenas to respond to a search

594
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
warrant to give that information back so

595
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,840
we can continue an

596
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,640
investigation a lot of times

597
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,799
companies are not compliant and it's not

598
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
that they're

599
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,760
maliciously not complying there's a lot

600
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,080
of

601
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
issues with overlapping laws between

602
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,679
federal laws and state laws and

603
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,080
different

604
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
states have different laws providing

605
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,919
user privacy so

606
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,520
if you're out in california which

607
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
microsoft is

608
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,679
and some of the other big tech companies

609
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,280
microsoft and that ninth circuit

610
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,240
companies have been sued for violating a

611
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,679
user's privacy

612
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,120
by responding to grand jury subpoenas by

613
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,799
responding to law enforcement search

614
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,679
warrants

615
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,400
um they've been sued and obviously sued

616
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,360
enough to where

617
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,679
they're very aware of that and and so

618
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,480
they

619
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,559
almost take the side of the bad guy and

620
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,760
so you send a

621
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,919
uh you send a subpoena you send a search

622
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,200
warrant they contact

623
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
many times they'll contact the user and

624
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,559
say

625
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,679
hey we have this legal document they

626
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,880
want your information

627
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,159
is it okay if we give it to them um

628
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,760
i'm going to guess most bad guys

629
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
probably say

630
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,799
no we'd rather you're not but

631
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,440
whatever right it's just it's just it's

632
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,799
just a challenge

633
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,600
um and then there's the lag time so a

634
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
grand jury subpoena says you have 14

635
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,200
days we need this information

636
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,880
microsoft responds within a month or so

637
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,320
right and say hey sorry we don't have

638
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,880
any records i'm still waiting for

639
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,559
godaddy's response

640
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,640
i still don't know how that domain was

641
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,880
registered was it used

642
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,799
um did they domain kite could be

643
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,400
was it a stolen credit card that was

644
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
used to pay for it who knows

645
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
at some point hopefully they'll respond

646
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,559
and i'll have an answer to that question

647
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,240
so i'm thinking i am sunk in my

648
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,440
investigation and that's a little

649
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,799
depressing since we're going through

650
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,320
this in a class

651
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,799
and and we're teaching it so but good

652
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,960
things come to those who wait so as i'm

653
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,919
waiting

654
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,159
we come into the new year it's 2021 yay

655
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,400
2020 is over with

656
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,000
and then it i get a

657
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
report from an individual that

658
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,720
their facebook has been hacked and the

659
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,679
reason that they're

660
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,159
actually contacting late law enforcement

661
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,120
over this

662
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,159
they're a politician they're an elected

663
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:36,799
official

664
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,600
and their facebook was hacked and they

665
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,039
are dead certain

666
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,400
that it is their opponent

667
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
right my opponent i just know that my

668
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,760
opponent has

669
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,200
either done it themselves or they've

670
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,559
hacked my facebook and it's all to

671
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,520
prevent me

672
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
right from from being effective because

673
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,279
an election is coming up in just a few

674
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,159
weeks

675
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,320
um and of course i counsel them and say

676
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,679
wait slow your roll

677
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,240
um and share with them a little bit of i

678
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,080
was certain that this was revenge

679
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
and then weird things are happening with

680
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,600
facebook ads and so double check your

681
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,000
account

682
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
make sure you don't have any of those

683
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
things um

684
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,520
sort of lingering in the background they

685
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,400
assured me no

686
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,840
no that's not an issue they've never

687
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,000
done facebook ads okay good for you

688
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,240
um facebook provides the ip address that

689
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
we use to log

690
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,240
in and so i've redacted this one for

691
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,080
well i'll tell you why in a little bit

692
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,919
um so it's a local

693
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,679
not a local but it's it's in the united

694
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
states address

695
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
based out of california so this is a

696
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,480
california server

697
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
california virtual machine and it's

698
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
hosted by a cloud provider

699
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,039
so what a smaller one this isn't a

700
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,640
microsoft azure account

701
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,120
this is a smaller company and so i

702
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
contact them

703
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
say hey here is a grand jury subpoena i

704
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,720
need information on this account

705
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,000
and within a day they respond

706
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
which is why i redacted their name

707
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,279
because i don't want to burn them they

708
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,000
actually

709
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,200
did really great compliance um all

710
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,880
of their login ips were from

711
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,760
vietnam or vietnamese internet providers

712
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,240
the address given for the owner of the

713
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,360
account and a name

714
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,120
was a vietnam address the most important

715
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,760
thing

716
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,240
from my standpoint the virtual machine

717
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,679
that was used

718
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
to compromise this politician's account

719
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,320
it's still up and running with a

720
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,559
subpoena i can get

721
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,679
account details like these but

722
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,360
now i want a copy of that i want to copy

723
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
the virtual machine i want to see what

724
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,039
tools they're running i want to see

725
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,640
what kind of malware they might be right

726
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
i want to see how are they compromising

727
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,279
these accounts

728
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,840
i'm pretty sure i understand why right

729
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,760
they're somehow making money

730
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,400
um using facebook advertising haven't

731
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,919
quite figured all that out yet but

732
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,159
they're definitely trying to monetize

733
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,080
compromising someone's social media

734
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,120
account

735
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
so investigation challenge number four

736
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,679
for law enforcement

737
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,760
getting a hold of cloud data requires

738
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,679
the help of that provider's i.t

739
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,039
staff we can't roll down to a local

740
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,440
data center and say hey i'm here and i'd

741
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,600
like to image one of your servers

742
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,400
in this huge array right we have no idea

743
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,120
where it's

744
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,039
physically located there's just no it's

745
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,440
just not going to happen

746
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,559
but the data provided the cloud provider

747
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,279
has i t staff they can narrow it down

748
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,720
they could make

749
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,799
a copy of this right they can create a

750
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,640
snapshot image or

751
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,679
create a forensics image you

752
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,799
are reliant upon their

753
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,520
good graces their goodwill as to how

754
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,720
quickly they might do it

755
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,679
or or whether or not they'll do a full

756
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,080
job

757
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,120
for you um in this particular case they

758
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,640
did a great job

759
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,919
and it was pretty quick so 57 gigabytes

760
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,679
of encrypted data later

761
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,640
um i now have an image of this virtual

762
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,279
server

763
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,320
that was used to compromise this

764
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,039
politician's facebook account

765
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,400
so i mount my image

766
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,360
ftk imager i use autopsy right so

767
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,240
nothing wrong with

768
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,360
free with open source software when

769
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,080
you're conducting

770
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,320
investigation just like you can use open

771
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,919
source intelligence using open source

772
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,039
software

773
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,919
is just as valid it's all about our

774
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,760
methodology and how we document what

775
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,559
we've done

776
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,080
so one of the first things that catches

777
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,880
my eye hey look there are 11 different

778
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,919
accounts with logins that were created

779
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,279
using this machine

780
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,200
10 of them are facebook the 11th

781
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,760
is for an app called zala which is a

782
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,120
vietnamese

783
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,679
anonymizing chat right so it allows you

784
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,200
to to send

785
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,399
smishing right to send text messages um

786
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,840
over or out to uh phone so

787
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,200
okay that's pretty encouraging lots of

788
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
information

789
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,559
and the web cookies lots of form

790
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,440
autofills

791
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,240
lots of web history in there it's a lot

792
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
of information on this system

793
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,679
and it took several days of looking at

794
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,279
it to really go through it

795
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,679
so interesting things there were only

796
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,960
three bookmarks

797
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
that he had so this person has a

798
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,080
bookmark

799
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,159
set up in their browser for facebook

800
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,279
advertising

801
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,440
right for the ad payment inquiry hey i'm

802
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,120
having a problem i have questions about

803
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,559
my payments so

804
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,720
um apparently their

805
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,440
payment hit problems happen when you

806
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,679
hack someone's facebook account and

807
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,720
you're using your billing advertising

808
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,480
campaigns them fraudulently apparently

809
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
it requires a lot of help so

810
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,120
that was pretty interesting

811
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
a few user accounts so as i look through

812
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
the user accounts on the machine itself

813
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
there's really only one

814
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,039
so there's one active user account and

815
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,200
it's

816
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
i butchered that if someone has a better

817
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,279
grasp

818
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,240
of vietnamese i apologize for that so

819
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
there's one single user who's been using

820
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,840
this machine who's logging

821
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,080
into and out of that machine and i

822
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,279
already established that

823
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,159
it's from vietnamese uh internet

824
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,720
provider so it's actually out of hanoi

825
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,120
is where these the law all of the logins

826
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,200
into this machine are coming from

827
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,320
so other notable artifacts

828
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,000
um there were a total of 4079 email

829
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,320
addresses

830
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,600
most of them were not part of uh data

831
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,440
dumps we're not part of breach dumps

832
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,080
so if you're not familiar with have i

833
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,960
been pwned

834
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,640
you can put in an email address it'll

835
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,200
show you all of the associated

836
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,240
data breaches that that email has been

837
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,679
compromised in or potentially

838
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,120
compromised in the majority of these

839
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,760
4079 emails

840
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,640
were not found in existing dumps so this

841
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,720
was fresh ground

842
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,840
he's not relying upon uh

843
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,320
credential stuffing right this person i

844
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,120
say he

845
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
this person is not relying on credential

846
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,120
stuffing to try and compromise

847
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,799
uh facebook accounts as any good hacking

848
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,640
machine we would expect to see right

849
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,440
multiple text files with uh surnames

850
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,320
with first name

851
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,360
so you can create usernames um

852
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,480
password um files with

853
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,600
uh so the you know top 100 and top ten

854
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,960
thousands so

855
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,720
brute forcing is obviously a potential

856
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,840
in this person's world uh there were two

857
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,279
uh executables uh that were on the on

858
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,559
the system and not

859
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,279
not that had been that's the best way to

860
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,320
say that

861
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,919
uh two uh known rats right so known

862
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,480
malware the 13 kilobytes in size so very

863
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,000
small file

864
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,440
that are used right to fish

865
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,880
other users right so they're where

866
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,720
this person is using this rat malware

867
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,799
to fish for credentials uh

868
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,159
assumably right from those 4079 email

869
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,240
addresses

870
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,640
the web cache though has lots of stuff

871
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
so i find my victim's

872
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,039
login information so my politicians law

873
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:21,840
enforcement

874
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,679
my politicians uh facebook login

875
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,159
is in the webcast so obviously this is

876
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,919
the machine that did it and there's the

877
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,600
credentials on that

878
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,919
and i also find that there's cash there

879
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,600
for credentials

880
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,480
for our email address admin at

881
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,519
newenhainam.net

882
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,159
and that was also the email that was

883
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,440
listed

884
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,360
with the cloud provider as the contact

885
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,240
email so

886
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,799
now i know who it is where i know what

887
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,960
machine it is i think i know who it is

888
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,760
right i know how they're compromising

889
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,399
facebook

890
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,399
i know why they're compromising

891
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,480
facebook's they've managed to monetize

892
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,080
which is something we weren't seeing a

893
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,519
lot of previous

894
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,159
um and i might even have a lead as to

895
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,320
who this person is so of course

896
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,240
pull out the trusty um web browser

897
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,360
um and i go to the website and so hey

898
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,399
look it's

899
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,559
juan hainam and with google translate

900
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,320
currently i'm a lecturer and of course

901
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,799
on facebook advertising and the ceo of

902
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,600
mybeady mybe media

903
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,360
a company with five years experience

904
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,440
supporting dozens of

905
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,679
advertisers we will show you how to use

906
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,399
facebook advertising to be successful

907
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,600
and i guess it's pretty profitable if

908
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,760
you're taking money from clients to run

909
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,120
facebook advertising

910
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,600
and you're not actually spending that

911
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,720
money you're

912
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,080
doing it fraudulently so um

913
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,360
there was contact information i couldn't

914
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,480
resist

915
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,679
right so yes i sent him an email

916
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,600
and said hey i have putting together a

917
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,039
talk um

918
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,600
for a conference and i really would love

919
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,840
to talk to you beforehand

920
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,840
about um hacking social media accounts

921
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,760
and this whole facebook and how that

922
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,640
happens

923
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,480
um not surprisingly um

924
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
they haven't responded to me which is

925
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,440
kind of a bummer i would thought that

926
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,000
would be pretty

927
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,559
cool to get the hackers right

928
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,519
perspective on

929
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,000
how much how how successful are you

930
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,880
doing this and

931
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,640
and how much money are you really making

932
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,919
i think that would have been pretty

933
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,360
interesting and would love to put it

934
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,799
into the talk but

935
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,039
they chose not to respond but we

936
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,720
certainly can we can follow him on

937
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,000
facebook

938
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,480
so we've had that and i have not done so

939
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,200
but

940
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,240
um and again we see the address right

941
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,600
same address that was

942
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,510
listed in the cloud providers

943
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,840
[Music]

944
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,960
account information and it's in hanoi

945
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,480
vietnam so investigation challenge

946
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,600
number five

947
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,360
sometimes we can determine who did it

948
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,960
and how they did it and why they did it

949
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,199
but what can we do about someone who's

950
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,399
in vietnam

951
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,599
right u.s law enforcement has no

952
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,679
jurisdiction

953
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,199
outside of the country to to try and

954
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,560
arrest or to try and

955
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,960
even question someone in a foreign

956
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,599
country

957
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,839
you have to involve the state department

958
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,760
and the embassies and all that and

959
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,320
i'm pretty confident our current uh

960
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,359
administration

961
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,918
wouldn't get really excited about saying

962
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,199
hey we'd like to talk

963
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,960
to this hacker guy in hanoi vietnam

964
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,159
um about compromising facebook uh

965
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,440
accounts

966
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,639
so at this point we're just sort of

967
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,800
stuck and and even within the united

968
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,839
states

969
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,639
um state law enforcement sometimes will

970
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,239
have issues right so

971
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,079
it's pretty rare that uh a data breach

972
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,800
happens within a single state and so you

973
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,520
have this

974
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,480
multiple jurisdictions that might claim

975
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:04,880
uh

976
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,320
sort of um claim control

977
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,640
over that investigation which is

978
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,320
typically why we see

979
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,079
fbi doj secret service kind of take over

980
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,920
when when something moves beyond state

981
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,520
lines because it allows a federal entity

982
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,040
to conduct or to pursue an investigation

983
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,160
that hopefully results in an arrest of

984
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,040
some sort

985
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,040
so some of the lessons learned one

986
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,720
if you have not set up two-factor

987
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,960
authentication on any important account

988
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,599
really on all the airpoints

989
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,079
shame on you if if the company offers

990
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,920
two-factor authentication

991
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,320
absolutely it needs to be implemented

992
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,000
this is a way to prevent

993
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
uh some of the things that that can

994
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
happen inadvertently

995
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,200
or more from myself

996
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,000
conduct an email audit and so think back

997
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,079
make a list of all your previous email

998
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,440
addresses

999
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,560
and see if any of those right

1000
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,520
the audit part is how what what accounts

1001
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,599
were they used to log into at any point

1002
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,880
in the past

1003
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,079
because as mentioned facebook never

1004
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,440
forgets these things they

1005
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,320
they didn't forget credit card data that

1006
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,000
should have been very outdated

1007
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,760
um at that point but it was still in

1008
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,000
there

1009
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,839
and they were still able to um

1010
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,480
to try and charge ads against it there

1011
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,640
was an old email that was previously

1012
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,040
previously associated um with the

1013
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,000
account

1014
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,040
um you you would think that

1015
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,720
um that would be something that that

1016
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,480
facebook might block but apparently not

1017
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,320
um and then those connections between

1018
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,400
the two right between facebook and

1019
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,200
and paypal it's like hey how can this

1020
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
still be an active

1021
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,440
connection when it has been used for you

1022
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,400
know at that time 10 years

1023
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,079
or so it's like okay this is a problem

1024
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,200
if it was a private domain that you had

1025
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,880
um your email with um take steps to

1026
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,240
secure it right so

1027
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,040
i now i have a list i have a list of

1028
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,400
several domains that

1029
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,599
i will pay for every year pretty much

1030
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,119
for the rest of my life right

1031
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,880
i don't want to allow them to

1032
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,760
potentially uh be used against me

1033
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,440
for someone to come back and and try and

1034
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,880
compromise one of my accounts

1035
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,680
um lastly if if you were a victim of

1036
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,720
any kind of internet fraud um please

1037
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,599
report it

1038
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,440
uh law enforcement reports it and

1039
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,200
private entities can report it as well

1040
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,920
so

1041
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,240
it's the internet crime complaint center

1042
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,440
the ic3.gov

1043
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,359
it's an online form it's not a whole lot

1044
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,240
of data but that allows law enforcement

1045
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,079
to begin to compile

1046
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,040
um these trends right and we see is

1047
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,839
there an emerging trend

1048
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,200
that now hackers from vietnam are going

1049
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,000
to

1050
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,040
compromise social media and then attempt

1051
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,839
to

1052
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,880
monetize facebook advertising

1053
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,920
it's certainly a possibility one i had

1054
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,079
not seen before i was completely unaware

1055
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,240
of it as were other law enforcement

1056
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,640
uh officials that i talked to um about

1057
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,079
that right so this is well we haven't

1058
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,520
seen that before so is this

1059
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,000
kind of an emerging trend is it right

1060
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,640
it's like

1061
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,960
ransomware we we sort of point towards

1062
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,880
russia and the baltic states and

1063
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
uh banking uh trojans uh we we

1064
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,160
look at south america and brazil and say

1065
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,400
this is sort of that type of crime comes

1066
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,599
a lot from here

1067
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
um maybe social media attacks um

1068
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,040
and monetizing facebook advertising

1069
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,480
campaigns

1070
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,320
then maybe that's the thing the crime of

1071
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,599
choice in vietnam

1072
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,839
uh as we collect more data we'll be able

1073
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,839
to see that we'll know more of that

1074
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,240
so uh with that

1075
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,520
uh we are almost at our 45 minutes um

1076
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
i apologize if i went through quickly i

1077
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,440
didn't want to run long

1078
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,760

emails right northeast lakeview college

1086

1087
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,480
in san antonio and with that

1088
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,720
if anyone has questions i will be happy

1089
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:43,839
to answer them

1090
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,839
okay chip so in the question and answer

1091
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,200
section you can see

1092
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,480
um in the chat here um

1093
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,800
the first question we have at the top uh

1094
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,320
well like it's more of a statement isn't

1095
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,640
it

1096
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,320
oh amazing presentation chip i have a

1097
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,599
story to tell you it can happen to any

1098
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,480
one of us

1099
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,520
um this is from hernandez

1100
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,960
um well i think that might maybe

1101
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,599
be best handled uh over discord so if

1102
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,160
you get into

1103
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
the track two room in the beginning we

1104
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,200
can definitely talk through

1105
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,240
all of that after now but i'll go ahead

1106
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
and move on to the rest of the questions

1107
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,800
the second one is a if my email shows up

1108
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,160
on have i been pwned

1109
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,319
what can i do if that's my primary email

1110
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,599
address aside from just changing my

1111
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,640
password

1112
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,480
what what things might i go about doing

1113
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,720
there um so

1114
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,119
obviously making sure that you you keep

1115
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,480
your password changed

1116
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,359
kind of regularly and using complex

1117
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,240
passwords

1118
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,920
the most important thing about the have

1119
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,880
i been pwned is is not reusing passwords

1120
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,480
across multiple uh sites so credential

1121
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,520
stuffing is

1122
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,560
is one of the primary ways that that

1123
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,359
uh criminals are accessing accounts so

1124
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,160
you use

1125
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,200
the same password on eventbrite that you

1126
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,119
used on some other account

1127
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,680
and then suddenly right as they as they

1128
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,440
go through once that's

1129
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,520
hashed out now they have your password

1130
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,480
if it's reused

1131
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
that's the biggest problem so when

1132
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,839
you've looked through the have i been

1133
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,119
pwned just make sure

1134
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,839
that you didn't use that password

1135
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,359
because even if it says the password

1136
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,280
hasn't been recovered don't rely on that

1137
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,359
right so

1138
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,880
computers get faster and faster and

1139
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,800
faster

1140
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,599
and password hashes are they're just

1141
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,240
they're not gonna

1142
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,839
if they are still secure they won't be

1143
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,520
secure for very long so the biggest

1144
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,160
thing is

1145
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,839
is that making sure you're not reusing

1146
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,920
passwords there's nothing you do about

1147
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,319
it the data is out there and just

1148
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,000
make sure you never use that password

1149
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,240
again

1150
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,599
okay great i will go ahead and move on

1151
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,160
to

1152
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,079
our next question here this is from sage

1153
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,200
and clements does texas require

1154
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,119
peace officers license in order to

1155
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,640
establish digital forensics firm

1156
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,680
if so how rigorous is that process no

1157
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,359
they don't anymore

1158
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,480
um so previously

1159
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,640
texas said you had to be either a law

1160
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,760
enforcement officer

1161
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,119
or you had to hold a private

1162
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,280
investigator's license

1163
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,200
that's actually why i have the company

1164
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,040
alamo cyber security

1165
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,000
because back when i started doing

1166
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,760
network intrusion response

1167
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,520
you had to have a private investigator's

1168
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,359
license to do that and they've they've

1169
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,960
eliminated all that

1170
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,119
they kindly have figured out that just

1171
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,480
because you're a digital forensics

1172
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,359
person

1173
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,599
you don't need to worry about the law

1174
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,119
enforcement side of it and you don't

1175
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:31,680
need to be

1176
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,560
registered or licensed by some state

1177
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,319
entity to prove

1178
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,839
right that you understand the private

1179
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,599
investigation laws in texas

1180
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,599
which is really what that comes down to

1181
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,760
so no you don't and that's a great thing

1182
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,640
it opens that field up for

1183
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,560
lots of people we have students that are

1184
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,240
going through our programs or other

1185
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
programs that are majoring in forensics

1186
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
computer forensics

1187
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,920
you no longer have to be a peace officer

1188
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,520
to even work for a law enforcement

1189
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,240
agency in the field of digital forensics

1190
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,920
and so to become a peace officer

1191
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,640
it's a it's almost a full year of an

1192
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,680
academy

1193
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,920
there's it's not just a i want to take a

1194
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
study for a test and do that texas is

1195
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,079
really antiquated in its its law

1196
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,920
enforcement laws

1197
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,319
and so you'd have to go through almost

1198
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,319
full time for an entire year to become a

1199
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,760
peace officer

1200
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,839
and then if you become a peace officer

1201
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,000
unfortunately

1202
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,839
no matter what your background is in

1203
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,000
forensics or or digital stuff

1204
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,560
most agencies they're gonna put you out

1205
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
on patrol so i worked patrol for

1206
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,040
five years uh three of your three of

1207
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,839
those years

1208
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,000
working overnights and so not a lot

1209
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,079
happens in san antonio area i shouldn't

1210
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,359
say that some cool things some fun

1211
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,160
things happen

1212
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,920
between 10 in the morning or 10 at night

1213
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,839
and and six in the morning

1214
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,680
but you no longer have to do that to

1215
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,359
prove your worth

1216
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,200
before you can start doing investigation

1217
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,839
so that's a good thing

1218
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,839
okay um it looks like we're getting

1219
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:00,960
close to time but i'm going to go ahead

1220
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,079
and ask one more question

1221
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,359
live here and then we can take the rest

1222
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,520
of the questions offline into

1223
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,640
the the discord room so the

1224
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,760
last question here is um well

1225
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,000
first thank you for the presentation how

1226
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,520
do you believe that service providers

1227
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,040
can get better at preventing this type

1228
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,599
of abuse

1229
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,200
um gosh that's a

1230
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,480
that really is kind of a challenge um

1231
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,880
i'm not insensitive to them because you

1232
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,760
know

1233
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,599
someone like microsoft they have so many

1234
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,119
accounts that are out there and so many

1235
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,800
people trying to interact them it's it's

1236
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,160
tough for them and they're relying

1237
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,920
on um algorithms to prevent fraud so

1238
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,079
this particular cloud provider

1239
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,440
they ran an algorithm when that account

1240
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,560
was established

1241
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,119
based upon the address based upon what

1242
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,800
they wanted to do

1243
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,359
based upon the credit card data and it

1244
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,800
had a fairly high

1245
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,920
fraud score they

1246
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,599
still opened up an account for that

1247
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,200
person because

1248
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,440
the credit card wasn't a stolen credit

1249
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,960
card it was legitimately

1250
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
that business it was legitimately this

1251
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,720
person's credit card that was used to

1252
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,560
pay for the service

1253
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,760
and so short of monitoring the user's

1254
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,520
behavior i don't know how they could do

1255
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,839
that and

1256
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,160
uh for privacy purposes we probably

1257
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,359
don't want

1258
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,400
um a cloud provider monitoring all that

1259
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,040
we do

1260
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
with our virtual machines on their

1261
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,280
network right as long as i'm within your

1262
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,480
your uh your uh

1263
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,880
user agreement then you shouldn't really

1264
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,720
care exactly what i'm doing

1265
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,200
um and so i i don't know that's that's a

1266
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,079
that's a challenge

1267
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,920
i don't know that they could the biggest

1268
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,520
thing is just being responsive when they

1269
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,960
get a subpoena when they get a search

1270
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,920
warrant

1271
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
that's legitimate right assisting in the

1272
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,599
investigation

1273
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,240
it it moves things through quickly when

1274
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,520
they resist it

1275
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,400
um it slows things down to a crawl or

1276
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:56,960
kills

1277
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,319
right so for my account i mean that

1278
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,440
that my investigation died because

1279
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,480
i'm still waiting for godaddy right and

1280
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,040
maybe

1281
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,920
it's this same person i don't know um it

1282
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,560
could be

1283
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,920
it might be someone different maybe

1284
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,280
there's at least two different people

1285
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,200
that are doing this so

1286
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,040
that that's just a that's particularly a

1287
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,720
challenge so we're running out of time

1288
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,119
so

1289
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,560
