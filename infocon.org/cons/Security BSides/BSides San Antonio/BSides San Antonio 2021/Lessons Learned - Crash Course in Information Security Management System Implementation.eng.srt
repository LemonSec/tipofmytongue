here's rose

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,040
hi everyone thank you for coming to my

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,920
talk on

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,479
lessons learned crash course and isms

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,920
implementation

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
um i decided to submit this talk for

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,360
a presentation because over the past

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,159
couple years

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
i have gotten um in super crash course

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
and all things

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
isms um and in particular iso 27001

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,920
which we'll dig into as part of this

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,119
presentation

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,240
um so i decided to take all those things

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,799
i learned

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,759
the good the bad the ugly and figure out

51
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,640
how i could

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,960
better enable others to not be in a

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
position that they're

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,479
learning all these things while they're

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
doing an implementation

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,038
um so we're going to dig into what are

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,560
these lessons learned and how you can

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
learn from them and what you should

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
consider as part of your own

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,239
implementation

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,720
so uh first things first a little bit

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
about me my name is rose

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,400
um i am a governance risking compliance

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
manager for skiso

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,720
um and we're based in pittsburgh so as

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,280
part

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,760
um of what i do at my company actually

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,480
what my dell

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,280
company does as a whole is we work with

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,000
companies

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
that are looking to improve their

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
security posture through various

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,080
mechanisms

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,840
um they could be looking to improve

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
cloud security

76
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
enterprise security um

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,239
their governance first compliance

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,760
programs and all sorts of things like

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,000
that

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
and so our company works with small to

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,920
mid-size

82
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
companies that are looking to improve

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
those security postures

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,959
and they may be looking to do it for a

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
variety of reasons it may be

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,120
you know compliance or regulatory driven

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
or they've had incidents in which they

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
decided that they're going to try to put

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,720
better security measures in

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,319
um so what i do at csvo is i'm a

91
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,480
governance risk and compliance manager

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,840
and i oversee all of our grc

93
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,440
services including development of those

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,080
services

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,879
and innovating in those services as well

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,920
as the execution

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
teams so i provide all oversight to the

98
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,280
grc functionality at eso

99
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
um i have a master's in cyber security

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
and a bachelor's in

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,400
advanced networking i've been in it for

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
15 years i

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
joined um the navy right out of high

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,280
school at 18

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,080
and ended up spending a lot of time in

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,040
i.t

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
uh resulted in spending about a year as

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,120
a network engineer

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
implementing statistics on routers and

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,159
switches and

111
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,159
um i started really getting a taste of

112
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,760
security when i did that role in the

113
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,519
navy and so when i transit

114
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,319
transitioned out of being in the navy um

115
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,439
i decided to pursue

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,280
security and so the last nine years has

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
been just security focused

118
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,959
uh and primarily governance risk and

119
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,080
compliance

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,879
have tons of industry experience um just

121
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
based on the different jobs that i've

122
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,040
had

123
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
being in the military and now being a

124
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,160
consultant

125
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,040
um and then also i always like to call

126
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
him out because he likes to make himself

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
known for all of my presentations that i

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,520
do

129
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,320
or any virtual meetings i do have a

130
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
co-presenter with me today his name is

131
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,280
dexter

132
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,240
he uh may clean himself during this

133
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
presentation i promise you guys i will

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,479
make sure that he keeps it to a minimum

135
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,960
uh so what i also like to do as part of

136
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,720
my presentations because i like to do

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
what i call show and tell

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,560
um just so you guys get to know a little

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
bit about me

140

i'm not talking at you you're getting to

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,360
put some of the qualities of me towards

142
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
what i'm actually talking about

143
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
um so like i said i'm in pittsburgh i've

144
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,960
been in pittsburgh for a couple years

145
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,600
now since

146
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,639
around 2017. um i have two kids one's

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,120
middle school

150
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
and i just makes me feel much much much

151
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,880
older than i actually am and i'm married

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,440
so

153
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,280
um that's a little bit about me and my

154
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,479

171
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
version of all the things i've been

172

experiencing recently

173
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,039
um as one's the item of note i used

174
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,520
recently used these same materials as

175
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
part of a capstone that i was teaching

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
at duquesne university here in

177
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,440
pittsburgh i taught

178
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
some students on how they would go about

179
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,800
implementing

180
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,960
isms so some of these materials were

181
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,720
pulled directly from that class that i

182
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,440
taught

183
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,759
um so we're going to talk about what

184
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,000
exactly is an isms

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
is it even worth implementing um ongoing

186
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,720
program maintenance

187
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,080
and iso 27001 breakdown

188
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,000
so the iso is a big component of what

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,759
we're going to talk about today

190
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
um and so when i say isms

191
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,319
keep iso 27001 in mind

192
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
now what exactly is the isms i've

193
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,960
referred to it multiple times now

194
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
but what does that mean so it stands for

195
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
information security management system

196
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,039
and it's essentially it is a cycle of

197
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,400
continuous improvement

198
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
leveraging the plan do check pack so

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
the graph there on the right you can

200
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,199
leverage that

201
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,039
to develop your isms and what it's going

202
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,120
to do is take all these processes and

203
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
this governance and

204
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
um policies and things like that and

205
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
they're going to put it

206
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
into place with the security controls

207
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
and the whole idea behind this is not

208
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,919
only are you improving

209
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,560
um via the continuous improvement cycle

210
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
but you're hitting that really important

211
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
aspect of security that we always hit on

212
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
in security and this confidentiality

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
integrity and availability um

214
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
any of that data or any of that data or

215
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,319
the information in your control

216
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
um so the isms is going to take those

217
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
fundamentals and they're going to put it

218
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
into a standardized way that you can

219
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,599
have that ongoing management of your

220
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,599
program

221
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,479
so return on investment isn't even worth

222
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,440
doing

223
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,840
absolutely i think it is 150

224
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,880
worth doing um if you do it right if you

225
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,840
don't do it right

226
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,520
and you miss the things that you need to

227
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
do it may result in rework

228
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
um extra budget and things like that so

229
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
it's really important to do your due

230
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,800
diligence before you even

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
implement to make sure that you know

232
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,319
what you're getting into

233
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,319
but i promise you well worth the

234
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,240
investment as long as you make sure you

235
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
do your due diligence ahead of time to

236
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,759
understand what you're doing

237
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,400
um so return on investment you're gonna

238
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,000
have better communication

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,560
you're gonna have better transparency so

240
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,919
your isms

241
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,039
it really is all about the communication

242
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,879
all about making sure the workforce

243
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,800
understands all about making sure

244
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,199
management understands and so

245
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,319
naturally you're going to build

246
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,400
communication and transparency

247
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,560
look at him told you he always pleased

248
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,520
himself

249
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,639
um let's see competitive advantage

250
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,080
whenever you are providing services to

251
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,679
another party

252
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,760
obviously you want to have a competitive

253
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
advantage over

254
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,279
other people that maybe are delivering

255
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,360
on those same services so

256
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
um this will give you a leg up on your

257
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,040
competition

258
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
uh additionally clients are going to

259
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,399
start requesting proof that you have

260
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,760
security controls in place

261
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,560
so um your iso certification is going to

262
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
be able to allow you to say

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
here your third party we have all the

264
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,839
controls in place

265
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
you can look at our certification you

266
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,040
can look at our statement of

267
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
ability and you can see all these things

268
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,240
um

269
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,760
improves your resilience to cyber

270
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,519
attacks so

271
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,279
we've seen it over and over again

272
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,519
recently cyber attacks are

273
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,040
becoming more known throughout the world

274
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
and the media is definitely playing a

275
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
big part on highlighting these things

276
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,360
happening

277
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,320
um so this will allow your organization

278
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
to be better prepared

279
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
when those things happen so when not if

280
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,519
because likely a lot organizations are

281
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,640
going to have a breach

282
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
um going to experience a cyber attack in

283
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
some way and so this allows you just to

284
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,839
be better prepared

285
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,040
you're going to improve your change

286
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
management so no pushes to fraud

287
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
no changes in the infrastructure

288
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,760
anything like that without making sure

289
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
that security was involved in the

290
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,480
discussions and making sure that

291
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,760
security is good with this change

292
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,480
this is probably my favorite aspect of

293
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,839
return on investment for

294
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,640
isms it's building blocks to other

295
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
frameworks

296
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
um short story time i have two different

297
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
clients that recently did

298
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,640
and um an iso implementation

299
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
um one client decided that

300
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,480
they um they actually implemented iso a

301
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,279
couple years ago

302
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,560
we've been doing their surveillance

303
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,399
audits they decided to build

304
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,440
i trust on top of their framework and so

305
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
they built all the high trust

306
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
controls there was about 293 into their

307
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,360
framework and they were

308
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
able to leverage their isms to ensure

309
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,000
they have compliance against those

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,959
controls

311
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,760
and then i had another client they had

312
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
an aggressive timeline that was being

313
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
forced by a client

314
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
client said hey you have to get the

315
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,399
certification within the timeline that

316
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:40,880
they're

317
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,760
saying and so they did an iso

318
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
implementation with soft too

319
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,240
and so it truly is a building block to

320
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,519
other frameworks

321
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
to other things that you're trying to

322
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
achieve so just keep that in mind as a

323
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,040
good return on investment if your

324
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
organization has

325
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
tight dreams of wanting to get you know

326
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,800
tons of um different frameworks

327
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,440
implemented

328
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
this is definitely your starting point

329
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,640
and will set you up for future

330
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,040
success and then enforces that

331
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
continuous improvement lifecycle so we

332
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,640
talked about that on the previous slide

333
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,600
uh program management so

334
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
your isms is wonderful at

335
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
um building that organizational culture

336
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,640
uh

337
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,519
my one client that they have isms and

338
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,240
high trust

339
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,360
or iso and nitrous their organization is

340
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,279
very security focused

341
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,279
um and that is because of all the

342
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,880
curating of

343
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
understanding non-conformities and

344
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,160
understanding opportunities for

345
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,880
improvement

346
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,560
and enabling the workforce to know when

347
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
to come to security and when to report

348
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,760
and having risk management meetings and

349
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
doing all these things

350
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,440
not only that up the team the senior

351
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
leadership understand this as well

352
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,880
so you'll have really good program

353
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,200
management um you'll have auditable

354
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
artifacts so we'll get into prepping for

355
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,519
audit um at the tail end of this

356
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,959
presentation

357
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,800
and then it requires top management

358
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,399
support so

359
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,720
you absolutely cannot do this without

360
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,000
leadership buying and we're going to

361
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,839
touch on that in a little bit

362
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,959
so make sure you have that buy-in and

363
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
have it continuous buy-in you can't just

364
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,399
have it once

365
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,480
at implementation it needs to be during

366
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,200
the ongoing maintenance of this program

367
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,959
and then you're going to need to have an

368
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,639
internal audit so you have to have

369
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,920
internal audit

370
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,480
um just to ensure that your program is

371
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,040
operating right

372
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,399
so let's talk about iso a little bit now

373
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,639
we talked about what exactly is the isms

374
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,079
and things like that

375
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,760
iso 27001 um this is built

376
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,240
off of information security management

377
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
system isms

378
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,880
and the isotropic 7001 is broken into

379
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,399
two different areas

380
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,040
you have clauses four through ten and

381
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,920
you have annex

382
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,360
a clauses four through ten are mandatory

383
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,320
you must do

384
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,600
every single thing listed in that clause

385
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
and keep in mind that each of the clause

386
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,200
has sub bullets and you have to make

387
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,160
sure that you're hitting

388
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
all of them now annex a is a little bit

389
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,519
different

390
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,959
annex a is a catalog of information

391
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,480
security controls

392
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,320
that are only mandatory as a result

393
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,160
of a risk assessment so what i mean is

394
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,720
you did a risk assessment you have

395
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
unacceptable risk

396
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,160
you create a risk treatment plan and

397
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,839
that risk treatment plan

398
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,519
results in remediation

399
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,800
of the unacceptable risk through annex

400
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,199
a so when you look at annex a there's

401
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,920
roughly 114 controls and you can see

402
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,720
um on the graph on the right the bottom

403
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,120
graph

404
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
it breaks it down into the different

405
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,639
areas that encompass those 114 controls

406
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,199
so when you select the controls to

407
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,519
remediate your unacceptable risk

408
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,880
those are going to be the mandatory

409
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,360
controls that you have to implement

410
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,519
now most organizations end up

411
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,600
implementing all the nsa

412
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
um so that way whenever they do get

413
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,680
audited and you have your statement of

414
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,639
applicability

415
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,160
you're not going to have any exclusions

416
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
to your program but just keep in mind

417
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,079
that the only things that are mandatory

418
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,760
are the only things that result from the

419
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,800
risk assessment

420
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,319
and the clause is four thirds

421
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
so that's that's your high level

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,440
overview like i said that was going to

423
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,360
be a super crash course

424
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
and isms and iso it's not meant to

425
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,600
um you know give you the full breakdown

426
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,760
it's just meant to level set you guys

427
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,560
um and kind of take you along with these

428
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,839
other lessons learned that i have here

429
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,760
so what are the must-do items

430
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
um what are the things that are expected

431
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
of you as you go through

432
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,279
iso certification as you implement isms

433
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,839
um the first thing that i want to call

434
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,680
mandatory documents

435
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,360
so um while we talk about the isms

436
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,199
a large component of it is going to be

437
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,120
governance risk and compliance

438
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,440
um in some capacity and the very first

439
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,760
item here is definitely hitting on that

440
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,120
um but in addition to governance risk

441
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,240
and compliance

442
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
keep in mind there's a very high

443
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,600
technical part of this

444
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
um if you recall the one graph that i

445
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
pointed out about nxa

446
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,959
over half of those controls are it

447
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,600
related and i.t is vague in this sense

448
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,320
um

449
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
so just keep that in mind that while grc

450
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
will largely govern the program

451
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,880
there's going to be a technical

452
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
component that will need to contribute

453
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,399
to things like the mandatory documents

454
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,160
and other things going on

455
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
so we'll jump into the mandatory

456
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
documents more um in more depth here in

457
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,199
a second

458
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,800
we'll also talk about the anatomy of

459
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,440
this vote statement and what that means

460
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,560
we'll talk about the statement of

461
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,360
applicability um we're not going to deal

462
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,560
with the

463
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,399
clauses four through ten because quite

464
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
frankly they're quite expensive

465
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,720
if you are going to go down the path of

466
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
pursuing iso 27001

467
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
um highly recommend that you become very

468
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
familiar with expectations of clauses

469
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,639
4-10

470
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,759
they are must-do items uh implementation

471
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
of annexate controls based on

472
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,120
unacceptable risk we talked about that

473
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,399
on the last slide

474
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,959
and then internal on it so you have to

475
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,399
have internal audit

476
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,199
and it has to be done before your audits

477
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,360
your stage one and your stage two

478
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
so um make sure that you have

479
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
implemented your program fully

480
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,759
you uh scheduled your internal audit

481
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,160
you if you don't have an internal audit

482
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
function you pick an internal auditor

483
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,759
that's reputable that understands how to

484
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,040
audit iso

485
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,759
and have them come in maybe a month

486
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,920
before you decide to do your stage one

487
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
this will allow you time to take the

488
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,920
findings get them into a repository and

489
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,720
take additional actions on them

490
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,360
so mandatory documents let's talk about

491
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,800
those real quick

492
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
so mandatory documents as you guys can

493
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680
see that's a really long list

494
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,039
very long um not all of these things are

495
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,880
mandatory so it's kind of deceiving but

496
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
kind of not

497
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
the mandatory documents that come from

498
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,199
the clauses are mandatory you have to do

499
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,160
those

500
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,640
the items noted as a.7.1.2

501
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,319
a dot something those come from annex a

502
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,720
those items are only mandatory as a

503
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,799
result of the risk assessment so common

504
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,240
theme going on here

505
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,520
annex a items are only applicable as a

506
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
result of the risk assessment for

507
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,400
remediation of

508
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,520
those unacceptable risks um

509
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
so if you end up implementing all the

510
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,880
nxa then you'll have

511
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,000
all of these mandatory documents um

512
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,840
and like i said it's not just going to

513
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
be governance for some compliance

514
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,679
you need you have to have an inventory

515
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,240
of assets you need to

516
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
have uh secure system engineering

517
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,440
principles

518
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
you need to have incident management um

519
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,880
and all of those

520
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,559
components stretch across different

521
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,640
groups so definitely not governance risk

522
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,840
and compliance

523
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,960
um our group is just largely largely

524
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,640
going to be responsible for

525
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,880
um ensuring that we hit these things but

526
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,160
not necessarily

527
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,360
being the the sneeze of this data

528
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,640
so anatomy of a scope statement this was

529
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
also something that i stole from my

530
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
capstone but

531
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,039
i stole it because i thought it was

532
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,440
really good information to give you guys

533
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,039
now for your iso certification you have

534
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,280
to identify the scope of your isms

535
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
what are you protecting what are you

536
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,280
implementing this for and so the anatomy

537
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
of a scope statement is really meant to

538
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,679
highlight

539
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,000
what exactly you're trying to do trying

540
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
to illustrate

541
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,160
via your scope statement so

542
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,919
the isms which protects the

543
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,440
confidentiality integrity and

544
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,120
availability

545
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,400
very first part of your anatomy that cia

546
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,440
triad um you're gonna

547
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,760
address the business processes so

548
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,559
information and

549
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,480
information processing facilities

550
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,400
supporting outpatient services

551
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,880
specializing in mental et cetera

552
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,520
services

553
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
healthcare related so those are your

554
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,120
business processes

555
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
that's your second component then you're

556
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,720
going to state where

557
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
where are you doing these things at and

558
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
then what are the applicable controls

559
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
and in this case you can just

560
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,960
point to your statement of applicability

561
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,559
so essentially you have four parts of

562
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,240
this anatomy statement

563
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,640
or the scope of the anatomy of a scope

564
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
statement

565
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
additionally you may have an isms scope

566
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
document that's

567
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,280
much larger and a little more detailed

568
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,360
than just the scope statement

569
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,720
so um your iso scope document

570
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,960
may have who you're interested parties

571
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
are it may

572
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,480
discuss the processes a little more

573
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
detailed so just keep that in mind as

574
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,240
you build this document

575
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,919
um you definitely have to have your

576
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,520
scope statement and it definitely needs

577
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,160
to explain

578
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,960
what your isms is at a high level what

579
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,320
you're trying to achieve with it

580
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
statement of applicability highly highly

581
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,840
highly important document

582
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,000
this document could potentially be

583
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
client facing if you

584
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,200
are allowing um your certification to

585
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,640
leave your control maybe you're trying

586
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,120
to

587
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,880
prove that you have security controls in

588
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,480
place so

589
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
for your statement of applicability it

590
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,240
is built in a way that

591
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,520
it highlights all of the 114 controls

592
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,159
from annex

593
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,880
it and it says here's the annexate

594
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,840
control

595
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,080
here is the statement of the control and

596
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,760
here's a description

597
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,039
now you're going to say whether that

598
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,360
control is applicable or not

599
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,400
and then you're going to provide a

600
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,720
justification and the justification is

601
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,159
going to be

602
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,880
the result of a risk assessment or maybe

603
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,520
a legal

604
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
or regulatory requirement driving you to

605
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
get that um

606
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,039
particular control in place you're gonna

607
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,400
see the control status

608
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,960
so uh whether it's fully implemented

609
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,039
partially implemented etc

610
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,760
and then any other comments so while

611
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,720
this document

612
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,559
i think it has about four controls on

613
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,640
here it's gonna be much longer

614
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,400
it's gonna have more detail and um

615
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
just keep in mind that i do have it

616
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,640
shown on here as a spreadsheet

617
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
one of the things that i want to call

618
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
out maybe as my first lesson learn

619
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
it doesn't need to be a spreadsheet it

620
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
doesn't need to be a word document

621
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
it can be whatever that you want it to

622
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,080
be so these processes

623
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,919
should highlight the good things that

624
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,919
you're already doing and not

625
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
burden everybody with the new things

626
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,200
that you want to do

627
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,400
so um if you have a way to track these

628
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,880
things

629
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
in a different way that you want to

630
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,320
leverage

631
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
absolutely do it there's no hard and

632
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
fast requirement stating that you have

633
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,600
to do it in a spreadsheet you have to do

634
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
an award document

635
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,120
um in fact i have a client who leveraged

636
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,720
monday.com which is a project management

637
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,360
tool

638
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,080
to have their statement of applicability

639
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,280
to have their

640
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,000
governance inventory to have their

641
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,240
access control reviews to have their

642
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,600
interested parties

643
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,679
all in this tool that they're already

644
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,880
using so

645
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
keep that in mind as you build this out

646
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
doesn't need to be overly complex

647
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
it can absolutely leverage the things

648
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
that you have in place to date

649
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,280
so this is one of my favorite sections

650
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,080
it's don't skip where it counts

651
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,320
so we talked about the mandatory things

652
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,200
um

653
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
and some of these things probably could

654
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,520
be considered mandatory however i would

655
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,280
have called these out as don't skip in

656
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,320
these places

657
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,360
or you will definitely regret it um

658
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,559
my first words of wisdom here

659
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,919
buy and use the standard don't

660
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,120
try to use online sources to implement

661
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,600
isms buy the iso 27001 standard

662
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,360
make sure you have it available because

663
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,760
when the external auditors come

664
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,280
they are going to want to know that you

665
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
bought that standard and you implemented

666
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
everything in accordance with that

667
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,360
standard

668
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,039
if you did not buy it then they're going

669
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,799
to question how you went about

670
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,559
implementing it and so you're just going

671
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,760
to be in a pickle

672
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,320
buy and use that standard it has all the

673
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,039
information

674
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,240
in it that you need um obviously you'll

675
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,559
want to research and do other things but

676
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,080
it has all the things that you need to

677
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,720
do

678
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,640
um to implement your iso program

679
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,159
successfully

680
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,360
now if you want to take it a step

681
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,520
further there is an additional standard

682
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,240
that you can buy

683
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,799
to support iso 27001 and that is called

684
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,720
iso 27002

685
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,720
it is a um

686
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,919
hulked up version of iso 27001 for lack

687
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,039
of better words

688
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,080
so you can use the 27002

689
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,679
to better understand the controls in

690
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:47,919
27001

691
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,400
it is meant to be more informative to

692
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,760
break it down a little bit better for

693
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,840
you so you understand what you are doing

694
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,000
um definitely buy buy iso 27001

695
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
iso 27002 is optional um if you feel

696
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
like you need that additional support

697
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,200
my next item here is communication

698
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
exclamation point exclamation point

699
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,520
exclamation point all in the cell is

700
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,480
highly highly highly important we're

701
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,520
going to talk about this

702
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,360
a little bit more here in a second i

703
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,960
think it's so important that it deserves

704
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
its own sub bullet area

705
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,919
so we're going to talk about that in a

706
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,480
second um risk assessments

707
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,159
we call it out as something that you

708
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,640
need to do for determining your

709
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,720
answer items and that probably should be

710
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,159
listed as mandatory

711
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,279
activity please

712
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,559
please please do a risk assessment and

713
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,720
do it

714
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,679
as well as you can and what i want you

715
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,320
to do

716
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,679
is know your environment don't let

717
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,720
anybody tell you

718
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,960
don't let asset owners don't let system

719
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,400
owners

720
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,799
process owners tell you that they don't

721
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,840
have risk

722
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,679
that there's no risk associated with

723
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,440
their assets or systems

724
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,279
applications whatever it is because i'm

725
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,799
here to tell you today

726
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,919
everything has risk so push back when

727
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,360
you need to push back

728
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
don't allow them to tell you that

729
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
there's no risk because i guarantee you

730
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,320
there are risks um

731
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,840
it's just a matter of getting it down um

732
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
and know your environment spend the time

733
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,679
doing the risk assessment

734
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,080
i promise you it will pay off you will

735
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
get to know the environment better

736
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
you'll be able to secure it better

737
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,880
and you'll be able to go back to the

738
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
triad the confidentiality integrity and

739
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,400
availability

740
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,159
so if you know what risks are in your

741
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,600
environment

742
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
you can anticipate you can remediate you

743
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,679
can do all these things but if you don't

744
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,799
know your environment

745
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,320
you're not going to be able to do that

746
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,400
so make sure you're doing that

747
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,960
and this is another component that is

748
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,480
not just grc

749
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,120
it is highly technical so keep that in

750
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,720
mind make sure you pull your tech

751
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
resources to be involved in the

752
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,080
conversation if you

753
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
um maybe aren't in a place to do the

754
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,520
conversation yourself

755
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,880
pull on your resources budget

756
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,760
so for budget um i'm not just talking

757
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,159
about

758
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,679
your your money or your resources i'm

759
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,080
absolutely talking about your capacity

760
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,799
um

761
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,640
how you'll go about implementation of

762
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
this program and then

763
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,799
tying into the bullet that i have lower

764
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,679
down

765
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,760
is knowing how you're going to manage

766
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,400
this program on an ongoing basis

767
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,360
so your isms implementation is not a

768
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,480
once and done

769
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,240
um this is something that's highly

770
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,559
important to communicate ahead of time

771
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,880
if people believe it's a once and done

772
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,320
then you have a lot of communication

773
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,760
ahead of you and you need to budget

774
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,120
appropriately

775
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,279
um which it also includes considering

776
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,559
how much time you're going to need to

777
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,080
spend on governance

778
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
how many resource hours you're going to

779
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,760
spend on that um

780
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
figuring out if you need to outsource

781
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,880
internal audit

782
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,919
and items like that so don't skimp here

783
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
make sure you dedicate some time to it

784
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,360
and if you're not the right person find

785
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,880
the right person help you figure out

786
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,960
what your budget should be

787
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,679
um leadership buy-in this is an

788
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,720
important one

789
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,240
we're going gonna have its own slide for

790
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,120
it because this is a foundational item

791
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
of your isms

792
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,039
um same with corrective action process

793
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,559
we're gonna talk about that one

794
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,120
a little more in detail here in a couple

795
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,480
slides so we're just gonna skip that one

796
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,520
for now

797
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,200
um the next one i'm gonna tell you guys

798
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,640
a short story

799
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,840
i have been in two

800
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,200
audits where i have witnessed someone

801
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,320
getting in trouble

802
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,760
for this fine item and it is do not

803
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,159
use the iso logo unless you are

804
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,840
authorized

805
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,279
i cannot like i

806
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,039
i can't even make this up i have seen

807
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,200
people get in trouble for using that

808
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,080
logo

809
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,279
during an audit do not use the isolonkit

810
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,039
logo do not use the iso logo

811
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,200
that you have googled you pulled from a

812
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
website

813
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,480
just don't do it don't do it internally

814
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,080
don't do it externally

815
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,120
don't use that logo it is big no no

816
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,279
bad juju comes with it i've seen it two

817
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,360
different times just don't do it

818
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
um after you pass your certification

819
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,720
there are

820
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,360
approved logos that you can use make

821
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
sure you work with your external auditor

822
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,279
to have the right logo

823
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,559
um if you use the wrong logo

824
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,200
you are at risk of receiving a major

825
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
non-conformity during your audit

826
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,399
they may pull it they will do whatever

827
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,000
i've seen it happen twice

828
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,640
where they almost lost it it was very

829
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,240
close paul so please make sure

830
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,520
you're using the right logos um

831
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,600
now you're interested parties so

832
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
interested parties it's

833
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
kind of a vague word right um interested

834
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,880
parties

835
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,520
are your internal so who's invested in

836
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,320
your program

837
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,360
could be slt it could be um

838
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
you know it could be software

839
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,039
engineering whoever

840
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,279
it's just who internally is invested in

841
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,399
your program

842
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,640
now on the other side of that you have

843
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,799
internal and now you need external

844
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
so external maybe outside legal counsel

845
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,159
maybe

846
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,279
clients it may be family members

847
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,120
associated with their employees

848
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,279
um maybe patients things like that so

849
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,720
those are your external

850
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,399
and then to take it a step further as

851
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,159
part of your interested parties

852
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,279
you also want to consider um

853
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,159
legal regulatory and contractual

854
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,840
obligations and you want to make sure

855
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,279
you're tracking those things because

856
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,039
your auditor is going to want to know

857
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,960
that you know what is applicable to your

858
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,640
environment and that you are

859
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,159
checking those items and you have them

860
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,720
implemented say for example

861
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,520
the anatomy of a scope statement that is

862
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
a health care facility so they have

863
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,600
a security role that the privacy rule

864
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,559
applicable to them

865
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,840
and auditors are going to want to

866
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
understand that you know that that is

867
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
something that you have to adhere to as

868
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,799
part of

869
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,320
the services you're delivering so make

870
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
sure you know your interested parties

871
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
um and have them in some sort of

872
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,919
repository

873
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,840
um maintain your program after

874
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,039
implementation

875
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,840
i have personally experienced

876
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,480
where an isms was implemented

877
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,039
that i was not present for six months

878
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,240
later i was brought

879
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,279
in to provide ongoing maintenance of

880
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,000
their program

881
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,720
so meaning i was providing oversight

882
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,679
doing the day-to-day

883
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,480
activities and for six months their

884
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,600
program did not

885
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,320
operate and essentially what happened

886
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
when i got my hands on the program

887
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,799
it resulted in months of rework to

888
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,799
re-establish their program

889
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,919
so if you're not planning to maintain

890
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,320
your program after implementation

891
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,080
this is what i was talking about during

892
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,520
return on investment

893
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,720
or is it worth it you could risk losing

894
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
a lot of money

895
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,000
in that work that you did by having to

896
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
do rework by not managing

897
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,000
it continuously so keep that in mind

898
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,919
make sure you're planning for it

899
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,799
um understand your isms is not just

900
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
governance for single clients i've been

901
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,799
on this so many times

902
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,240
please make sure that it is not siloed

903
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
to grc

904
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,880
this program is so important that

905
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,440
all components of your org should be

906
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,799
involved they should know

907
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,640
i'm going to tell you guys i spend a lot

908
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,000
of time talking with my tech

909
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,360
teams that are involved in these

910
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,440
projects um

911
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,120
to get to understand their environment

912
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,960
to make sure that we have everything

913
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
implemented that's applicable and things

914
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,240
like that there is a high

915
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,200
tech component here so understand not

916
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,399
just grc

917
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,840
um we largely govern it yes but we

918
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,080
are definitely not the implementers of

919
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,559
all the things so just keep that in mind

920
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,600
and now the last bullet the item

921
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,440
the last item of don't skip where it

922
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,120
counts so

923
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,840
um those are an achievable time frame

924
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,919
work with all the people that need to be

925
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,720
involved

926
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,519
understand their capacity um understand

927
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,200
what the tech teams can take on

928
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,840
understand what legal can take on in hr

929
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,919
and build a timeline that is actually

930
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,120
achievable

931
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,159
if you build an aggressive timeline

932
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,519
you could decrease morale

933
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,240
you can set yourself up for unrealistic

934
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,000
expectations you can do all these

935
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,640
things so make it achievable for your

936
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,200
org

937
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,640
along with business objectives i have

938
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,960
definitely witnessed times where there

939
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,799
are things that needed to happen

940
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,320
but the business did not have the

941
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,080
capacity to implement

942
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,200
and you don't want to be in that

943
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,039
position so make sure that you're

944
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,640
building this timeline

945
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,159
i can tell you that i have personally

946
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:36,640
led

947
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,600
a very aggressive timeline we did the

948
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,039
iso implementation

949
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,880
by time we were doing their stage one

950
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,799
audit it was six months

951
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,240
it's very doable it's very miserable

952
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,360
it's not fun and we know that going into

953
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,039
it so if you choose to do aggressive

954
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,000
timeline

955
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,320
everybody should be bottom everybody

956
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,840
should understand

957
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,640
this is aggressive you need to be on

958
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,600
board for it

959
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,640
so keep that in mind all right

960
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,159
communication gets its own area

961
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,240
not everybody's going to be bought in we

962
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
all know this

963
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,039
know your audience so speak the language

964
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,320
of management

965
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,399
speak the language of the implementers

966
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,559
and speak the language of the workforce

967
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,880
three distinct types of people that you

968
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,080
need to talk to

969
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,120
that you need to went over it's not good

970
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,960
enough just to have one of these groups

971
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,399
bought in you need to make sure that

972
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,159
everybody gets communicated and

973
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,960
everybody's bought in um because these

974
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,399
are the foundational pieces

975
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,679
of your program your program is not

976
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,039
going to be optimal

977
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,480
unless these people are bought in and

978
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,399
they're doing things that they need to

979
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,519
so speak all the languages and one thing

980
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,640
i like to tap on

981
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,760
here a little nugget that i applied to

982
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
security awareness

983
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,720
and i got this from a um

984
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
nist sands white paper

985
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,039
a couple years ago their

986
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,200
approach to security awareness which i

987
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,640
love is

988
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,599
take it from a marketing aspect what are

989
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,760
you trying to get people to buy

990
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,800
or invest in and market to them

991
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,399
in that way so we want these people to

992
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:18,639
be

993
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,280
invested well what's in it for them and

994
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,119
how can we get them invested in it and

995
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,040
if we can get them invested in it

996
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,879
the communication is going to be better

997
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,320
they're going to absorb the things we

998
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,159
want them to do better so keep that in

999
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,719
mind

1000
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,960
think of it as marketing and know your

1001
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,560
audience know how to market to your

1002
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,079
audience and you will be highly

1003
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,639
successful

1004
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,760
leadership buy-in assemble your best

1005
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,199
infosec team

1006
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,000
to make sure that you are building a

1007
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,839
business case and that you are selling

1008
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,040
to leadership and this

1009
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,079
ties into knowing your audience grab

1010
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,000
those return on investment items i had

1011
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,239
at the beginning of this presentation

1012
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,480
build your business case and make sure

1013
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,000
leadership's buy-in because i

1014
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
promise you external auditors going to

1015
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,040
want to talk to them

1016
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,200
and your program needs to operate with

1017
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,400
leadership i am

1018
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
so be like the anchorman here assemble

1019
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,480
your best infosec team

1020
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,599
your best increment team and uh make

1021
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,640
sure that you're doing

1022
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,920
all this to get their buyer now

1023
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,560
the last area that we're going to dig

1024
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,240
into a little bit deeper as far as don't

1025
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,079
skipping where it counts

1026
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,359
corrective action plans

1027
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,400
please use 10.1

1028
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,960
pause 10.1 for non-conformity and

1029
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,480
corrective action

1030
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,599
this clause tells you verbatim what is

1031
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,720
expected within a corrective action plan

1032
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,960
it is very important that you have this

1033
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,640
process defined

1034
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,119
and in place before you go through any

1035
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:47,920
audit

1036
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,720
this is a foundational component of isms

1037
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,320
as well as a couple of the other things

1038
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,720
that i

1039
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,280
mentioned the repository it could be a

1040
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,440
grc tool it could be a spreadsheet

1041
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,920
it can be whatever you want again going

1042
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,079
back to that example i have seen someone

1043
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,520
use monday.com

1044
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,359
not just statement of applicability and

1045
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,720
governance inventory

1046
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,320
they used it for their corrective action

1047
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,760
plans too they used it like

1048
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,720
a ticketing system so make sure that you

1049
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,800
have that in place

1050
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,119
and don't forget your root cause

1051
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,160
analysis

1052
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,839
if you do not hit the root cause

1053
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,560
analysis the non-conformity is never

1054
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
really going to be resolved in the eyes

1055
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,680
of the auditor

1056
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,280
they're going to want to see that you

1057
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,720
identified the root cause

1058
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
and as part of your corrective actions

1059
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,640
you remediated the root cause

1060
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,760
therefore stopping any other future

1061
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
occurrences of that same non-conformity

1062
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,079
so just make sure you have that

1063
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,599
addressed as part of

1064
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,280
your production plans um i just do a 5y

1065
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,520
root cause analysis for non-conformities

1066
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,480
it's simple

1067
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,640
just y all the way down the thread until

1068
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
you get to the bottom

1069
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,720
um and relatively simple to implement

1070
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,760
you just have to make sure that you're

1071
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,160
hitting

1072
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,200
all those components

1073
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
okay so that's a lot a lot we've

1074
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,160
discussed so far

1075
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,079
we have a couple more areas to go and

1076
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,760
then we'll wrap this up

1077
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,359
actually we have one area to go and then

1078
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,760
we'll wrap this up

1079
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,240
so you've done all this work you

1080
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,000
listened to all of rose's lessons

1081
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,440
learned and you took those back

1082
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,160
and you did all the hard work don't let

1083
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,119
your hard work

1084
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,320
be in vain make sure that you

1085
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,760
put a bow on all your hard work

1086
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,800
so what i mean by that is create this

1087
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,359
nice

1088
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,839
package of things for your auditor for

1089
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,200
your program

1090
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,079
and chicken tile and make them beautiful

1091
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,000
whatever you want to call it beautiful

1092
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
just put a bow on it make it this nice

1093
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,119
package

1094
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,520
make it something worth presenting don't

1095
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,160
let all that hard work go to waste

1096
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
um so make sure that you've taken time

1097
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,440
so

1098
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,560
um what i mean by here is

1099
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,400
have your audit artifacts for your

1100
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,680
non-deformities

1101
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,240
know your risks have all the components

1102
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,079
that you needed for your risk assessment

1103
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,720
have all these things tied together and

1104
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,400
know how they work together

1105
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,040
so take and tie the things build a

1106
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,920
manual

1107
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,880
um your isms manual is going to be

1108
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,960
essentially your one stop shop for all

1109
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,079
of your things

1110
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,200
we're gonna i'm gonna show you an

1111
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,599
example of that in the manual area

1112
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,200
then we have continuous improvement um

1113
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,400
don't let your hard work be in vain

1114
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,880
by not ensuring your continuous

1115
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,520
improvement

1116
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,000
is happening um if you implement your

1117
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
iso 27001 program appropriately

1118
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
or in accordance with clauses four

1119
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
through ten

1120
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,560
you have no choice but to continuous

1121
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,280
improve

1122
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,599
so make sure that you do that and that

1123
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,280
you are

1124
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,560
constantly seeking that next maturity

1125
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,520
level

1126
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,720
um and then audit prep so i got you this

1127
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
part got you the lessons learned got you

1128
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,920
all these things that make sure you

1129
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,200
don't forget and there's tons

1130
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,000
more that i didn't include here audit

1131
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,480
prep

1132
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,359
is super important don't forget this

1133
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,800
part

1134
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,160
so manual this is your repository of all

1135
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,280
of your things you did

1136
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,640
through the year um that pulled together

1137
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,079
your isms

1138
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,079
um and you use your manual to take

1139
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,440
entire evidence

1140
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,079
now a huge disclaimer here it does not

1141
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,760
need to be

1142
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
folders like this i'm just showing you a

1143
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,800
structure

1144
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
it can be in any repository that you

1145
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
want so common theme here

1146
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,000
is leverage what you have available to

1147
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,320
you

1148
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,520
while not creating unnecessary processes

1149
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,000
so leverage whatever repository that you

1150
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,800
want just

1151
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,160
have this stuff together it's going to

1152
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,839
make your life so much easier when

1153
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:42,800
you're trying to go through

1154
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,400
audits and things like that all right

1155
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,920
audit prep i

1156
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,800
went through my very first audit i was

1157
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,079
so nervous

1158
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,320
i didn't know what to expect and i got

1159
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,079
out the other side of it and it was like

1160
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,480
a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder

1161
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,040
and i thought to myself man what would

1162
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,160
have made my life

1163
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,880
easier you know what made my life easier

1164
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,000
all these prep

1165
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,599
things that i'm about to give you guys i

1166
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,119
wish i would have known

1167
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,079
so um first things first select your

1168
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:14,800
auditor

1169
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,640
make sure that you are selecting a

1170
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,880
reputable auditor you do some research

1171
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
on it because this is going to be the

1172
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,839
team that's auditing you

1173
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,440
so make sure you do your due diligence

1174
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,119
here and figure out who you want to be

1175
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,160
doing it

1176
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,920
uh know the technology that's going to

1177
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,760
be used for the audit

1178
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,680
with the pandemic a lot of things have

1179
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,040
been virtual

1180
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,760
or you know hybrid so just make sure

1181
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
that you understand the technology that

1182
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,599
you have the kinks worked out in advance

1183
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,680
it seems like such a small thing but the

1184
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,520
technology really can stress people out

1185
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,880
the day of the audit

1186
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,079
and we want to reduce stress to our

1187
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,920
counterparts the best that we can when

1188
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,520
we're going into this audit

1189
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,000
um so just make sure you understand that

1190
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,280
create a checklist

1191
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,800
so um this is probably

1192
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,720
the thing that i use the most i started

1193
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,319
getting ready for an audit

1194
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,960
um i understand all the different things

1195
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,319
that we have to do what are the

1196
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,440
mandatory things

1197
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,280
what are we you know what are the not

1198
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,960
mandatory things but they're used to

1199
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,280
support other items

1200
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,119
have your list together because what

1201
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,319
you're going to do with that list is

1202
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,520
you're going to get all of your things

1203
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,960
together you're going to assign it to

1204
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,000
people and do all those

1205
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
activities but then you're going to have

1206
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
a prep session with your main

1207
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,880
stakeholders and what i mean by main

1208
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,079
stakeholders

1209
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,359
is people that own processes

1210
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,640
that are critical

1211
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,800
to your isms so um maybe your cso

1212
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,160
or maybe your drc lead

1213
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,839
or the person that runs vulnerability

1214
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,920
any of those type of people um that you

1215
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,680
consider the name stakeholder and what

1216
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,560
you're going to do

1217
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,079
you're going to sit down and go through

1218
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,520
that checklist that you just spent

1219
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:51,920
months

1220
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,839
getting together taking and trying and

1221
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,280
doing all that work

1222
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,960
and as a group you're going to review

1223
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,440
all the evidence and get everybody on

1224
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
the same page because what you don't

1225
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,960
want to happen is you go into your audit

1226
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,560
everybody's on different pages you don't

1227
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,480
know what's going on so

1228
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,319
uh make sure you have that prep session

1229
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,720
i generally do it for eight hours

1230
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,560
um i promise you people are not

1231
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,319
miserable i keep the time up

1232
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,640
we build them rates um but everybody

1233
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,720
gets on the same page and we do it about

1234
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,319
three weeks ahead of the audit

1235
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,319
and it allows us time to go back and

1236
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,440
like hey

1237
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,599
that's a that's a gap you have a

1238
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,880
misspelling you have this

1239
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,520
it's like a mini qa session so um keep

1240
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
that in mind

1241
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
now taking it a step further prep the

1242
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,319
oddities

1243
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,200
so anybody that is on hook to get

1244
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,160
interviewed

1245
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,920
please make sure that you sit down with

1246
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,520
these people you

1247
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,400
tell them what to expect what to not say

1248
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,680
what to say

1249
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,240
how much is too much wordings and things

1250
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,960
like that

1251
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
and give them the confidence that they

1252
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
need to go into these audits

1253
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,640
i promise you you will be very happy

1254
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,000
that you did that because not

1255
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,839
only are you going to reduce their

1256
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,400
stress and their anxiety

1257
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,920
you're going to be more willing to do it

1258
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,839
in the future and your audits generally

1259
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:06,800
going to go better

1260
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,319
so make sure that you talk with them and

1261
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,319
you get them ready for their audit

1262
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,400
um and then last piece of advice i have

1263
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,880
here is set up a private chat

1264
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,920
during your audit and um leverage it

1265
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,640
to have offline communications regarding

1266
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
things that need to be

1267
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,599
um displayed to the auditor or

1268
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,520
things that you need to tell the auditor

1269
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,720
or things that you don't want to tell

1270
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,520
the auditor

1271
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,280
and this allows you to have private

1272
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,560
dialogue going on

1273
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,040
during your audit um and that not

1274
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,520
everything's happening in a black hole

1275
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,119
so um just some tips there and that's um

1276
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,800
audit prep so that's it

1277
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,200
that is my crash course and all the

1278
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,160
things that i learned

1279
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,240
i definitely think i'm missing some

1280
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,359
things here

1281
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,319
um because it's a very large program to

1282
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,000
implement there's a lot of ins and outs

1283
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,040
to it

1284
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,640
um so i have my wrap up here

1285
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,520
um because there's just so much to cover

1286
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,200
and i didn't have it all in here

1287
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,880
if you have any questions about what i

1288
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,720

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,319
