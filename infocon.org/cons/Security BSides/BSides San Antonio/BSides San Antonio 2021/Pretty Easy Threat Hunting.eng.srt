maybe on discord there

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
i think he said it's about a 10-15

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,280
second delay so

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,040
all right good to go

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,320
all right guys i appreciate it

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
um today um i was just you know

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
you know talking to the the organizers

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,559
that you know hey the

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,320
this talk is usually kind of a longer

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
talk uh so i've i've drilled it down to

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,360
really just a

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,480
high level summary of how to use some

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,760
basic concepts

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,799
um i think you all probably read the the

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
uh the quick summary abstract

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,520
but as you can imagine in 20 25 minutes

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,200
it's very difficult to go into any

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,560
detail

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
around you know some of the concepts

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,759
when it comes to threat hunting

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,479
so you know today is really meant to be

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:18,880
a

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,600
just kind of intro into you know how you

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,040
can leverage some of these

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
frameworks and stuff but you know

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,880
definitely feel free to reach out after

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,560
this i love to

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
i love to talk about this stuff so if

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,640
you want to see any more examples or

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
talk you know deeper around the subject

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
you know please let me know

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
so to start off um you know i'm nick

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,840
sweet

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,799
uh i lead our solutions architecture uh

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,280
team

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
at a company called avertium uh we're a

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,079
cyber security consulting firm that also

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,560
does

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
manage security services i've been there

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,240
for a few years

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,399
i actually led our managed security

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,759
practice where a lot of our threat

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,399
hunting

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,040
and stuff uh actually comes out of uh so

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,479
that's where a lot of the things that

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,759
you're gonna see today

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,520
uh where the where the topics come from

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,719
some of the things that we meet with our

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
customers on a day-to-day basis about

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
these are the concepts and things when

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
we're working with them to build out

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,160
you know a really mature and capable

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
threat hunting program what are the

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
things that they need to be looking at

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
and not just looking at it necessarily

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
from the the very technical

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,239
tactical standpoint but also from a from

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,160
a program level standpoint

69
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,200
and i think you know that is where

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
if you i'm sure if you guys are aware of

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,080
threat hunting i'm sure you've seen a

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,480
lot of the great work that you know like

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,040
you know the

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
cyber war dog and some of the things

75
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
that he's done around you know the

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,239
through threat notebooks and

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,239
and help and a lot of that this is

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,840
really meant to take it up a level

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,519
because i think there's a lot of great

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
stuff that's happened in the industry

81
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,280
around you know the technical pieces

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,640
from atomic red

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,280
team testing to you know all of those

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,959
sort of you know very tactical using

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,080
things like

86
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
uh you know sigma rules and stuff for

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
sim detection

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,720
so today's really is how do you take

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
that information show value

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
and what's what's important about that

91
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
is you know if you think about it you

92
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,360
know this audience

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,599
who the audience is for this is really

94
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,480
for

95
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,800
the maybe the leader of this you know

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
cyber threat intelligence group or

97
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,920
the leader of a threat team

98
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
as you know you're when you're trying to

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
figure out what type of value are we

100
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
showing in the organization

101
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
um just like with anything it can be i t

102
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
it could be you know

103
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,319
the sim like what values the sim

104
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,040
providing what value is your edr

105
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
providing like you have to have metrics

106
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,159
you have to have reporting

107
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
and you have to have some way to tie

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,920
this back to the business

109
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,400
um so today hopefully you know since

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,920
this is only a 20 minute talk it has to

111
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200
be high level

112
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,799
i do like i said i do more technical

113
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,959
talks um but i will there will be some

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,640
technical excerpts in here that you'll

115
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
be able to see around

116
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,879
how to leverage that so quick outline

117
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,599
you know so

118
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
quick history intro that's kind of what

119
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,879
we're doing now um

120
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,120
you know how do we you know clean up our

121
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,040
thread hunt reports you know and

122
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,959
why is that important uh you know what

123
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,480
are notebooks and you know how are they

124
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
helpful

125
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
um what and how do we use those

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,959
internally in a verdium to do that

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,239
you know it could be different for you

128
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,319
guys if this is an internal type

129
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,959
of threat hunting program but as you can

130
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
imagine you know we have hundreds of

131
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
customers that we monitor on a daily

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
basis so we have to have like a pipeline

133
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
and a way to operationalize this so

134
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
hopefully you'll be able to get

135
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
you know some quick you know kind of

136
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
pointers recommendations or

137
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
maybe a new unique way of thinking about

138
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
how you can operationalize your thread

139
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
hunting within your organization

140
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,080
okay so starting at the top right

141
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
so for us you know we we like to look at

142
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840
everything as a you know some type of

143
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
maturity model some type of way of

144
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
measuring success

145
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
and you know what we're going to be

146
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,080
talking about today is really on the

147
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,919
higher level of how are you

148
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,080
you know optimizing and quantize you

149
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,840
know think about how are you managing

150
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,720
the day-to-day

151
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
operations within your threat programs

152
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
you know you could be today in the

153
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,560
initial stage where it's just kind of ad

154
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,199
hoc

155
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,759
routine type of threat hunts but you can

156
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
still even in those early stages put

157
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
some polish to that

158
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,880
so the whole talk to this right about

159
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,639
being pretty and easy

160
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,320
right is that's what this is meant to do

161
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,199
is to even if you're in an initial phase

162
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,320
you're just starting to build that

163
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
program out

164
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,759
is just taking that extra five minutes

165
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,520
to put a little bit of polish on that so

166
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,000
that when you're

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,919
doing the threat hunts within your

168
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,919
environment that you already have

169
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,520
pre-built templates you already have

170
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,120
pre-built ways that you're going to be

171
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,400
taking these reports

172
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
handing it off to management to show

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
what you're doing on a day-to-day basis

174
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
so starting at the beginning you know

175
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
all of this is going to be built around

176
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
you know a lot of great

177
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
um things are out there today right so

178
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
we know about moderate attack

179
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,759
uh miter shield this could be kpec you

180
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,199
know there's a lot of good things out

181
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,720
there around you know what are the bad

182
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
guys doing this could be threat

183
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,080
advisories that you're getting from the

184
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
nsa fbi or seaside or

185
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
or you know talos or any of these other

186
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
great groups out there that are

187
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
releasing

188
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
uh threat reports it's like how do we

189
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,000
take that information

190
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,280
and then build that pipeline and then

191
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
it's like taking that that routine

192
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
threat hunt process

193
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
and you know i'm sure you've seen some

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
type of example of this this is just you

195
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
know a high level

196
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
you know kind of what does a typical

197
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
threat hunt look like and this is the

198
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,680
operational kind of

199
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
the the the actual threat hunter

200
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
themself the tactician that's in the

201
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,560
weeds doing this you're like

202
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
what do they have to do you know

203
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
collecting that data formulating those

204
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
hypotheses

205
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,560
how do they perform those hunts on a

206
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,000
day-to-day basis

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
and then how do we refine those

208
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,039
detections

209
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
find the actual you know threats that

210
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,560
are in that environment

211
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
and then how do we triage and remediate

212
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
that so

213
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
this is kind of where i think most

214
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,919
people stop and so what today i want to

215
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,360
challenge is is how do we

216
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
take that a step further so not just

217
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
doing the threat hunt just

218
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,080
doing it opening a ticket up with maybe

219
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
the sysadmin or the web app

220
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,599
team or you know the dev ops team to go

221
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,120
in and you know remediate whatever you

222
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,080
might find but

223
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
putting some polish to that so then

224
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
instead of just sending over some raw

225
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,800
text or screenshot can i operationalize

226
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,639
that to show intelligence through the

227
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,039
entire organization

228
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,120
and so this is where jupiter notebooks

229
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,400
comes in for us um

230
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,759
i don't know how many of y'all have used

231
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,840
jupiter notebooks uh this is one of the

232
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,440
things that you see a lot of times in

233
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
like data science communities

234
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
i know a lot of people in security use

235
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,479
them um

236
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,319
a lot of you know just in science in

237
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,000
general a way to

238
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,039
you know come up with you know templated

239
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,440
ways of doing analysis over data sets

240
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,560
and everything else

241
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,319
and what's really good about these is

242
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
once you build them once you can almost

243
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
build them in templates

244
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
so you can make them that you know doing

245
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,879
them right the first time you're able to

246
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,919
make them pretty

247
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,319
put pretty graphics put those beautiful

248
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,759
charts in there some of the things we'll

249
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,879
show here in a little bit

250
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,479
that allows you to when you do those

251
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,680
threat hunts instead of it just being a

252
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
one-time and done thing it's actually

253
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,080
something that you can take and use

254
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,240
again later right and we'll talk about

255
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,360
how you do that

256
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,599
in just a second all right so

257
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,440
so why not make them pretty right you

258
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,039
know first off you know for me

259
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,840
it's a pretty easy way of you know

260
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
getting information out within the

261
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
organization

262
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,919
and if you think about threat

263
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,599
intelligence you know we i want to look

264
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,360
at it at kind of the higher level

265
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,919
right you know a threat hunt is only a

266
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,120
part of

267
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
a larger threat intelligence program

268
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
right you have threat intelligence

269
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,519
coming in this could be ttps from minor

270
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,679
ttps from you know threat intelligence

271
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
reports it could be

272
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,559
some a list of iocs from a

273
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,159
threat feed that you might have from

274
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
some type of data feed provider

275
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
and it's like how do you take all that

276
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,600
information and then put it into a

277
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
report so what you'll start seeing in

278
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
here on the right here on on these

279
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,600
slides

280
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,080
are some examples of how we've taken

281
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,720
that

282
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
and actually turned it into a pretty

283
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,880
deliverable

284
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,360
so you're still doing the the day-to-day

285
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,240
threat hunting

286
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
but by using notebooks and stuff like

287
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
this you pre-build these have these

288
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
already

289
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
there so you can hand them out to your

290
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,800
you know level three analysts your

291
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
threat intelligence team

292
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
and then they can go in and actually

293
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
just use these notebooks over and over

294
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,640
again

295
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
and it just gives you a really nice

296
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
deliverable so that you know

297
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
you're actually showing the value to

298
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
your team and this is really important

299
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
for

300
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
managers of socks or sock directors or

301
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,240
cso's or whatever

302
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
anybody else is like as you're trying to

303
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,160
show value with your team

304
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
you're the threat analyst probably

305
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,360
doesn't care too much about that they

306
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,640
might just want to do

307
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,800
the they just say i don't want the fluff

308
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
i just want to do the hunt like i want

309
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,040
to get in there

310
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,760
i want to fight the bad guys but we all

311
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,279
know if you can't show the value that

312
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
you're doing on a day-to-day basis

313
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
a lot of that can be lost so that we use

314
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
this as a tool for our customers to be

315
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,800
able to show value

316
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
right is just saying yes we're doing

317
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,399
threat hunting is one thing

318
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,920
but they want to see something pretty on

319
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
the other end of that right just saying

320
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,839
hey we found this ip address in your

321
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,360
computer and it looked bad

322
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,279
it's just not a really good thing so

323
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,959
what we try to do is just put

324
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,640
some intelligence behind it where did

325
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,240
that ioc come from

326
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
did it come from a threat fee did it

327
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
come from a threat intel report that we

328
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,800
looked at

329
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
and then we give them a nice deliverable

330
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,000
that then they can take and then

331
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,560
actually

332
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,240
hand it up to their leadership to show

333
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,920
that value on a day-to-day basis

334
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,360
so moving on here so i know we got about

335
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,959
nine more minutes here

336
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
is you like first off the grass and

337
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,000
charts so within

338
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
notebooks there's a lot of great things

339
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
that you can do

340
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
directly in that so once you establish

341
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,240
that pdf establish that structure

342
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,839
being able to have you know i gave you a

343
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,440
couple screenshots here

344
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,760
of having kind of the raw queries the

345
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,279
raw things for the technical

346
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,720
group and the crowd and then you can

347
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
have kind of the graphs that shows you

348
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,880
know

349
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
what did you see when you were doing

350
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,079
that threat hunt when you're doing that

351
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,560
analysis did you see any powershell

352
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
um you know what browsers if you were

353
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
doing say maybe you got brought in to do

354
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,839
a threat hunt against some type of

355
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,800
application

356
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,480
because you saw maybe something weird

357
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
was going on being able to look through

358
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
that data see what's being

359
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,160
seen there and then be able to see what

360
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,000
i p addresses are there

361
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,079
and being able to really show you what's

362
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,920
actually in there

363
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,519
and then be able to relate that back to

364
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,120
the business and you'll start seeing

365
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,480
here in just a second these

366
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,120
independent screenshots actually get

367
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,880
built into kind of modules

368
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
and i've given a little bit of a

369
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,680
framework that you all can use and maybe

370
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,440
take a screenshot of here in just a

371
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,000
second

372
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
that you can take in and kind of maybe

373
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
build from but then taking that data and

374
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,880
relating it back to the business

375
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,640
right so when you do that threat hunt

376
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
and it was some type maybe you read

377
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
you know the whole colonial attack and

378
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
you know dark side and all the tactics

379
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,880
and techniques

380
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,120
that were used there is all right you

381
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
know instead of me just sending over

382
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,839
that hey we saw x in your environment

383
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,800
it's like hey we saw

384
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,480
x and this is a ioc or a ttp

385
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,360
that's seen in these particular apt

386
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,959
groups so being able to take that and

387
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,639
put in context around that

388
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,160
and then be able to layer that

389
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,519
information into a story which is really

390
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,959
important right is

391
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,360
is is being able to say what's the why

392
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,639
or the so what

393
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,240
it's like why is that important it's

394
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,079
like hey i know you guys are doing these

395
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,680
great threat hunts day in and day out

396
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,279
but you know why is that important like

397
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,639
why should a ceo

398
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,279
why should a cfo or an executive or a

399
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,720
board member really worry about those

400
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,399
sort of things so

401
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
this gives you all the ability as like

402
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
threat hunters or sock analysts to

403
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
really be able to take you from that

404
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,399
that very traditional just in the weeds

405
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,440
type of person

406
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
and now elevating your skill sets and

407
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,480
elevating the things that are happening

408
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,959
in your

409
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,040
in the environment and really relating

410
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,399
this to business risk within the

411
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,200
environment

412
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
and you would be surprised what type of

413
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
funding people get when they do this

414
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,519
type of thing

415
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,200
because just sending over hey i did a

416
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
threat hunt last week

417
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
doesn't show the value if you start

418
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
doing these sort of things it really

419
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,000
helps you tell a good story

420
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,519
and the next time you're going for that

421
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,200
budget ask it's like oh hey you remember

422
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,880
those five or six reports that we sent

423
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,440
over

424
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
well that's why we need to make this

425
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,279
investment within this particular area

426
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
within our company

427
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
all right and here starting with you

428
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,519
know kind of this is a just a quick

429
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:11,920
little

430
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,519
high level thing that what we usually

431
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,079
put within our our modular approach to

432
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,279
our threat reports

433
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,959
and there's usually a pipeline to this

434
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,240
and you know and i'll actually show you

435
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
some examples on the next few screens

436
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
here is you know like what do you

437
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,519
actually put into this

438
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,720
so the having the you know kind of the

439
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
important pieces up front right so

440
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
the document info you know what where

441
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,959
did when was the report done you know

442
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,320
when was it prepared

443
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
when did you did you do a hunt when was

444
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,079
the hunt you know done

445
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,600
and with these you know as you build

446
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,279
these what you come to find out is these

447
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:43,920
hunts

448
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
is they can actually be done multiple

449
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
times right as you know a lot of the

450
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,199
ttps

451
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,120
get borrowed across you know different

452
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,639
threat reports you know if people are

453
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,440
using

454
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,199
power shell or living off the land

455
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,360
techniques that's just not one threat

456
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,000
group

457
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,399
you know your those ttps you build those

458
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,000
notebooks you build those thread hunts

459
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,240
one time and all of a sudden you're

460
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,760
actually able to pull in

461
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
work that you've done in the past you're

462
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,199
just relating it now to a new

463
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,600
ttp or a new threat group or whatever

464
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,399
else

465
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,839
so starting at the top having that

466
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,360
document info talking about the

467
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,480
objective of this

468
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
having an abstract of what you're

469
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,079
looking for what data did you use

470
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,800
do you have a sim do you have an edr uh

471
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
maybe you just have a

472
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,160
a syslog box that you're sitting sending

473
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,279
logs to right

474
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,120
there's nothing wrong with that you know

475
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,199
so being able to go and look at that

476
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,560
data on those systems

477
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,839
and then actually be able to run those

478
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,720
queries then actually having the context

479
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,920
around you know hey the threat

480
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,279
information itself

481
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,800
you know having that summary that you

482
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
saw about the dark side having those

483
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,000
tactics and techniques and the

484
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,279
procedures that are there

485
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,199
what recommendations or references do

486
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,320
you have to that

487
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,839
and then what you see here now is you're

488
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
building this nice

489
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,519
playbook that you can use over and over

490
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,800
again and just

491
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
show you a few examples here i know we

492
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,480
got about five minutes before we'll open

493
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,839
this up to questions

494
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,480
is here's an example of that right so if

495
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
you are familiar with jupiter

496
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,279
like these are things that you can

497
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
pre-build in there so that when you hand

498
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
and you build these templates off your

499
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,000
threat you know your analysts or

500
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,560
whatever

501
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
know what information they need to put

502
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
in here what if the objective is

503
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
i need to put the date in because i'm

504
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,839
doing this today then the next section

505
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,240
is

506
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
hey that that contextual information we

507
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,399
were talking about so having that dark

508
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,040
side

509
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,800
thread intelligence report in there that

510
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
says this is why we're doing this threat

511
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,120
hunt

512
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,519
and why it's important then being able

513
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,240
to show you know

514
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
what what were those recommendations

515
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,079
what are the mappings to miter attack

516
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,759
that we're doing as part of this threat

517
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,399
hunt

518
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,959
and then actually going in and doing the

519
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,720
actual threat hunt itself against that

520
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,199
data

521
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,720
right so here are some rough examples

522
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,320
right you know hey i have some

523
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,160
power shell that i'm looking for within

524
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,519
this environment because i know these

525
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,959
are the own iocs

526
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,480
how many of these are threats how many

527
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,639
of these are benign this is actually an

528
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,720
example of an mlai engine that we

529
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,199
developed that helps with some of this

530
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,800
then it's like you know hey going back

531
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
to the apache log thing and say

532
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,839
you know what we don't have our

533
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,680
application logs going to our sam or

534
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
anywhere just because you know

535
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,120
hey we can't afford to pay the mps or

536
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,199
the log ingestion or whatever that is to

537
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,880
a security company to do that

538
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,959
but what if an incident happens or you

539
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,560
need to go and look at those logs you

540
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
can use these notebooks also in those

541
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,519
dfir

542
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,839
type of engagements to where hey just

543
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,160
hand me over those you know apache logs

544
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,519
i'll be able to throw this in here i'll

545
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,360
be able to parse that data and get the

546
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,000
information back to be able to do that

547
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
and then the final piece is be able to

548
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
do kind of a heat map against mitre and

549
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,079
the ttps that you found in that

550
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
to show risk to the organization so i

551
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
don't know if you all have a way to do

552
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
risk ratings against modern attack and

553
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,920
that sort of thing but

554
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,680
there's ways that you can take that and

555
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920
say hey if one of the ways for initial

556
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
access that this ttp group

557
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
or this apt group uses is say drive by

558
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,040
compromise or

559
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
maybe you like to use spear phishing is

560
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,959
what's our risk to that so establishing

561
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,480
initial risk around

562
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,800
you know hey do we have the appropriate

563
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,320
email protections in place are we

564
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
training our users

565
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,400
do we have any detections in place for

566
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
that can we

567
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,439
you know do we have a sam do we have edr

568
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,400
to help us that

569
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
what's our response look like do we have

570
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,319
an instant response plan do we have

571
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,599
the appropriate people and staff to

572
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,439
help us when an incident happens so do

573
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,359
we have a dfr retainer that we can pull

574
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,079
that in

575
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,559
and as you go across this be able to map

576
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,480
this back to a threat group

577
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
if you know that certain threat groups

578
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,559
like to hit your vertical or your

579
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,520
industry

580
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,960
is if these particular ttps get used

581
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
more in those particular groups

582
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,760
maybe we should do a little

583
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
multiplication on that let's double that

584
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,480
and say hey if if it's anybody else it's

585
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
a one but because we know a threat group

586
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
uses that

587
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
maybe that's a let's double that score

588
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
and give us a higher residual risk score

589
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,600
and then it allows us then to layer that

590
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,760
into that report that we send up to the

591
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
organization

592
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,760
or the executives within your company

593
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
and now they can see it's like all right

594
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
here's all this technical information

595
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
god thanks guys for doing that hunt

596
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,320
looks like we're good we didn't see

597
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,120
anything

598
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,200
and also during that we actually did a

599
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,360
heat map overlay to see how well we're

600
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,799
protected against those

601
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,240
so instead of just having that very

602
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,400
tactical piece you're also throwing in

603
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,919
a program level piece of this as well

604
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
and then ultimately by doing this you

605
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,600
get a kind of a build it once rinse and

606
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,240
repeat

607
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,679
type of approach and what you're kind of

608
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,919
seeing here is really that pipeline

609
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,720
so you know your your cti group your

610
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,919
cyber threat intelligence team

611
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,280
identifies a threat

612
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,799
they create that threat intelligence

613
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,600
report it gets hand off to the actual

614
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,679
threat hunters or the analysts

615
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,160
they take the notebooks from your

616
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
catalog

617
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,799
of you know all the ones that you've

618
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
built so maybe it's one to

619
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
look for powershell commands maybe it's

620
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,480
one for you know trying to look for

621
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
golden tickets within your environment

622
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,080
whatever those are

623
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,200
you know they can take those because you

624
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
already have them built it's just now

625
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
pointing at the data

626
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,320
then you provide that threat report you

627
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,240
sandwich it together now the executives

628
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,520
within the organization

629
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
have a nice report that they can look

630
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,960
through they can see the business

631
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
context to it they get the technical

632
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,160
information if they need it

633
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
and it builds something as it moves up

634
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,600
through the organization

635
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
each person has the information they

636
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
need for the decisions they have to make

637
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,360
within the organization

638
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,160
so that i think is up at our 20 minutes

639
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,000
so i think the timing worked out there

640
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,120
so i will

641
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,840
take questions now

642
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,919
thank you very much nick that was a

643
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,360
great presentation

644
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,880
you've given us some really great ideas

645
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,280
on how to translate technical data into

646
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
something that the c-suite can really

647
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,320
use

648
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
um currently i'm not seeing any

649
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,360
questions on

650
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,480
crowdcast or on discord if you have any

651
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,080
questions right now please feel free to

652
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,880
type those in

653
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,679
so we can get those answered by nick and

654
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,520
if you can't think of them right now but

655
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
they're coming up soon

656
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
feel free to bring that up in the

657
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,039
discord channel

658
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,600
track 2 breakout and we have a few

659
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,360
people typing so we might get a couple

660
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,000
of questions

661
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,039
here perfect yeah i guess like i said

662
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,640
this was a 20-minute talk this just

663
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,000
introduces the topic

664
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,720
um if any interest definitely reach out

665
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,600
because you know

666
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
the the notebooks you know that that's

667
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,120
where a lot of this you know really

668
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,559
gets made so you have any additional

669
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,000
questions you know feel free to reach

670
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
out

671
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
what does that structure look like what

672
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,720
does a final report look like when it's

673
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,280
done

674
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
you'll be glad to kind of show you you

675
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,480
know what that can really look like

676
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,720
within your organization

677
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,159
we do have one question there in the

678
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,000
discord um

679
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
the question is do you make a miter

680
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,320
attack navigator json layer for

681
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,679
detections for the heat map yeah so

682
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,360
that's what we have internally that we

683
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,679
use

684
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,320
so we have we use kind of a json output

685
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,440
of that you know just like you know the

686
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
navigator that you see online

687
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,440
that you know kind of gets layered into

688
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,960
this so that is an internal tool

689
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
so when we're going through and doing

690
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,440
these reports we're able to you know

691
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
click in there and say these are

692
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
you know the ttps that we want and then

693
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,240
we know the notebooks that are

694
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
associated with those

695
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
which allows us then to go to the data

696
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,879
sources to be able to pull that out

697
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,919
excellent yeah i thought that matrix was

698
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,880
really really

699
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,799
beneficial something that i never i

700
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,760
never considered doing myself

701
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,158
okay

702
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,559
got a question there can you show us the

703
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,960
final report looks like

704
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,039
based on the notebook oh i don't have a

705
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,159
cleaned up one

706
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,080
uh like i can definitely sanitize one um

707
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,120
if if that'd be something that the you

708
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:44,159
know people would like to see

709
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,320
you've got you got pictures of that as

710
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,440
well so there was

711
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,120
so some of those those were actually

712
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
screen shots out of those final reports

713
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,840
so

714
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
uh just as you were going through there

715
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,360
what i did is i just try to

716
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,440
show those in one slide uh just to get

717
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
them into a powerpoint

718
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,799
and we can definitely share the slides

719
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,159
awesome they'll also be a copy of these

720
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,919
videos uploaded you'll probably be able

721
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,520
to follow that on

722
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,679
any of the b-side social media they'll

723
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,600
release a link whenever all these

724
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,760
sessions are available to be viewed

725
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,280
and there's some other great tools you

726
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,960
know like i think it doesn't really

727
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,080
they don't use it as much anymore but

728
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,640
there's

729
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,799
the nsa has a great project out there as

730
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,400
well that can do a lot of the

731
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,760
heat mapping and stuff as well

732
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,760
so i think we're we've got two minutes

733
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
yep i think we don't have any more

734
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,679
questions so we can go ahead and

735
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,360
give some people a little bit of extra

736
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,200
