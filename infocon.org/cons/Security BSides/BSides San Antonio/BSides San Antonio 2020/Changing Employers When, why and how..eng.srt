or for that matter just about anywhere

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,239
you're a target

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,680
the more information you put out there

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
on linkedin and everywhere else about

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,160
where you

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,320
are and where you work the easier it is

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,360
for someone to

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,719
do something to get into well you

28
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,480
um they can find out about you your

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
hobbies your habits

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
and uh find that exact lure that's going

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,079
to catch you in a fish

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,640
so um because of that i put security

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,359
janitor

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,799
um i uh i work with a security team

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,920
uh and it's they're great people

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
but it's i haven't been there that long

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,520
so

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,560
changing employers for over 20 and a

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
half years i did work

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,479
at broadway national bank um so

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,759
and around february i changed and i went

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,000
to

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
another financial institution here in

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,280
town and uh

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,040
it was a very good move for me and

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,439
i get so many questions why why would

47
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,880
you leave broadway after

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,720
over two decades of work and it

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
there are a lot of answers to that right

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,799
and it really depends on

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,640
point of view and what's going on did

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
did i leave broadway bank or did i

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
go to this new place that i was working

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
at and for the most part

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
i was going to the new place that i'm

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
working at there were some things that

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,759
were going on that at the

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,640
office like most any office uh if you've

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,119
been there

60
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,799
two decades or even two years

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,880
that is happening that would make you

62
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
want to maybe

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
i should find another job but maybe i'm

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
not going to go and actively

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,520
go do that but the opportunity that i

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
was provided

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
it was beyond par so that's kind of why

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,360
was the primary reason that i that i

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,840
left

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,599
and we're going to kind of go over uh

71
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,319
those kind of decision makings and stuff

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560

at an institution like that um

111
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,159
well i didn't have this problem but a

112
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,439
lot of people do

113
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,120
that sunday night dread is this like

114
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
you know i really don't want to wake up

115
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,239
in the morning

116
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,000
or drag myself to that job those are

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
common common problems and if you're

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
having a lot of that

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
and it might be time to to move on

120
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,799
yeah you can't be yourself you have to

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
be somebody else you can't uh interact

122
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,959
the way you want to interact with

123
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,839
people um

124
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,919
that could also be a problem um

125
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
i recently um saw a wonderful

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
um three speaker event in february

127
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,479
before

128
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,880
all events were really shut down all

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,160
three of the speaker were

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,600
prominent uh uh in their field and

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
all of them had uh had different types

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,680
of harassment

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
uh against them over the years

134
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,240
um primarily because they were female

135
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,080
you know it's sad to think that that uh

136
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
they couldn't uh you know be themselves

137
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,479
and they had to

138
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,759
you know take terrible

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,759
conversations with these people that she

140
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,280
would they were working with

141
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,039
um and almost all of them had a story

142
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,639
like that so

143
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
if you can't be yourself at your

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
position for whatever reason whether

145
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,120
it's

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
harassment or whatever

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,199
so that might be another good reason to

148
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,000
go out

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,440
no advancement um and this is a real big

150
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,160
deal for

151
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
a lot of people um i like

152
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
doing interesting things as long i'm

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
doing interesting things generally

154
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,759
advancement is not one of my big goals

155
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,759
i'm not ever looking to become a cio i'm

156
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,199
not ever looking to become a

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,600
cso really or anything like that i'm i

158
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
like doing

159
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,080
you know the day in day out work of

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
security blue team type type stuff

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
that's that's my bread and butter

162
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,039
and that's what i really enjoy so

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,520
for me you know that i'm not going to be

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,160
a

165
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
you know a cso someday or cio or

166
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
whatever that that's never really been a

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,800
big impetus

168
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,039
for for me personally but there are many

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,080
people out there

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,160
those are the goals that they have and

171
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
and they're very achievable by the way

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
as well

173
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,520
yeah no more joy so

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,199
it's almost like the saturday sunday

175
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,560
night dread right

176
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,840
no more joy in in in in your work

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
you just everything is just drudgery

178
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,960
it's

179
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,160
you know office space times 10.

180
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,120
so you get to that point yeah you really

181
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,759
need to

182
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,120
uh to consider uh finding another

183
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
position unstable workplace

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,880
you know management's changed three

185
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
times in five years and

186
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,560
everybody started new initiatives and

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
nobody's completed anything

188
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
and or you have other things going on

189
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
maybe some people are you know buyouts

190
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,120
or going public or not going public or

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
there's all kinds of different stability

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,880
issues in in the workplace

193
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
um maybe they are you know having

194
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,919
issues with their own finances

195
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,160
internally to an organization

196
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
uh especially right now with covet 19

197
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,840
there's going to be so many

198
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
sadly so many different companies that

199
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
are going to be going out of business

200
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,080
and when that happens it's going to

201
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,000
leave a lot of people looking for more

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240

to network here in san antonio one of

245
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,399
them

246
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,519
is the alamo ise squared group all you

as the alamo issa they're going to be

260
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,160
switching

261
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
to monthly meetings instead of the big

262
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
quarterly meetings that they're they

263
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
were doing

264
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
um just because it fits better into

265
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,519
people's schedule

266
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,320

there if you're in your 20s

342
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,639
even 30s if you're not looking at

343
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
benefits especially

344
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,959
retirement benefits 401k pensions

345
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,440
then you really need to start focusing

346
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
on that

347
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
that is the time to start starting if

348
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
you're 35

349
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,079
or 40 even and now i'm gonna

350
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,519
think about retirement for the next 20

351
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,600
years

352
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
you're really losing out because of

353
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,320
things called compound interest right

354
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,360
without having a um an

355
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
active way to uh

356
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,519
can get to a point where you can retire

357
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,200
that's a that's a big deal

358
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,399
so i cannot stress enough uh

359
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,760
to think about

360
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,079
not just retirement benefits health

361
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,160
benefits how is their insurance who's

362
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,279
their insurance carrier

363
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,959
do they have other things educational

364
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,720
benefits what would they do if you

365
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
wanted to get a certification

366
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,000
would they pay for a test would they not

367
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,279
would they pay for a class would they

368
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,079
not

369
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,279
all of those types of things are big

370
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,320
deals

371
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,279
for jobs these days in some ways

372
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,560
benefits

373
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,680
even shine things like um pay in

374
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,360
in many regards time off

375
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
how is it accrued how is it built is it

376
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
lump sum is it you know pieces how do

377
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,760
you

378
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,079
how do you get that there don't be

379
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,920
afraid if you're talking to hr and

380
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
you're starting to get

381
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
into the process even before the

382
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,480
interview you can ask

383
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
questions like that how is this stuff

384
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,399
done

385
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,279
i truly recommend that they're usually

386
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,720
very open

387
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
with that kind of information because

388
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
they want to make sure culturally

389
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
you're going to fit with their

390
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,680
organization as well

391
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,880
now why not leave

392
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
why why why would you not leave an

393
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,000
organization

394
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
um and there are some really good good

395
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
examples of that

396
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,399
if you've been there 12 months or less

397
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
that doesn't look very good on a resume

398
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
um there there are times though that

399
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,440
that

400
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
that can be forgiven right uh in 2008

401
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,680
there was a

402
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,560
quite a bit of a recession going on in

403
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,000
economic hardship

404
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,279
it hit especially the industry areas of

405
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,600
the united states i looked at uh

406
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,800
somebody's resume

407
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
and it said they only had a job for nine

408
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,000
months and then another job for nine

409
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,440
months then it for four months and then

410
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,839
they

411
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,000
had another job for you know like 12

412
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,240
months all during that time period

413
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,000
and it was in detroit and it was um

414
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,199
so i'm like wow this person actually

415
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,279
found work in detroit in 2008 2009.

416
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,959
um they must be very very motivated and

417
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,040
very much a go-getter if they're

418
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
doing that and it was contract work they

419
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
were taking contract after contract to

420
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,720
to stay employed those kind of things

421
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,040
are

422
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,519
are easily explainable but for the most

423
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,199
part you really want to stay at least 12

424
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,199
months on the job

425
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,320
um there's another kind of caveat let's

426
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,880
say

427
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
um some benefit kicks in only after four

428
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,399
years or five years let's say a pension

429
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,160
or whatever that date should be marked

430
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,199
on your calendar

431
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,680
there should be no ambiguity in your

432
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
mind of when that date is

433
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,199
um and uh there was a time

434
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,639
a few years ago i was talking to

435
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,160
somebody they were very excited they had

436
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,519
a great opportunity they were going to

437
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,720
be leaving

438
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,079
broadway bank and going to that

439
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,399
opportunity and uh i said

440
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,560
you've been here almost five years right

441
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,440
and they said

442
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
yeah yeah it's really close but yeah and

443
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,480
i said

444
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,839
haslows and they were like

445
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,160
oh well they were planning on leaving on

446
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,440
a friday and their fifth year

447
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,399
anniversary was the next monday

448
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,000
that one day could cost them 20

449
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
of their um

450
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
401k matching money um

451
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
fortunately the organization was kind

452
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,720
and let them withdraw their resignation

453
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,800
and put it in for one more day

454
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,320
and then they talked to the organization

455
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
that they were going to they accepted

456
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,240
that

457
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,279
it was going to be a little bit

458
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
different of a day and everything worked

459
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
out very well for them

460
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,720
most organizations are not so kind so

461
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,000
once again know those dates put them on

462
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,720
calendars

463
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
don't don't you know uh

464
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
forget the the goal of what you're

465
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,440
trying to do

466
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,040
uh by you know doing things like uh 401k

467
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,160
matching money

468
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
and keeping it so when you go uh and

469
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,600
stuff

470
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
um that doesn't mean i think you should

471
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
leave at five years in one day

472
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,360
i'm just saying that you know if the the

473
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,680
job is tenable keep it up but

474
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
under 12 months does look a little

475
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
little sketchy

476
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,240
leadership change is on the way um this

477
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,199
can go either way

478
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,520
you know sometimes a leadership change

479
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,959
things go from

480
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,280
not so good to great and sometimes it

481
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,319
goes from

482
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,760
pretty good to not so great but

483
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,039
sometimes when there's a leadership

484
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,119
change you really want to get a handle

485
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,439
on

486
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,119
the new leaders and what they're what

487
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,119
they're doing whether it's

488
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,439
at the sea level the ceos and that kind

489
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,799
of thing

490
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,400
and that guidance and direction for your

491
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,200
organization or if it's the cio

492
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,679
or even cso if you're reporting on the

493
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,440
security side

494
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,000
um you know it makes a difference find

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,480
out

496
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,000
how the leadership change is going to

497
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
affect uh your work

498
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,600
and how things are going so yeah that's

499
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
that's why you'd probably want to stay

500
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,880
you really want to check out

501
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,320
what's happening down the way because

502
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,720
some of those frustrations that you had

503
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
they might just completely go away with

504
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,000
leadership changes

505
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,520
look for your a job while you're

506
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,080
employed and

507
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,320
this one's a big deal uh if you don't

508
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
look for a job while you're employed

509
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,600
you could um you know it it's harder all

510
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
the way around it

511
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,400
to find a job according to one statistic

512
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,280
that i've

513
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
read you have to search

514
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,720
one month for every ten thousand dollars

515
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,919
of pay

516
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,000
so one month for every ten thousand

517
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,360
dollars of pay

518
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
well depending on how long you've been

519
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,799
in the industry

520
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,720
and what your current pay is what you

521
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
would accept for pay

522
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,640
and what you could fit in with this

523
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,799
these searches could take a long

524
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,799
long time not only do you have to

525
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,160
to to be able to land that job and once

526
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,679
again you have to take all those other

527
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,520
things into consideration

528
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,440
like culture fit

529
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,799
all the little pieces and parts that

530
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,000
we're talking about

531
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
finally um your inner voice could be

532
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,160
just wrong

533
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
right uh you hear it often impostor's

534
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,280
endo

535
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,320
syndrome i'm just as guilty about it

536
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,960
as uh just about everybody else's in

537
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,440
some

538
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,559
regard um

539
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,440
you know this kind of thing held me back

540
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
for many many years i probably

541
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
could have changed jobs many times over

542
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,799
over my tenure

543
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,320
or two decades with broadway bank

544
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,160
but i didn't and a lot of it was like

545
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,480
yeah i mean i'm just not good enough to

546
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,960
do that

547
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,679
i just don't know that kind of thing or

548
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,559
you know

549
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,559
and stuff one of the problems for myself

550
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,400
i never finished my college degree so

551
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,760
that makes it a little bit interesting

552
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
right uh at broadway bank i actually uh

553
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,440
made it up to

554
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,799
vice president and he

555
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
had 25 years of i.t experience

556
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
i worked for vars prior to working for

557
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
broadway bank

558
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,600
and there were still times it would be

559
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,840
like i'm just not good enough for that

560
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
i'm not i'm not qualified enough for

561
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,919
that so

562
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
those kind of things held me back

563
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,360
and i just want to make sure that they

564
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,799
don't hold you back

565
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,879
for that job change

566
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,360
it's too late that job is already taken

567
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,320
there's no place for me yeah that inner

568
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
voice is wrong

569
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,600
um i had that same thought in my head

570
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,919
in 1993 that i've started too late

571
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,640
no i don't have my novel certification i

572
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
don't

573
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,000
i'm not in the industry i'm a carpenter

574
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
you know i do construction for a living

575
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,039
um you know there's no way i could do

576
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,559
that kind of thing

577
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,120
and stuff and if there was there's the

578
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
jobs are already taken there's already

579
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
you know 65 000 people out there that

580
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,400
are certified to

581
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,520
um work on novell systems

582
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,840
got their cne and stuff so how could i

583
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
possibly get in that field how could i

584
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,440
possibly you know do anything to advance

585
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,640
myself

586
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
i was wrong in 1993 i guarantee you i

587
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,760
was wrong and if you're in that boat

588
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,400
today

589
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,679
i guarantee you you're wrong there are

590
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,120
plenty of jobs out there

591
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,720
you just need to go fight for them you

592
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,559
need to find them and keep searching

593
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,480
and fight for them and you will find the

594
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
job that you're looking for

595
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,880
so it's not too late those jobs are not

596
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,000
already taken

597
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
um the other day i got a new washer and

598
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,159
dryer and one of the guys

599
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,000
that was delivering the place kind of

600
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,520
got around to so what do you do i said

601
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:33,840
well

602
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,559
i'm a cyber security uh guy at a local

603
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,159
financial institution and

604
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,159
he's like oh man i'd like to do that i

605
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,760
was kind of looking into that and stuff

606
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,480
and i go

607
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,640
you know if you can put in a washer and

608
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,080
dryer you understand

609
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
processes you can understand procedures

610
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,280
and everything else

611
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
you've got to do this this and this and

612
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,880
this and it works

613
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
if you have any kind of uh background

614
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,120
that would kind of make you think of

615
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,559
that i said

616
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,000
yeah i bet i bet i know what you're

617
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
thinking i told him i said you're

618
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
thinking there's probably no

619
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,360
jobs available for for people like you

620
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,000
that you know

621
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,919
in in this field you want to move over

622
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,280
you're wrong you know

623
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,520
go find that job at a help desk go find

624
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,640
that job

625
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,520
um you know doing uh the hardware team

626
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,320
or whatever

627
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,720
and work your way into another job

628
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,480
because it's it's easier once you get

629
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
that first job in it

630
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,919
to move around so um

631
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,679
my first job in it after doing

632
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,679
construction for over a decade

633
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,000
was um as a sales assistant for a var

634
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,720
um i made the sales proposals up and the

635
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
reason i did that is because

636
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
i could tell the difference between a

637
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,039
parallel cable and a scuzzy cable at the

638
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,520
time

639
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,840
so the printer cable because you can by

640
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,159
the way it's a 36 pin versus the 50 pin

641
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,039
connector on the end um still know the

642
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,080
difference

643
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,120
probably have one in this building

644
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,400
somewhere um so

645
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,000
that's the kind of deal it's not too

646
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,679
late the jobs are out there

647
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,679
um you have to fight for them you have

648
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,960
to you know

649
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,840
overcome your own friction to go get

650
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,320
them

651
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,159
don't wait for an opportunity to come to

652
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,360
you even if you're

653
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
in the it field and you want to try

654
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,360
something else in the id field

655
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,880
once again you're going to have to go

656
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,559
out and seize the job

657
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,240
you're going to have to go out and find

658
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
it and fight for it

659
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,799
so go get a good resume

660
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
get it looked at there are people that

661
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,480
will evaluate your resume that are right

662
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,039
here

663
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,960
inside of b-sides right now go and

664
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,159
get moving forward on different

665
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,440
uh things that you can do

666
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
to to learn what's going on

667
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,760
if you don't know how packets move

668
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,840
through a network that's a great start

669
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,600
i was very fortunate my ham radio

670
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,440
hobby helped me out on that

671
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,640
because i was able to learn how packets

672
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,559
move through networks by looking at them

673
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,080
over the uh air on on vhf radio

674
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,200
i helped build packet radio networks um

675
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,840
and and did that for six or seven years

676
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,559
before i ever got into an i.t field

677
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,159
i waited too long i should have gotten

678
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,240
moved a little bit faster than that

679
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,720
um but you know that's the deal you got

680
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,159
to keep on

681
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,720
moving forward and and getting things

682
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,039
done

683
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
so don't wait for an opportunity to come

684
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,840
to you

685
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,799
in that fact have you ever heard of the

686
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,440
cult of the done manifesto

687
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
uh brie pettis uh came up with that um

688
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,679
matter of fact i

689
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,840
got a link i'll drop it in the discord

690
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
channel in the breakout and also in the

691
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
track three and the thick of it

692
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
um here make sure that's going good

693
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,960
um he kind of came up with this

694
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
it's imperfect and it it has problems

695
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,120
but it it's it's it's it got some really

696
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,159
good points

697
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,440
how do you get done with anything right

698
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
so three states of knowing not knowing

699
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,360
action and completion i'm going to read

700
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,159
them all to you

701
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,880
you know except things are a draft

702
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
there's no editing stage

703
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
yeah this is good especially if you're

704
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,120
learning

705
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,640
pretending you know what you're doing is

706
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,840
almost the same as knowing what you're

707
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,640
doing

708
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,279
just accept you know what you're doing

709
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,240
even if you don't

710
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
and do it right

711
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,559
banish procrastination the point of

712
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,400
being done is not to finish

713
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,320
but to get other things done the more

714
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,520
things you get done

715
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,640
the more things you can get done so get

716
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,679
things done

717
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,679
get that resume out there go for that

718
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
job

719
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,200
yeah once you're done toss it

720
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,679
laugh at perfection right if you wait

721
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,000
for that perfect resume where every word

722
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,760
is perfect and exactly what you're

723
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,000
waiting for blah blah blah

724
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,480
you're waiting too long you know give it

725
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,240
a best shot get it reviewed

726
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,679
they like it get it out there

727
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,840
people with dirty hands without i'm

728
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,360
sorry people without dirty hands are

729
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,080
wrong

730
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,720
doing something makes you right doing it

731
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,919
just getting out there and getting

732
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,159
things done

733
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,400
gives you the right to be out there and

734
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,200
getting things done

735
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,600
yeah failure accounts is done i went to

736
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,120
that job interview and i didn't get the

737
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,919
job

738
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,320
oh well next a matter of fact here's a

739
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,600
goal for you

740
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,320
i want you to set how many jobs that you

741
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,640
go on an interview for and you don't get

742
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,600
you get five of those then you win

743
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,159
you're right

744
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
you just consider yourself a winner

745
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,440
because you've at least put yourself out

746
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,080
there five

747
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,720
times i bet you can't make it five

748
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,520
without getting a job

749
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,760
destruction is a variant of done can't

750
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,600
put this one on jobs

751
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,360
um if you have an idea publish it on the

752
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,720
internet it counts as the ghost of done

753
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
you know blogs are still a thing youtube

754
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
is still the thing go out and

755
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,320
research something and put something out

756
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,000
on it get some information

757
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,679
out there help at a b sides help at a

758
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,919
texas cyber summit get yourself

759
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,880
networked into

760
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,200
doing things done is the engine of more

761
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,480
and it just doesn't get any cleaner than

762
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,279
that

763
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,320
you know if the more you do

764
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
the more you're done the more you get

765
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,440
done

766
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,640
so uh

767
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,159
does anybody have any questions or

768
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,320
anything is there any questions in chat

769
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,360

770
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,919
i just want to go ahead and look i know

771
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,320
this is supposed to be an hour long but

772
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,360
yeah it doesn't really take that long

773
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,720
a matter of fact i almost wish that

774
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,559
you'd spend the next 30 minutes

775
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,159
working on your resume right working on

776
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,240
your ability to go out and find that

777
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
next job if you're looking for another

778
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,760
job or to make the job that you

779
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,799
currently have better

780
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,520
paul i love again thank you so much i

781
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,880
love your story

782
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,559
and how you you tell us how

783
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,120
you were in one career and you didn't

784
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,960
have any experience and you got into i.t

785
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
and how you phased into cyber security

786
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,080
a lot of folks now that are trying to

787
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
get into space they feel like

788
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,480
they have to run to college and get a

789
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,120
degree

790
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,679
um you have to be done right and you

791
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,880
don't have to be done

792
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,799
yeah it isn't the case well i love your

793
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,559
store your personal story

794
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,960
how you can share that with folks out in

795
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,279
the space that it can be done

796
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,039
because a lot of young people or a lot

797
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,640
of people that are looking to transition

798
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,960
out of one career into another

799
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
and they feel like they need to just

800
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,159
jump into a cyber security

801
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,200
role and sometimes that's not the case

802
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,360
um where i i think this space as a whole

803
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,039
we're we're in a place where a lot of

804
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,720
companies don't have the capability to

805
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,480
do on-the-job training you've got to

806
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,200
know some

807
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,039
you've got to have some understanding

808
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,039
and some type of hands-on experience

809
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,240
doing something

810
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,880
or some inclination showing folks or

811
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,360
showing the hiring managers in hr

812
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,480
that you've got to you have the ability

813
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,080
to learn um

814
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,039
getting that cert or the degree you have

815
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,919
to bypass

816
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,039
hr or the gatekeeper but i think if you

817
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,039
can somehow bypass that

818
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,919
by showing um your activities and

819
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,080
capture the flag events or any type

820
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,360
of uh cyber or i.t related events or

821
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,320
networking events

822
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,799
can you go kind of more into that on you

823
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,879
know

824
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,640
i'm a mentor also for um cyberpatriot

825
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,520

826
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,880
great organization

827
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,760

828
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,360

831
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,240
school

832

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,080
for them helping them with things as

837
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,679
simple as you know

838
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,399
how does ssh work or how does https work

839
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,760
or how does encryption work

840
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,960
um you go learn it yourself and you tell

841
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,440
them

842
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,960
or you already know it you tell them

843
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,799
whatever it takes um

844
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,440
but one of the things i do encourage

845
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,840
everyone to do is to get a degree

846
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,559
if you can uh if you're predisposed and

847
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,000
you can go ahead and get it done and you

848
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
have the capabilities of getting it done

849
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,080
there are a lot more opportunities for

850
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,000
work for you it is difficult

851
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,880
for me i i can't tell you i throw my

852
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
resume around

853
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,799
a lot while i was um kind of looking for

854
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,240
different positions

855
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,559
i did not get call backs i never on a

856
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,840
vast majority of them

857
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,600
because i guarantee you when they looked

858
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,760
at my resume versus others

859
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,240
it didn't say degree and a lot of the

860
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,279
jobs out there

861
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,880
demand a degree and i'm like i got 25

862
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,440
years of experience in i.t

863
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,159
securing financial institutions uh and

864
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:04,480
and

865
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,080
keeping them up and functioning and

866
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,399
running that didn't matter to these

867
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:08,880
people

868
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,919
they were just hr they and sadly they it

869
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,600
never got to the hiring managers to

870
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,480
understand

871
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,480
the difference there right um so

872
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,240
get a degree if you can if you can't get

873
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
a degree that's fine there are

874
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,880
tons of work out there tons of work um

875
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,200
and

876
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,039
once again mentor cyber patriot kids um

877
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,720
get involved with these organizations

878
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,080
here

879
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,159
once again on your on your resume

880
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,159
volunteer for elf louise

881
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,039

882
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,640
bank put that on the resume

883
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
you know say that not only you're

884
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,840
helping you know

885
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,039
uh in your field but you're also

886
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,000
broadly helping the community um those

887
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,120
kind of things really

888
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,960
make a difference uh i think when it

889
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,399
finally gets to the hiring managers

890
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,840
does that help kim i mean great great

891
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,480
info

892
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,080
and that's what i was gonna say is when

893
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
you're looking at people's resumes

894
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,640
uh what do you look for if they don't

895
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,679
have

896
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,720
the relevant experience from

897
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,240
a specific employer um so again i i

898
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,880
i echo that as just showing what you're

899
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,679
doing in

900
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,399
personal development along with uh

901
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,360
education and certifications

902
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,919
and when we hired uh interns over uh

903
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:26,720
broadway

904
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,760
um i was part of the process there we

905
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,120
looked for people

906
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,279
that um there were a couple of people

907
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,880
that applied they were done they were

908
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,159
they they were job ready

909
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,640
right the whole point of our intern

910
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,200
program

911
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,480
was to get people job ready

912
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,640
at least understand what they needed to

913
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,399
do in the job

914
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,880
for example um that we could only work

915
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,720
20 hours a week with the interns

916
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,320
so we were like okay you're only working

917
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,000
one hour eight hour day and then you're

918
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,720
coming in

919
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,880
saturday at 9 00 pm and we're leaving

920
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,799
about sunday morning at six

921
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,320
because that's the job that we're

922
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,840
looking for

923
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,519
in i.t we're going to be doing some

924
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,279
major upgrades and so

925
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,440
we made sure that they had active roles

926
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,519
in those upgrades

927
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,120
because we wanted them to understand

928
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,360
exactly what it takes to do it work

929
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,880
what it's not all hey i'm in

930
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,120
you know normal hours and that kind of

931
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,960
stuff

932
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,360
so if you can find an interim program

933
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,799
like that where they're just not having

934
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,240
you do data entry or

935
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,399
some other thing um that's that's the

936
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,679
best kind to be in

937
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,720
the one that we had had is we literally

938
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,240
week after week after week we ran them

939
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,080
through every single area of i.t

940
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,279
from hardware to the cio and um

941
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,679
database administrators whatever um they

942
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,279
got to work with everybody and then the

943
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,159
last week we said

944
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,519
your choice what do you want to work

945
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,200
with

946
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,320
so that

947
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,799
actually helped people focus on the

948
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,320
different aspects of what they wanted to

949
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,880
do

950
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,600
um so there's there's a lot of things

951
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
out there than i'm just a hacking a red

952
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,039
team kind of thing yeah

953
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,039
there's there's so many job

954
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,320
opportunities out there for

955
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,720
everything in cyber security oh that's a

956
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,239
good idea where is that

957
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,719
i think i have um you want to know what

958
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,119
cyber security looks like right

959
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,359
um i think i can put that on the screen

960
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,000
that's your break room right what's that

961
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,679
i said that your wallpaper that's your

962
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,359
break room right

963
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,320
yeah it is my break room that's funny i

964
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,520
didn't know you saw that as a flash

965
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,960
going by but yeah i took a picture of

966
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,000
that break room and it's really

967
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,839
nice because they won't let us into that

968
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,440
building anymore because i work in

969
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,560
another building

970
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,679
um um so yeah it's pretty funny so i use

971
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,839
that as a background sometimes for my uh

972
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,879
my team's meetings and stuff um so

973
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,839

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,040
hey paul i have a question if uh you

981
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,000
would

982
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,079
be so kind to answer it yeah i'd be

983
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,839
happy to

984
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,440
uh it's in the discord but somebody

985
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,320
asked can you apply to a job posting

986
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,839
more than once

987
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,720
if your resume has increased after a

988
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,400
length of time

989
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,920
sure because a lot of times those jobs

990
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,760
also change right um

991
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,560
the way that they're listed and posted

992
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,200
um

993
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,640
so yeah

994
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,160
i don't think that's a problem at all

995
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,480
and especially if your

996
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,760
uh work situation or whatever

997
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,480
uh has been modified i'm pretty sure

998
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,000
that it would not be a problem at all

999
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,200
and that should be what i'm looking for

1000
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,560
thank you

1001
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,279
oh no problem and

1002
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,680
so that's what i t in cyber security

1003
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,119
looks like

1004
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,359
and i guarantee you no matter what type

1005
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,720
of person you are

1006
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,079
you fit there some box some little one

1007
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,960
of those little bubbles is your bubble

1008
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,400
so um you know whether it's framework or

1009
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,079
standards or compliance or

1010
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,920
whatever um there's just so much to do

1011
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,240
right

1012
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,839
and i've already posted this out there

1013
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,200
in the operating room yeah

1014
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,560
and thank you so much for sharing that

1015
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,880
again it's it's really a great framework

1016
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
or a roadmap for folks to look at

1017
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,160
because um i'm a recruiter by trade and

1018
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,320
i talk to a lot of people that tell me i

1019
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,640
want to get into cyber security

1020
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
okay what part because it is really a

1021
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,560
mild

1022
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,240
wide and in in a mile deep um there's so

1023
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
many things

1024
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,359
and and they still don't know so i

1025
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,440
always say look you know i think it

1026
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,480
really is you know what

1027
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,119
what really interests you in information

1028
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,320
technology

1029
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,720
because then once you step back then you

1030
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,560
can look at okay what part of that do

1031
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,320
you want to protect then

1032
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,359
um what piece of it so that's that's

1033
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:17,920
great and

1034
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,440
that's that's great because there are

1035
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,200
roles that are not technical

1036
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,440
and a lot of people think that being a

1037
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
cyber security person

1038
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,359
is you're a hardcore technical person

1039
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,160
and

1040
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,800
we need writers yes exactly people that

1041
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,079
know how to write

1042
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,599
very well and communicate through

1043
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,520
different policies right

1044
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,960
right my big

1045
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,040
my big areas are the security

1046
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,640
architecture area and the security

1047
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,680
operations area

1048
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,440
that's my um kind of bread and butter

1049
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,839
areas great

1050
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,000
well okay vulnerability too how to do

1051
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,839
that risk analysis

1052
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,960
assessment um so

1053
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,720
i know that uh one of the sponsors here

1054
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
is ddi i'm a big fan of theirs

1055
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,640
uh to say the least so

1056
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,280
i really recommend frontline six is a

1057
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,880
vulnerability management system

1058
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,240
so there's my my plug for one of our

1059
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,079
sponsors for b-side san antonio

1060
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,839
all right hey paul one more question yes

1061
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,000
uh and this is a personal question for

1062
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,520
me is

1063
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,040
uh students such as myself

1064
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,839
trying to break into i.t would you

1065
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,040
recommend jumping

1066
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,680
and specializing in cyber security right

1067
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,040
away or would you recommend

1068
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,320
maybe getting a more general maybe a sys

1069
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,800
admin

1070
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,440
or maybe a support role first to build

1071
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,280
those foundations and maybe get into the

1072
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,000
rhythm of things

1073
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,800
before jumping into a more specialized

1074
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,240
security role

1075
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,280
um i definitely fight if you can for

1076
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,079
any kind of internship um it will help

1077
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,480
you

1078
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
in your resume down the road it'll also

1079
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,079
help you hopefully focus

1080
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,359
on what you're looking to do down the

1081
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,760
road as well uh and if you get into an

1082
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,560
internship

1083
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,119
um pick the brains of anybody around you

1084
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,160
to try and

1085
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,880
see what you might want to fit into like

1086
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,040
we're saying this is a very diverse

1087
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,680
field and so depending on

1088
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,680
your natural abilities and this

1089
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,480
there's also a document out there it's

1090
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,079
it's kind of weird but

1091
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,680
i like it a lot um if you look up nist

1092
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,040
nice n-i-c-e um

1093
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,200
and i could probably go grab that one

1094
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
too i'll throw it in discord

1095
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,119
um the nice document gives you a road

1096
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,800
map basically

1097
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,480
i want to do um this uh this bubble here

1098
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:46,800
or

1099
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,440
this this uh training thing cloud

1100
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,800
security bubble

1101
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,520
what do i need to have to do that cloud

1102
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,400
security bubble

1103
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,400
or to do you know i'm a

1104
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,920
particular role in in cyber security

1105
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,960
they mapped out mainly for government

1106
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,160
employees

1107
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
all of the different aspects that you

1108
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
would require to be a cio or

1109
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,760
cso or a sock engineer or a help desk

1110
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,800
technician

1111
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,560
um and it's nice because you can start

1112
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,319
using that as a roadmap you know if i

1113
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,920
did this kind of role i could check

1114
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,680
these boxes off and go learn these

1115
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,200
different tasks

1116
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,560
a matter of fact it talks about i

1117
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,880
believe abilities

1118
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,480
tasks um oh gosh anybody else good with

1119
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,319
a nice document here it's been about

1120
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,240
a year since i've looked at it um

1121
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
abilities tasks and skills

1122
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,560
i think skills is one of them as well so

1123
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,480
if you have a

1124
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,839
things that you've done things that you

1125
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,480
learn things you can apply

1126
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
it's really it's a nice document and

1127
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,079
plus it kind of gives you a great idea

1128
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,240
of like this document here in front of

1129
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,520
me with all of these

1130
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,079
it shows you a vast amount of roles that

1131
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,119
you can do in cyber security as well

1132
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,280
i'm trying to work with our teams to try

1133
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
and rewrite some of our

1134
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,200
job descriptions to fit the nice

1135
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,480
document

1136
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,480
i think it's a good framework for um

1137
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,839
for that once again i can't recommend

1138
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,599
staying in school and trying to get your

1139
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,680
degree if you possibly can

1140
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,839
it definitely has hurt me a number of

1141
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,040
times when it comes to

1142
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,960
job opportunities even as far back as

1143
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,280
1994

1144
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
or whatever um the one team i was

1145
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,160
working with they were like you'd be

1146
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
perfect for the job oh i can't hire

1147
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,720
you you don't have a degree

1148
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,839
bummer um but in some ways i'm kind of

1149
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,160
it all worked out you know it still

1150
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,040
worked out very

1151
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,319
very well for me but the main thing is

1152
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,240
gotta gotta go for it gotta keep that

1153
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,680
going and get that first job

1154
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,160
and don't give up just keep trying you

1155
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,680
can't take it personal you just gotta

1156
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,040
keep going

1157
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,359
because it is hard it is hard to break

1158
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,400
in it is

1159
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,280
um being on the other side it's it's

1160
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,200
very frustrating we've got all of these

1161
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,880
really great smart people

1162
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,040
that are wanting to get into space and

1163
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,200
you have so many employers that are so

1164
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,640
short-sighted because they

1165
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,680
can't see past we gotta have people with

1166
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,839
certain experience and i get it because

1167
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,760
uh they don't really have the framework

1168
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,800
to train folks

1169
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,839
but um so it really leaves the candidate

1170
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:26,480
or the

1171
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,520
um the job seeker um you know more

1172
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,000
added stress that they've got to just be

1173
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,760
they've just got to keep pressing on

1174
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,079
and they've got to keep pushing um it's

1175
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,760
it's very frustrating but

1176
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,839
once you get into space it's definitely

1177
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,440
worth it

1178
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,200
it is it really is um i i i'm very lucky

1179
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
um

1180
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,760
traditionally my family is in

1181
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,240
construction um my grandfather

1182
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,000
started the company my father owned that

1183
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,760
company at one time

1184
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,319
um when i was a kid growing up i just

1185
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,599
knew i was going to be in construction

1186
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,720
basically

1187
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,359
from almost time i can remember anything

1188
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,000
um

1189
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,599
but i always had a passion for

1190
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,680
electronics i always had a passion for

1191
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,839
computers and um then got into ham radio

1192
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,119
and with all of that it really kind of

1193
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:13,920
focused me

1194
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,200
into that technical type role i always

1195
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,599
liked

1196
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,160
the more geeky technical type aspects of

1197
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,760
things

1198
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:41,839
i appreciate your insight

1199
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,960
you
