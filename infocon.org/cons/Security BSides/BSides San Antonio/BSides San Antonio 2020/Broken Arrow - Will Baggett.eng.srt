1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
all right broken arrow in the 60s the

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,760
u.s

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,160
army had a term for if the enemy had

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,359
been

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,200
if the enemy had penetrated the u.s

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,040
forces and they needed reinforcements

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,719
air support

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,920
because the enemy was inside the

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,480
perimeter

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,720
the nature of this talk is about what

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
happens how can we help the domestic

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
abuse victim who comes to us as

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
information security professionals

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,519
because

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,760
the situation has moved from in my

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
slides here we go

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,479

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
there you go try it now

31
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,079
all right

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640
do you have control you should have

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,119
control

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,360
okay

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,119

36
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,640

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,840
yes sir thank you for everybody who

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
stuck around through this i mean

39
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,399
or there probably should be a sans

40
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,840
course in uh remote

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,920
presentations after this pandemic is

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,599
over so

43
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,360
the idea of we've heard the beginning

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
about the enemies inside the perimeter

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,800
people come to us as information

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,520
security professionals and they say

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
instead of fix my desktop i build a

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
computer over the weekend

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,360
i'm setting up wi-fi they want us to fix

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
their situation

51
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,959
they're being stalked somehow by an ex

52
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,840
by a

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
former partner going through a divorce

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,840
split

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,519
what have you but they come to us

56
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,720
because information security

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
professionals to say can you fix my

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
desktop and like most people who get a

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
jared ticket in the queue on a friday

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
afternoon

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
you want to do something you want to be

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,239
able to say here's how i can do it

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
here's how you fix this a

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
system architect versus somebody who's

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,599
working on the blue team versus somebody

66
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,519
who's doing digital forensics

67
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,400
it's a different skill set the purpose

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
of this talk is to give you a general

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
framework on what we found

70
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,840
as operation safe escape

71
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,560
what the common things are that you're

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
encountering

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
when people are going through domestic

74
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
abuse situations

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,519
i'm a volunteer with operation safe

76
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,519
escape if you want to

77

78
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,280
out of mexico

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,519
situations the website is go

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,120
askgrows.com

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
safe safeascape.org if you want to

82
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,159
volunteer

83
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,879
help at safe escape.org or if people

84
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,840
want to

85
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
seek guidance to help digitally

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
disconnect an abuser

87
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,400
help safescape.org is how people can

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,599
reach us

89
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,319
another good resource is the smart girls

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
guide to digital privacy

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,760
now that said

92
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,680
the three information security

93
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
principles of data confidentiality data

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
availability and data integrity

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
we take those that tree ad and we apply

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,799
it to this

97
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
of helping somebody get away from a bad

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,000
situation

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,239
you want to control the environment

100
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,400
watch for identity theft

101
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,239
and then make sure you have data

102
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,599
availability that way you still have the

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,519
cool little cia triad there

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,199
but it means something just a little bit

105
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
different now out of these three the

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,918
most important

107
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,800
is to control the environment meaning

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
not just the digital

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,919
but the physical environment that's

110
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,199
something we don't usually think about

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
physical security in our daily jobs as

112
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,639
information security you might think

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
about phishing you know dropping the usb

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,520
drive by the entrance to the facility

115
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,600
but the hardcore physical security

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
making someone's physically safe

117
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
that's not usually in our swim lane

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
and for controlling an environment

119
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
whether it's you or somebody going

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,800
through a bad situation

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,199
another three things to keep in mind

122
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,440
your personal security the data security

123
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,280
and family disclosures

124
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,479
and by that for personal security the

125
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,639
most important is to get off the x

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
when i was actively with cia we had a

127
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,680
overseas meetings go bad the case

128
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,000
officer

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,960
came back to the station and the station

130
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,680
chief

131
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
markey after hearing about how this

132
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
situation just kept getting worse and

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,680
worse and worse

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
had this gym he said no bad situation

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
ever got better by sticking around

136
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,039
whether that's a personal relationship

137
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:27,840
with abuse

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,000
whether it's a bad job situation a

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
living situation it's not going to get

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,639
better by staying it's okay to leave

141
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,479
and as i was going through this for the

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,840
leadership team at revolutionary

143
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,400
security

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,080
uh jim pruitt one of our leaders said

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
you never have to ask permission to

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
leave a dangerous situation he gave the

147
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,759
example of

148
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,840
a uh engineer who was in the field

149
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
and people were out of the bar and they

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
wanted to drive home in one car for the

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,960
driver was drunk

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
the guy didn't want to take a cab

153
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,919
because he was afraid of getting in

154
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,639
trouble for

155
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,199
having a separate expense and that's for

156
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,160
jim's line

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,520
you never have to ask permission to

158
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
leave a dangerous situation applies to

159
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,880
the domestic abuse front

160
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
if things are bad leave and then figure

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
out how to make it work afterwards but

162
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,160
most important is to get off the x

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,039
to have a bug out bag packed uh this was

164
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,880
a live physical presentation i do a show

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,000
of hands

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
or who knows what a bug out bag is but

167
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
for the digital presentation a bug out

168
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:28,880
bag

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
is a bag that you keep with you whether

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,400
it's a backpack

171
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,440
purse knapsack with

172
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
a credit card your driver's license

173
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
important documents passport birth

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
certificates

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,360
your laptop if you can phone a phone

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,000
charger

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,120
that way if you have to leave in a

178
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
moment's notice you can leave and then

179
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,240
begin to rebuild your life after you

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,319
have a bad situation

181
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,160
you want to keep your electronic devices

182
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,319
with you with a caveat

183
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,160
of one of your stalker wear on those

184
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,599
devices and i'll show you how to defeat

185
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,840
that in a minute

186
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,319
if you have the ability not everybody in

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,520
the audience or not everybody we

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,039
encounter is going to have this

189
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,120
but consider having a prepaid cell phone

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
and a prepaid credit card somewhere

191
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,400
outside whether it's in your office a

192
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
friend's house

193
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,479
so that if the abuser disconnects your

194
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,120
cell phone

195
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
disconnects the credit card deactivates

196
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,160
the credit cards

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
excuse me you still have the ability to

198
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,759
at least get a hotel room for the night

199
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,080
or two

200
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
to contact people to let them know

201
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
what's going on

202
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,160
just in case you have that loss of

203
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
service you know a backup on your basic

204
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,960
raid service

205
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,080
let me talk a little bit about what

206
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,919
happens how to flee the situation and

207
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,400
we'll get

208
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,319
into that more but what if they leave

209
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
what if the abuser leaves the situation

210
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
and you're left behind in your house in

211
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,639
your condo in your apartment

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
most important thing consider this

213
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560
of course change the passwords i want to

214
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,400
say that a thousand times in the next

215
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,319
45 minutes what i would do

216
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,039
hypothetically i would call the landlord

217
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,720
i would call a locksmith whoever

218
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,680
controls the physical lock to the house

219
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,759
change the locks change the key codes

220
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,440
the law enforcement officers are going

221
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,599
to respond differently to

222
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,560
an abuser return to the house versus an

223
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,440
abuser broke

224
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
into the house that's going to get a

225
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,879
different level of response and get

226
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,039
more help for you so

227
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,160
a bad situation doesn't occur so in this

228
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,240
timeline as the locksmith is coming as

229
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
the landlord's coming to change locks

230
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,159
and

231
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,760
garage door codes start to change your

232
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,719
passwords

233
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,760
and i've got here a lot of people have

234
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,200
suggestions from these talks i've

235
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
incorporated them

236
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,040
change your garage or remote access

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
frequency because sometimes if the car

238
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,560
has the garage door access code

239
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
programmed into the car itself

240
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
all the former person has to just drive

241
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
up to the house hit the garage door code

242
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
they're back in the garage

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,680
a lot of people don't lock your garage

244
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
door

245
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,959
they're back in so remember to change

246
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,440
that garage short code too

247
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,800
so you've got a couple of physical

248
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,680
things to change here

249
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
and the importance of changing all the

250
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:23,839
codes is this

251
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,959
in domestic situations such as a father

252
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,480
and his two children

253
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,959
having a disagreement such as anakin

254
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,640
luke and leah

255
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,560
an order code still checks out a lot of

256
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,640
people forget to change the basic

257
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
passwords and the basic passcodes

258
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
after a divorce you remember to change

259
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
your garage shortcode your access

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
code harden the perimeter first and then

261
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,080
work

262
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,480
forwards to change your router passwords

263
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,480

264
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,839
if you can go to

265
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,480
genealogy ancestry.com simple google

266
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,800
search it's not

267
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
a ocean exercise to be able to find

268
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,519
basic information on people

269
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
go to a known safe machine change your

270

security questions and your passwords

271
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,480
but it's okay to lie online that's one

272
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
of the key takeaways for this

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
presentation

274
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,360
when creating a new security question

275
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
fabricate your favorite locations

276
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,079
your informations and events they're not

277
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,519
looking for accuracy

278
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,200
excuse me they're not looking for truth

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,959
they're looking for accuracy

280
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,760
where did your parents meet tatooine

281
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,839
what was your high school mascot

282
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,040

283
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
married

284
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,040
on naboo it doesn't have to be where you

285
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
truly got married it just has to be

286
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,440
whatever the system is told is your

287
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,079
answer

288
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,600
something that's not easily searchable

289
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,120
don't get so acute that you can't

290
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
remember the answers to your own

291
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,839
security questions but make it something

292
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,600
that you can remember it's okay to lie

293
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,480
americans are

294
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,959
trained from we're taught never to lie

295
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
to always tell the truth

296
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,959
winston churchill said it's okay the

297
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,959
truth is guarded by

298
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,680
that i can't talk today too much zero

299
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,320
the truth

300
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,680
is protected by a bodyguard of lies

301
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
definitely apply that here you don't

302
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
have to tell the truth about your

303
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,279
security questions

304
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
looking at your route it's a little bit

305
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
of an abrupt transition

306
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,360
you come in you gotta change your

307
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
passwords first thing is to look at your

308
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,120
router screen

309
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
see what other devices are connected

310
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
take a screenshot that could be evidence

311
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
for later

312
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,720
so here you got a galaxy x8 you have a

313
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,240
mac laptop

314
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,959
and an iphone renamed pc you don't have

315
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
to name your device

316
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
jim's iphone it can be whatever you want

317
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,000
if it's something very specific

318
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
colonel sanders iphone you're coming to

319
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
the top of the attention anybody's using

320
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
cali or looking at logs that

321
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,079
this is someone's specifics iphone

322
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,399
connecting

323
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,000
different talk all together but harden

324
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
yourself and not have the exact name of

325
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,639
who you are

326
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,279
on your phone so here we see there's no

327
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,959
rogue devices connected

328
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,160
and we'll come back to that in a minute

329
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,079
this is key for these situations take a

330
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
screenshot if there is

331
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,800
and again this talk can't cover every

332
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
router that's in production

333
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,160
remember to search for your specific

334
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,639
router look at the logs just like you

335
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:24,959
would

336
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,720
in a nine to five job looking at the

337
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
logs with splunk capture the logs to see

338
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
if there's an anomalous traffic there

339
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,839
that doesn't belong

340
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,360
so you've changed your the locksmith is

341
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
coming

342
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,079
you've changed the wi-fi password now

343
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
you go to your smartphone

344
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,719
to change this

345
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,279
while you're changing your password

346
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,120
things to look at

347
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,320
you go to settings

348
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
and then you go to scroll down a little

349
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,920
bit and you can see the number of

350
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
devices you are connected to that middle

351
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,279
picture

352
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
and that's the number of apple devices

353
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
that are sharing your id

354
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,360
it's very common where people think

355
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
their infosec gurus their hacker elite

356
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,839
they're hacking the planet

357
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,920
they add themselves to their spouse's

358
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,200
former spouse's

359
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,959
iphone so they're getting dropped copies

360
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,120
of all the messages

361
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,440
the next thing you want to go to find my

362
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,480
iphone and see

363
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,320
where your device is located because

364
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
you're giving the opposition a blue

365
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
force tracker to see everywhere you're

366
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
looking

367
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
and you can see the number of devices

368
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
that you can track through this account

369
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
you'll want to take screenshots one then

370
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,000
disable it

371
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,839
next thing we want to go to share my

372
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,519
location

373
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,639
and family sharing very simple for this

374
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,920
for the salt

375
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
you don't want to share your location

376
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,440
you don't want the opposition we'll just

377
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,800
call it that the opposition to know

378
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
where you are at every moment going

379
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,959
through

380
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,480
that situation where you're fleeing an

381
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
abuser the second thing we saw this

382
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,040
working with nato special forces

383
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,199
in summit uh the agency where people had

384
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,040
photo sharing set up with family so when

385
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,480
they're taking pictures

386
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
of the war zone of whatever site

387
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,040
whatever battlefield their cool guy hero

388
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,320
photos

389
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
those photos were getting shared back to

390
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
their kids their spouse their

391
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
grandmother phone

392
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,680
their phones definitely in a combat

393
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
situation intel situation you don't want

394
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,560
to have it enabled

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
but the same here if you're going

396
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
through an abuse situation you don't

397
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
want to share your new life or

398
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,959
documentation of

399
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,360
evidence with the abuser you want to

400
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,120
make sure this is turned off

401
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
whether they enable it whether you

402
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
enable it at this point

403
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,399
it does matter but turn it off

404
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,279
a new one apple keeps adding features

405
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,480
we'll call them features

406
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
i call them security risk but they call

407
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
them features test

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,720
text message forwarding so here we have

409
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,240
this text message boarding to two

410
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,880
devices

411
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
this is set up to go to both of my macs

412
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,519
that's finally good i know these devices

413
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,959
these are mine

414
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,800
but if this goes to the opposition's

415
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
phone

416
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
your imessage and your sms messages that

417
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,839
go to your i account

418
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,320
ios account are now copied over to the

419
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,399
opposition's device as well so they can

420
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,880
see everything you're doing

421
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,399
one case i worked the uh former spouse

422
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
had five years worth of legal battles

423
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,560
for custody increasing child support

424
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,360
just

425
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
constant harassment all because it was

426
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,959
something as simple as the spouse

427
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,160
knowing

428
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,920
where her text messages were coming from

429
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,839
so if she said i'm going out to have a

430
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,199
glass of wine with friends i'll see you

431
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,000
at five o'clock

432
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,079
at fredo's on monday morning it was

433
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,480
here's papers my attorney you went out

434
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
drinking this weekend

435
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
and left the kids unattended it's a

436
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,839
fabrication but he only knew this

437
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,759
because the text messages were forward

438
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,240
on the other side of the aisle with the

439
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
android you'll want to go and look at

440
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
the number of places you've logged into

441
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
your android phone and where that's also

442
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,680
shared so this is

443
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,399
the android messages showing up the gym

444
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,160
i can't talk today the gmail account is

445
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,240
showing up on a windows account

446
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
on an iphone and a mac you want to take

447
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,560
a screenshot of where the malicious

448
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,800
account is showing up and then disable

449
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,959
it

450
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,040
the next thing you'll want to definitely

451
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
change your password in safe machine

452
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,279
because

453
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,759
your google takeout account if you've

454
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,160
not looked into the google takeout

455
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,759
capability it's something that we've

456
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,240
used it revolutionary security for

457
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
inside our threads

458
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
we used it at nato to look and just show

459
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,079
the troops where this data is still

460
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,480
shared it's everything you've ever done

461
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,680
when you've signed into an android

462
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,480
account your

463
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,079
cell phone locations your cell phone

464
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,680
tower locations

465
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,600
your deleted text messages your deleted

466
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,720
emails your photos

467
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,120
your web traffic history it's everything

468
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
ever done with that google account

469
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
that's something once you lose that you

470
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,519
can't get it back that's a treasure

471
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,320
trove you can parse through

472
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,600
a magnet axiom magnet has donated some

473
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,360
great light a free license of vaccine to

474
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,199
operation safe escape

475
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,199
we've parsed through some google takeout

476
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,280
for abuse victims

477
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,679
and we're able to see all the data that

478
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,119
was deleted off the device

479
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,640
showing that they were compromised we

480
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,919
were able to recover that with the

481
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,880
victims help

482
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,919
through google takeout i'd say that

483
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,679
because you don't want to lose this to

484
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,079
the opposition on the apple side

485
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,839
apple security i believe is a little bit

486
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,679
better it takes

487
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,919
multiple steps for validation to request

488
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,440
the backup data you can see on the side

489
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
here the slides will be available

490
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,799
you can see all the data that's

491
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,200
available from apple it's a seven day

492
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,880
download waiting period for the

493
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,960
opportunity to then download the data

494
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
it takes multiple steps again to

495
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
validate two-factor authentication

496
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
password security questions to download

497
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,880
today it's

498
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,000
pretty secure i'm impressed with it so

499
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,799
yes this data is available from apple

500
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
but the the level of detail to get it is

501
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
a little bit more robust and much more

502
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,160
secure than google

503
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
on the facebook this is one of the

504
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
most egregious i believe it's worse it's

505
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,000
bad it's tick tock in my opinion

506
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,200
go to security settings and then active

507
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,559
sessions see where you're logged into

508
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,720
facebook because

509
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,240
not only can they shadow you facebook

510
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,600
messenger keeps a copy of all of your

511
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,799
messages the usu

512
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,640
the us t-con providers we keep at most

513
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
three days of text messages between a to

514
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
b they would have the record that

515
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,760
alice texted bob but not the details

516
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,799
facebook messenger records this file of

517
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,080
who you talk to the body

518
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,200
text of photos and then who you called

519
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,640
how long you talked to and that's kept

520
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,600
for at least a year

521
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,799
which is primed for abuse harassment

522
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,240
singing if you're talking to an attorney

523
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,720
building a case against you or just

524
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,400
general harassment so this is the holy

525
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
of holies this is what you want to keep

526
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
the opposition from gaining

527
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
that's when you've got to change your

528
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,640
password for facebook

529
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,760
and lock down your two-factor

530
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
authentication

531
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,640
other ways one particular case she lost

532
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
controller for apple account

533
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,559
there was a shared family mac

534
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,919
in the living room she left all he had

535
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,600
to do is go back here this is infused

536
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,720
2017

537
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
from before the world change back when

538
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,640
we had physical conferences

539
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,320
go to your keychain access type in

540
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,640
keychain from finder

541
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
and then search for the google account

542
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,679
this is just an example

543
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,200
whether it's gmail facebook

544
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,000
whatever reddit if you store your

545
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
password it's stored in cleartext so you

546
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
can do is type in username and password

547
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,240
the infused 2017 password with the

548
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,760
username and password is guidance

549
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,520
this technology still exists in apple

550
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
they're still using it

551
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
this is a huge vulnerability people are

552
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,320
aware that

553
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,240
you can gain someone else's password in

554
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,080
cleartext with just two or three easy

555
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,840
steps on a mac

556
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,200
i say be persistent and thorough if you

557
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,679
leave a usb drive behind when you

558
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,280
leave a house this use this photo

559
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,600
was off of a usb drive that was given to

560
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
me by a private investigator

561
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
that they thought they liked they hadn't

562
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,280
these are a covered text message that

563
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,880
somebody deleted off their phone the pi

564
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,640
recovered put on the usb drive he

565
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,200
thought he'd

566
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,600
leave it in something as simple as this

567
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,640
drill

568
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,039
a 70 program online was able just to

569
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,240
recover this file so

570
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,480
if you're going to leave data behind

571
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
wipe it don't delete it

572
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
because deleted data can be recovered

573
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,200
and used against you

574
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,000
persistent and thorough means

575
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,640
your smart devices your netflix account

576
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
your facebook

577
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,400
a neighbor bought a 65-inch tv off a

578
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,919
facebook marketplace

579
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,840
it's easier to buy this than type

580
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
locally than try to transport it across

581
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
town and move tvs are becoming

582
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,280
incredibly cheap the person who log

583
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
left their facebook login as well as

584
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,520
their youtube and their twitter the

585
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,200
question is who's looking at twitter on

586
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,559
65 inches

587
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,320
you know the person whose attorney

588
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
should be logged out of the accounts

589
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,679
you know you don't lose your license

590
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,600
because you're cyber stalking

591
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
in general but there's nothing good that

592
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,679
comes out of this

593
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
so when you leave the scene if you're

594
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,679
leaving the domestic view situation

595
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,520
logging out of facebook in the smart

596
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,919
apps on your device

597
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,760
make sure you do that because unless you

598
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,120
know to go back and look at your

599
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,919
facebook

600
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,840
account you're going to forget about

601
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,240
this and somebody can easily stalk you

602
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,600
through your continued log on

603
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
the data's still out there so there are

604
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,720
issues not issues there are

605
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,480
apps available through github where you

606
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
can plug in someone's facebook id

607
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,159
and gain their sleeping pattern

608
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,840
if you're going through a domestic abuse

609
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,360
situation

610
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,799
everything that's out there can be

611
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,559
harvested whether it's for

612
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,559
the little bit too creepy too personal

613
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,159
ads or whether it's somebody using this

614
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,440
against you now that you've got a new

615
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,799
sleep cycle knowing you're working

616
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,799
nights instead of days

617
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,400
this data is still out there i would

618
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,320
highly recommend not to use social media

619
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,559
all

620
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,480
that comes from my working encounter

621
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
intelligence at cia and

622
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
you know being a part of this community

623
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,240
a lot of people still like facebook

624
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,440
this is just one of the reasons you

625
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,799
might want to reconsider it

626
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,640
family and friend disclosures on

627
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
facebook are one of the more damaging

628
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
ways um

629
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
working with nato special ops we saw

630
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,080
them

631
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
my husband's being deployed to

632
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,320
afghanistan but i'm not supposed to tell

633
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,880
anybody

634
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,400
don't tell anybody and they posted on

635
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,799
facebook carrie underwood had the quote

636
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,240
here about

637
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,080
i'm going to restaurant and my parents

638
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,360
talk about what i'm wearing

639
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,720
when i go to this restaurant she's

640
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,559
wearing her new sweater

641
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,159
they've got to follow operational

642
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,080
security as well otherwise if you lock

643
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,960
your accounts down

644
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,559
but your family and friends still leak

645
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,960
it out you have the hard choice of

646
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,880
having a tough discussion with them or

647
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
not discussing

648
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,159
anything with them neither one's good

649
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
but it still gives you a better

650
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,679
optic for your safety than just letting

651
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,240
things go

652
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,480
getting into some of the more internet

653
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
of things i hate that acronym but here

654
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,280
we are the iot

655
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,280
i don't know how many people again this

656
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,559
is where i'd have people raise hands

657
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,559
back in the former world

658
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,799
if you've ever gone back and looked at a

659
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,320
ring doorbell recording

660
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,919
the uh 1080p the 4k quality is

661
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
phenomenal the audio visual

662
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,080
recording for these always on systems

663
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,679
i helped local police there was a car

664
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,760
crash two in the morning

665
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,200
local police aren't very technical they

666
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,279
asked me to get involved to help

667
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,240
with concurrence from the homeowner went

668
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,360
in and gathered the data

669
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,520
of the audio in the video we were able

670
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
to zone in and see the crash sequel

671
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,440
fleeing the scene joking about the drugs

672
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,679
they're on

673
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,600
and the point is with this

674
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,520
it's easy to add somebody to an access

675
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
control list to be able to watch this

676
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,919
but people don't think that to remove

677
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,240
the x whoever from the acl

678
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,520
just like you would at work if you're

679
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,279
going to put them on insider threat list

680
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:21,600
for

681
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,760
getting two weeks notice if you know

682
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,279
somebody's moving out

683
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,480
change your ring doorbell so that the x

684
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,039
doesn't have access to your new life

685
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,640
because with this ring doorbell they can

686
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
see someone new comes to the doorstep

687
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,159
police attorneys doesn't matter

688
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,480
couple that with amazon alex's ability

689
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,400
to record your and review your voice

690
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,279
history

691
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,880
all you have to do is go to amazon alexa

692
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,640
look at the url you can go through and

693
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,159
review every time you said hey alexa

694
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,000
you can see the smart history the voice

695
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
history

696
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,039
and knowing that if you have access to

697
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,640
this change your password

698
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
then you can disable the burglar alarm

699
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,159
you can disable a smoke alarm back in

700
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,200
2012 when

701
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,840
csi cyber first came on swift on

702
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,200
security and other people on twitter

703
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
were laughing about how

704
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,520
far-fetched and ridiculous csi cyber was

705
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,640
there's a murder case where someone

706
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,960
disabled the smoke alarm

707
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,080
then overheated the print jet on a laser

708
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
printer to cause a fire which caused a

709
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,679
murder that was ridiculous in 2012

710
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,159
now with amazon that's getting into the

711
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,080
realm of possibility

712
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,840
so again make sure you change your

713
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
username and password nsa doesn't have

714
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,440
the rights to watch

715
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
to have a listening audio device in your

716
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,240
house audio visual device

717
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,760
these are nice they're convenient but

718
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
they do give the opposition the ability

719
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,720
to see what's going on

720
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,919
in your house going from that on the

721
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,840
financial side i'm a certified

722
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,200
broad examiner former banker unless you

723
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,120
explicitly move the opposition

724
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,880
from the amazon account you might want

725
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,559
to close the joint account

726
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
remove your joint credit cards because

727
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,480
unless you explicitly remove the other

728
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,279
person

729
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,039
or your credit cards you are still

730
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,799
responsible they can max out your amazon

731
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,559
credit card

732
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,120
you're liable for it despite the fact

733
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,799
there's a divorce and process

734
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,960
you didn't remove them you implicitly

735
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
allowed this to go on

736
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
it's a financial risk but it can be

737
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,880
quite substantial

738
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
so moving a little bit here got a lot of

739
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,080
ground to cover thanks to the technical

740
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,559
issues on my side

741
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,679
on the printers a lot of microsoft based

742
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,600
printers or microsoft drivers will

743
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,159
retain

744
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,400
former printed files so if you still

745
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
have a laptop connected to a printer you

746
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,520
can go in and see the print

747
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,360
queue for that machine or cover those

748
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,200
on the offensive side you can see where

749
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,799
the person took your money where they're

750
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,919
going

751
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,760
the new apartment they've gone off to if

752
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,200
you're looking for them

753
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
defensively if you've left this behind

754
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,960
you don't want to leave a trace

755
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,600
it's easier to buy a new printer take

756
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,440
the laptop with you and replace them

757
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,279
if you have the ability then leave this

758
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,799
behind and recover the data the micro

759
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,559
the windows side if you go to

760
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,840
var school cups the

761
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,200
the principle here everything that

762
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,640
starts with c you can remove with

763
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,480
metadata the ones that start with d

764
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
double 0 1 6 0 0 1

765
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
you can drag and drop that file to your

766
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,840
desktop and view the pdf

767
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,919
the files that start with c all you have

768
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,840
to do is just run a simple strings query

769
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,440
against that file name and it's going to

770
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,200
pull out the header of it

771
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,559
i don't know if you guys can see it here

772
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,799
there we go

773
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,080
so this it's a coupon for world market

774
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,399
big deal someone got 25 off of something

775
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,399
that was marked up 125 percent anyway

776
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,240
big deal

777
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,760
but the example remains you can still

778
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
see the metadata of the files are

779
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,399
printed on this machine

780
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,840
which if you're leaving the abusive

781
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,640
situation and they can see

782
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,480
application for new job application for

783
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,840
new apartment

784
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,360
they can begin to piece together what's

785
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,200
going on with your life might want to

786
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,120
consider taking that laptop with you

787
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,880
getting into a little bit more nefarious

788
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
things for email mail pdf

789
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,760
social media tracking and this is not a

790
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
how to stalk somebody guide this is

791
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,720
a dual threat guy this how people are

792
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880
marketing companies are monitoring you

793
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,000
superhuman in the middle

794
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,960
gives you a marketing the ability to see

795
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,399
when the email was opened where it was

796
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,919
open and how often it was open there's

797
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,120
an embedded pixel in there

798
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,600
so you can see when they opened it where

799
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,120
they opened the pattern of life as they

800
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,399
traveled to open the

801
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,880
document which if you don't load remote

802
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,440
images

803
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,640
that's an easy thing to do for this

804
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,200
for b-side san antonio yes we understand

805
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,440
that for the average user that might be

806
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,080
something

807
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
not aware of this is a vector that could

808
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,679
be done

809
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
gmail has also added this feature to see

810
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,799
where this email has been opened

811
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,120
couple that with docs in for outlook and

812
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,840
there's embedded code within the pdf

813
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,679
which beacons back to tell them how long

814
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,399
the file was opened where it was opened

815
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,919
what pages were open where they spent

816
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,520
the most time and what pages were

817
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,559
skipped for corporate discussions if he

818
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,120
knew that

819
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,000
page four had the most sensitive data

820
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,360
that you're most concerned about the

821
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,559
opposition

822
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,159
negotiating against you and you knew

823
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,399
they skipped over it versus their

824
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,640
they keep coming back to page four

825
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,559
you've got insight as to what they're

826
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,399
doing

827
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,559
on the domestic abuse side i know she

828
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,080
read this document i know he read this

829
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,720
document he was here when they read it

830
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,039
they're getting blue force tracking

831
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,559
level detail as to what you're doing

832
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,840
with this document where it is

833
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,240
on a mac go to terminal type in mdls

834
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,360
metadata list drag and drop that pdf

835
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,240
hit enter and you'll see the cookie the

836
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,440
beacon that part comes from

837
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,520
cloudfront.net in this case

838
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,279
and you can see the data we spent

839
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,440
several hours at the nato soft classroom

840
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,880
looking to replicate this with the

841
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,279
troops

842
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,799
and i'm looking for somebody come back

843
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,720
and say here's a simple way to do it

844
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,159
coming before an audience of this

845
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,760
technical acumen

846
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,200
we have not identified an easy way

847
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,039
on windows machines to show that this

848
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,799
has a beacon that somebody's tracking

849
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,440
when you open this file

850
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,120
and the easy way to mitigate this

851
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,240
is to freaking print it it's very basic

852
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,679
very simple you get the document you

853
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,320
print it

854
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,080
there's no tracking for printed paper

855
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
that's very simple

856
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
you might kill a tree but you have your

857
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,960
privacy that's a little bit better in

858
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,760
these situations

859
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
coming back to the real world this is

860
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,080
something there's a little bit of ground

861
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,559
swell

862
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,720
to push back on the u.s post office

863
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,480
informed delivery if you have the right

864
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,000
credentials the right post-op

865
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,279
excuse me the right driver's license if

866
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,480
you're leaving

867
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,760
knowing you're leaving your abusive

868
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,000
victim you can

869
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,240
get man in the middle i'm sorry informed

870
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,840
delivery that's what they officially

871
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,640
call it

872
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,600
it's going to let you see the pdf or

873
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,559
jpeg

874
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,720
of every document being delivered to

875
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,559
that po not po box

876
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,399
post office box or mailbox

877
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,279
worst case scenario uh letters from

878
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,000
attorneys

879
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,559
checks summons to court sensitive

880
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,000
documents if you know those are going in

881
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,679
the mailbox tomorrow

882
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,880
you pull the one document out or in 2020

883
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,080
if you don't like the way the other

884
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,600
person's voting and they have

885
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,120
a absentee ballot coming you remove that

886
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,039
ballot you removed their abilities to

887
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,080
vote

888
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,960
that's a different level of felony but

889
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,039
it's still the same capability

890
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,960
the only way right now that the victim

891
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
would know that man-in-the-middle

892
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
informed delivery has been enabled

893
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,320
either afa choose to enable informed

894
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,840
delivery themselves and find it's

895
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,120
already enabled

896
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,760
or b if they go to the post office and

897
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
physically ask if this is enabled on

898
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,559
their po box

899
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,440
depending on a lot of factors people

900
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,799
don't want to go to a

901
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,120
post office and have physical

902
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,480
interaction right now this is a major

903
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,760
vulnerability and something

904
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
to look out for during these abusive

905
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,399
situations

906
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,760
a couple other things uh audiences have

907
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,600
had me add into this

908
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,799
icat on google calendars so if you have

909
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,519
something like

910
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,279
tripit uh concur

911
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,840
or even webinars like this you add it to

912
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,760
your shared calendar and you forget to

913
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,600
remove the other person from your shared

914
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,880
calendar

915
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,360
they're going to have your itinerary

916
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,200
they're going to have your confirmation

917
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,039
your seat number if somebody was truly

918
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,000
malicious

919
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
that they could call the airline call

920
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,399
the hotel this is so-and-so calling

921
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,200
for john smith here's his confirmation

922
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,159
number i want to

923
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,720
uh cancel it do a cross-country trip

924
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,679
assuming we ever fly again

925
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,200
and you get there there's no hotel

926
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,120
waiting for you because it was canceled

927
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,799
it's simple just remember just like it

928
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,320
worked just like in the sock you want to

929
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,799
call the acl for somebody departing

930
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,360
even down to your trip at your concur

931
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,200
your shared calendars so that this can't

932
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,159
happen to you or the victim

933
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,559
now social media stalking let's take

934
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,760
another time

935
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,000
belarus 1 14 a.m 1 15 a.m from hawaii

936
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,080
115 from kingdom saudi arabia

937
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,559
and when i was working with nato you can

938
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
see it's uh

939
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,760
saudi arabia moscow islam uh

940
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,919
iran we know this isn't real it's not

941
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,880
possible to travel that far this quickly

942
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,480
that's obviously not true but what is

943
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,039
true if you go to tnfoleak.com

944
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,799
you can see all these suites were posted

945
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,200
between iphone

946
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
and the web application which means this

947
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,480
twitter account has an

948
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,399
iphone you can begin to use that to

949
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,000
reverse engineer to send a malicious

950
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,840
payload to try to hack back into their

951
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,640
phone that's

952
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,799
inadvertent disclosure of vulnerability

953
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,960
just because part of this means it's not

954
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,080
true doesn't mean it's all

955
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,320
doesn't mean it's all bad information

956
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,840
you know the gru gq

957
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,480
he recommends you signal used for i'd

958
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,359
say assume your devices are compromised

959
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,639
uh programs that are meant for

960
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,879
you know monitoring your child's use of

961
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,599
technology flexispy for monitoring

962
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,320
smartphones

963
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,359
if it's an android phone they would send

964
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,119
you a link a phishing link you click on

965
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:31,918
the link

966
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,800
and now your phone can be cloned by a

967
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,239
flexi spy and they can see what you're

968
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,159
doing

969
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,800
if you have a iphone we'll touch on that

970
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,000
in a second get a little bit ahead of

971
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,399
myself

972
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,560
so assuming your meetings assuming your

973
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,000
electronics are compromised until you

974
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,679
know they're good use personal meetings

975
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,440
leave your electronics behind somewhere

976
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,960
routine and secure if you work at a

977
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,760
vet's office

978
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,839
leave your phone at the vet's office go

979
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,280
have your meeting with your attorney

980
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,720
with your family

981
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,160
come back to where the phone is the

982
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,839
stalker wouldn't know

983
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,079
have a non-verbal parole for family

984
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,320
members like

985
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,680
if you're a big ohio state fan

986
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
and you wear a michigan shirt on your

987
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,000
facebook profile one day as the signal

988
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,720
saying

989
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,119
there's something wrong please come get

990
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:17,920
me

991
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
you've sent your beacon for help out no

992
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,119
one else aside

993
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,560
from those who would know what this

994
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,720
means would know that

995
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
we need to go get jane something's going

996
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,280
on so this is something you would have

997
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,000
arranged a physical meeting without any

998
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,800
electronic signature

999
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,240
the iphone monitoring for flexispy

1000
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,520
again change your password and somebody

1001
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,440
who does digital forensics when they say

1002
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,640
that

1003
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
this is iphone monitoring it kind of

1004
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,079
pisses me off a little bit because it's

1005
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,359
inaccurate

1006
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,119
what flexi spy does a provides v the red

1007
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,160
screen is like the

1008
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,480
big emphasis points for defcon or other

1009
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,359
conferences for

1010
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,200
this is the core of take this away this

1011
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,040
is hands-on this is useful information

1012
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,079
please

1013
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,119
implement this so for the iphone

1014
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,079
monitoring

1015
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,359
alice provides bob's mac id and password

1016
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,520
to mspy

1017
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,359
bob's iphone now has to be synced to the

1018
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,720
cloud to create a backup

1019
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
there's a lot of ifs here already and

1020
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
then m-spy downloads and images and

1021
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,920
parses the data into report for alex

1022
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,400
that's not hacking that's just you've

1023
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,680
got someone's password and you're

1024
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,000
getting

1025
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,119
a copy of their phone which

1026
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,839
again all you do is change your password

1027
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,480
in this

1028
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,680
scenario for the stalker wear meant to

1029
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,720
monitor children

1030
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,960
the stalker wear is rendered useless so

1031
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,880
again change your password again be

1032
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,240
thorough and persistent with this

1033
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,240
i've got a couple of new advances i like

1034
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,320
this trapping your device

1035
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
and all the travels i used to do for cia

1036
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,680
and a lot of travel i do for a

1037
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,520
revolutionary security i use sleep

1038
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,960
cycles on my phone that uses the

1039
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,800
potentiometer on your phone to see how

1040
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
well you sleep in a certain

1041
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,280
bed type you know some hotels have this

1042
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,079
brand mattress some have

1043
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,760
serta some have a sleep number whatever

1044
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,359
and you can see where you sleep the best

1045
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,800
in what conditions so when it's time for

1046
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,240
a new mattress

1047
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,760
you know what works for you or just

1048
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
general fitness whatever

1049
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,599
but the same technology can be dual

1050
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,480
purpose so that it's on your phone

1051
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,000
so you can see if you're sleeping in the

1052
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,200
middle of the night your phone is picked

1053
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,640
up and someone's looking at it you can

1054
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,680
see there's a spike

1055
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,880
at 3am someone touched your phone

1056
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,320
a couple of that if your phone's on top

1057
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
of your bug out bag you can see someone

1058
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,680
not only moved your phone they went

1059
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,720
through your bag

1060
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,800
you've got a clue an indicator that

1061
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,839
there's something wrong you've been

1062
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,320
compromised

1063
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,599
this is new i love this so you go to

1064
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,880
settings on your iphone you go to

1065
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,800
battery

1066
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,359
your battery charge level and then you

1067
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,560
can start to drill down

1068
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,680
hour by hour and see what applications

1069
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,760
were open so at 3 am if you see your

1070
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,079
imessages your twitter

1071
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,839
your signal had been active when you

1072
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,359
were sound asleep you know someone is

1073
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,720
definitely going through your phone

1074
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,119
there's something going on that's a huge

1075
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,760
indicator of compromise

1076
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,280
and this is built into the software

1077
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
there's nothing you can do about it

1078
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,520
you can't disable it this is native to

1079
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,320
the ios now

1080
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,960
so a smart excuse me a secure clean

1081
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,359
machine

1082
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,079
the apple operating system has recovery

1083
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,240
partition built in you hold down control

1084
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,880
r and go to get help online for a issue

1085
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,280
with your machine

1086
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,440
a little bit of serendipity here that

1087
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,119
get help online if you're reaching out

1088
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:41,880
to

1089
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,920
safeascape.org or if you're reaching out

1090
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,240
to an attorney family friends

1091
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,079
you're operating off a partition of the

1092
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,560
mac that malware can't reach at this

1093
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
point knock on wood

1094
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,359
so control r go online and unless you've

1095
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,119
got somebody who's very technical

1096
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,960
running splunk on your home network and

1097
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,320
then running cali

1098
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,160
to in a wire chart to see what you're

1099
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,000
doing

1100
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,480
you've got a clean way that they can't

1101
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,079
touch the keystrokes for this and see

1102
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,680
what you're doing with your machine

1103
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,440
to get help online it leaves no trace on

1104
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,200
this it goes back to a pristine state

1105
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,119
every time you come back in

1106
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,200
so that's just command r on startup and

1107
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,440
go to get help online built into mac

1108
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,920
wasn't the original purpose of apple but

1109
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,880
it definitely works

1110
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
so this touch the social media we've got

1111
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,000
about 17 minutes left

1112
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,760
i've got to kick it up a speed here you

1113
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,200
found a device in your

1114
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,640
living room electronic surveillance

1115
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,280
device

1116
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,079
insulation isn't you know dsmp anymore

1117
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,560
it's not

1118
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,920
director of science technology you don't

1119
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,160
have to take years of training it's as

1120
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,040
simple as this

1121
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,200
you have power you have media

1122
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,160
and now you have the audio video storage

1123
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,359
bug with ac

1124
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,000
power available from amazon

1125
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,160
the triad here is you have power

1126
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,680
collection and storage

1127
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,200
if you're going to have constant

1128
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,359
collection beaming out audio video

1129
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,200
you're going to have to go straight to

1130
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,640
the cloud which means ac

1131
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,319
power or you're going to have

1132
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,160
limitations on that power

1133
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,560
because you can only run that battery so

1134
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,000
long till it dies which requires

1135
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,640
physical collection

1136
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
if you're doing intermittent collection

1137
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,160
without much power

1138
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,760
you can have more storage you see how

1139
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,720
the three play off of each other

1140
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,400
all these devices are available from

1141
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
amazon you would think this is something

1142
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,520
you're getting from

1143
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,760
20 years ago be something you classified

1144
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,800
but now it's

1145
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,640
suggested through amazon thanks to

1146
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,078
researching for these presentations

1147
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,440
this is a 1080p hd camera

1148
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,400
audio video but because the power

1149
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,280
limitation

1150
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,359
power draw has to be connected to the

1151
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,359
power ac power of a house

1152
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,960
connects to your router remember earlier

1153
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,480
i showed you this router screen

1154
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,240
this would show the clock is connected

1155
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,200
to the router one it's 2020 who uses

1156
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,399
physical clocks anymore

1157
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,960
the mitigation for this a new clock

1158
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,040
appears unplug it put it away

1159
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,400
boom easy solved now you might want to

1160
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,680
document this for

1161
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,800
your attorney for later or law

1162
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,480
enforcement is definitely a felony you

1163
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,359
can't have

1164
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,680
monitoring of somebody in your house you

1165
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,920
can check your local law stuff

1166
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,119
the air freshener 720p camera audio

1167
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,319
video

1168
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,560
runs up a battery stores to a smart car

1169
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,480
that requires physical access to change

1170
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,520
this

1171
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,040
the usb drive you flip the switch one

1172
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,599
way the

1173
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,440
curved notch one way it's uh

1174
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,240
continuous recording for 128 hours put

1175
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,920
the notch the other way it's short burst

1176
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,079
recording of up to 128 hours

1177
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,920
the difference is one you're only

1178
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,400
getting somebody talking versus 120

1179
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,040
hours of

1180
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,480
parsing through the tape so these are

1181
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,560
different ways that if somebody's

1182
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,520
excuse me still monitoring you they can

1183
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,680
collect against you but

1184
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,760
these would require physical collection

1185
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,920
so in a domestic abuse situation ex

1186
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,599
situation where the kids are going back

1187
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,359
and forth

1188
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,520
you have the perfect vehicle you have a

1189
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,040
camera in here

1190
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,400
microphone battery and limited storage

1191
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,920
so that when the bear goes back to the

1192
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,680
x's house they can switch out the

1193
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,560
battery they can switch out the usb

1194
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,880
sd card what have you and they have

1195
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,960
insight for what happened with the kids

1196
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,359
while they are at the x's or the teddy

1197
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,560
bear goes in mom or dad's office

1198
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
and the teddy bear in one case was used

1199
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,240
to shoulder surf gather passwords for

1200
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,480
the stalking case which eventually got

1201
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,640
referred to law enforcement but you have

1202
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,440
to think why is this being brought here

1203
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,079
why is this coming and going and here's

1204
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,920
how i'm vulnerable these are not hard

1205
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,800
devices

1206
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,240
to detect once you know what you're

1207
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,119
looking for the one caveat if you do

1208
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,280
have an electrician who wires

1209
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,960
audio video monitoring into a house

1210
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,720
surfaceously

1211
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,640
that's a different level of monitoring

1212
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,480
law enforcement's definitely interested

1213
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,839
that would get someone some

1214
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,000
free meals for the next 10 to 15 years

1215
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,319
apple means well they really do another

1216
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,839
case we found with electronic

1217
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:22,640
surveillance

1218
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,319
is turning the ear pods and using those

1219
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,079
as hearing aids all that would take is

1220
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,000
leaving the ios device in the

1221
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,800
in one room enabling the hearing aid

1222
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,560
option on the iphone which is native to

1223
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,240
ios now

1224
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,880
and the abuser can be in the other room

1225
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,560
with the

1226
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,599
air pods on but using it as a hearing

1227
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,480
aid and they

1228
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,000
actually use that as a remote listening

1229
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,680
device to the conversation

1230
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,839
two or three doors away two or three

1231
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:50,800
rooms away

1232
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
something else to consider why do they

1233
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,800
formerly take their phone with them all

1234
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,760
the time

1235
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,280
now they leave the phone behind but they

1236
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,760
leave the earpods and that's odd

1237
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,280
this might be what's going on your

1238
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,680
privacy's at risk

1239
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,359
bluetooth collection if you run

1240
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,520
something like net toolbox you can run a

1241
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,000
bluetooth

1242
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,599
scan to see what's in the house to see

1243
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,119
if there's any bluetooth collection

1244
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,880
confirm if there's anything rogue in the

1245
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,560
device like the teddy bear like the

1246
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,160
alarm clock if they're using that as the

1247
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,240
x-fil channel

1248
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
and bluetooth is promiscuous so once

1249
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,160
it's in that p list it's not hard for an

1250
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,960
investigator

1251
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,240
to uh p-list is a method it's the list

1252
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,599
of all the devices that are ever

1253
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,280
connected to

1254
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,000
kind of like a database if you will so

1255
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,880
you can see

1256
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,800
this device with this bluetooth address

1257
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,119
this mac address was placed into service

1258
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,319
two days after this fight and i've been

1259
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,200
monitored

1260
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,880
that store on your phone for perpetuity

1261
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,640
that's easy evidence for the police to

1262
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,000
gather

1263
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,599
coming into the home stretch the

1264
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,520
physical tracking you can actually buy a

1265
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
bug off of amazon goes on

1266
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,520
underneath someone's car it's 50 or 25

1267
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,440
dollars a month it looks like an old

1268
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,119
cellular modem

1269
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,640
and they mark it at four spouses

1270
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,160
and it gives you a collection like this

1271
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,680
where you can actually see where the car

1272
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,119
is gone

1273
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,960
which is really cool except if i tell

1274
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,880
you that i lied to you this isn't really

1275
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,160
collection from a

1276
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,880
bug this is collection from gps data

1277
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,800
from a facebook from a phone from a case

1278
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,240
i was working

1279
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,680
the gps data was put on google maps as a

1280
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,880
kml file i don't need a beacon if i have

1281
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,720
access to your facebook or your phone

1282
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,839
and can rip that file out with the gps

1283
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,079
locations

1284
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,160
you have a bug you have to change your

1285
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,920
password so someone doesn't have access

1286
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,400
to your devices

1287
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,079
very simple fitness because a lot of

1288
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,560
people like the gopros

1289
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,640
not the gopros you have fitments the

1290
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,319
fitness trackers they connected to their

1291
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,400
twitter they advertised their runs where

1292
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,000
they've been there's a murder case in

1293
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,880
san francisco

1294
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,560
where it was someone was arrested

1295
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,880
because their

1296
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,880
fitbit was beaconing out their daily run

1297
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,240
which coincided with the murder i like

1298
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,280
having dumb criminal

1299
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,480
that makes jobs easier but

1300
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,079
if you're worried about being stalked or

1301
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,839
the person who comes to you for help is

1302
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,839
worried about being stopped

1303
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,839
as a mentor for besides vegas said stop

1304
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,480
it stop

1305
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,240
wearing your beacon stop advertising

1306
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,599
where you're going it's that simple to

1307
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,960
mitigate this risk just

1308
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
the world can live without knowing

1309
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,960
susie's run they don't need to know that

1310
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,119
bob went to crossfit

1311
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,960
and then ran for three miles nobody if

1312
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,240
you're worried about being trapped get

1313
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,280
rid of the tracker

1314
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,160
very simple

1315
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,000
all right well again this is too much

1316
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,560
i'm gonna order a pizza be persistent

1317
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,760
and thorough when i was getting this

1318
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,720

and i saw that not only was my address

1322
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,440
here my phone number my credit card

1323
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,160
stored

1324
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,400
my past two years of credit my past few

1325
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,000
years of pizza orders had been

1326
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,640
stored on there

1327
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,480
so if your person coming to you for help

1328
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,400
orders pizza every thursday night

1329
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,119
and the abuser knows this it's easy to

1330
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,480
see where they're going for their safe

1331
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,240
house to get away from the abuser

1332
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,440
change all the passwords

1333
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,280
all right we are in the home stretch a

1334
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,040
little bit happier it's a heavy subject

1335
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,880
thanks for sticking through me

1336
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,160
identity theft very simple if you're in

1337
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,319
the u.s go to identity theft.gov and

1338
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,839
report it

1339
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,240
in the fraud triangle divorce abuse

1340
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,119
situations

1341
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,280
you have the rationale rationalization

1342
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,319
of well

1343

1344
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,640

1345
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,839
going to divorce me

1346
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,359

1347
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,880
checks i've got their credit card i've

1348
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,559
got a copy of the passport

1349
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,079
i'm going to be divorced and won't have

1350
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,400
their income but they owe me

1351
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,839
a narcissist can go down this path of

1352
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,839
self-justified

1353
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,680
there's things like spoof card you're

1354
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,240
going through a divorce situation

1355
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,440
you put in citibank's phone number you

1356
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,880
call the target someone else calls the

1357
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,760
target

1358
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,280
you know we understand these charges are

1359
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,880
going through

1360
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,319
we just need to verify a b or c it looks

1361
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,000
like it's a correct situation

1362
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,599
it's really the abuser coming back in

1363
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,440
just feel a little bit more before the

1364
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,599
case is over

1365
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,599
your guard has to be up for fraud so you

1366
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,079
go to identity theft.gov

1367
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,520
you get a ftc federal trade commission

1368
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,040
case number they work with you they work

1369
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,119
with the banks to report this

1370
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,880
and it's very binary if there's identity

1371
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,520
theft

1372
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,040
you have to report it if you don't

1373
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,640
report it that means you're complicit

1374
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,520
that means

1375
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,280
you are okay with what they've done to

1376
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,119
you and you don't really have the longer

1377
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,160
it goes after this has happened

1378
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,920
the less of a chance the courts and the

1379
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,559
banks will work with you again very

1380
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,440
binary

1381
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,760
the technical means am i being monitored

1382
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,599
is somebody stalking me digitally

1383
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,920
are they into my account yes that's very

1384
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,200
complex there's a lot of different

1385
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,640
venues we touched on

1386
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,040
identity theft either report it or don't

1387
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,079
if you don't report it

1388
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,839
that's on you there's nothing else we

1389
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,760
can do for you to be blunt

1390
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,359
if you do report it that goes to the ftc

1391
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,520
the consumer commission and you've got a

1392
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,839
lot of large corporations that will help

1393
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:14,559
you

1394
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,160
even if you go to the police with this

1395
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,000
and say this has happened they're going

1396
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
to send you to identity theft.gov on a

1397
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,319
clean machine

1398
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,160
to report this so the sooner you report

1399
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,839
this the better

1400
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,200
lastly we're getting into data

1401
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,960
availability we talked about controlling

1402
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,599
environment

1403
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,880
identity that the last data availability

1404
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,680
this thing used to be if it ain't cable

1405
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,280
traffic it ain't

1406
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,960
if it ain't documented if they if you

1407
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,800
don't write down dates times events when

1408
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,319
they happen whether it's just an email

1409
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,319
to yourself

1410
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,480
an email to an attorney to a friend if

1411
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,839
it doesn't have that header for the

1412
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,520
metadata the daytime stamp of you

1413
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,559
reporting this

1414
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,160
it doesn't matter so documentation

1415
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,319
that's hard that's

1416
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,720
when you're working a ida case an

1417
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,800
intrusion case

1418
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,240
a digital forensic case domestic abuse

1419
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,200
broadcast

1420
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,240
if you don't document it it doesn't

1421
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,680
happen

1422
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,599
you've got to document these dates times

1423
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,359
and events with authorities

1424
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,079
document the files i found this event on

1425
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,440
this date and here's what

1426
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,280
do it as it occurs you know this like

1427
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,880
saying style practice

1428
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,960
if you don't document when it occurs

1429
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,640
you're going to have a backlash

1430
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,800
of files to document later and good luck

1431
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,920
with that

1432
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,359
might come from firsthand experience i

1433
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,280
can't say that for sure the other thing

1434
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,359
about availability on the soft skill

1435
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,119
be available for the other person this

1436
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,960
isn't a

1437
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,559
pims ticket that comes into your queue

1438
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,079
this isn't a help desk ticket

1439
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,839
a uh incident that comes in through

1440
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,680
cable traffic however you get your alert

1441
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,040
to work

1442
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,640
this is a person coming to you after

1443
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,960
hours with a live situation they can't

1444
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,800
walk out of this and walk home this is

1445
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,240
their life

1446
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,920
be available if they want to talk listen

1447
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,359
if they want to go out for to eat if

1448
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,000
they can

1449
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,680
you're part of the world do it be

1450
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,119
available for the other person they're

1451
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,160
going through some hard times and

1452
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,400
they come to you for help be there for

1453
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,599
them

1454
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,599
because it's eventually going to end and

1455
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,960
they're going to remember how people are

1456
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,880
treated so

1457
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,000
be a good person for this you know it

1458
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,520
sounds a little bit silly to say but we

1459
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,119
get so lost in the ones and zeros

1460
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,640
sometimes that we forget that the ones

1461
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,240
and zeros are data that goes back to

1462
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,760
someone's life that we're helping them

1463
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,280
rebuild

1464
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,880
to defragment and

1465
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,119
it's a necessary thing the data

1466
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,800
availability the data that you find

1467
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,920
whether it's

1468
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,359
that printer queue we talked about

1469
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,119
whether it's documents that have beacons

1470
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,520
embedded

1471
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
that's the only copy this isn't some

1472
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,119
multi-trillion a billion dollar

1473
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,720
corporation

1474
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,720
i recommend for the pace plan you have a

1475
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,280
primary and alternate a contingency copy

1476
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,079
an emergency copy

1477
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,680
personally i like to make four copies

1478
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,160
have one stored in a safe deposit box

1479
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,480
one with an attorney one with a branch

1480
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,920
chief division chief

1481
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,800
law enforcement doesn't matter you have

1482
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,079
a copy you're working from

1483
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,800
but the primary is locked away that way

1484
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,520
eve

1485
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,640
murphy happens it's the unthinkable just

1486
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,920
like the beginning of the presentation

1487
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,200
where i think controlling mouse and

1488
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,400
keyboard

1489
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,920
it happens bad things are going to

1490
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,160
happen to data so you want to make sure

1491
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,599
that these files you got redundant

1492
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,319
copies

1493
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,800
stored in multiple locations so that you

1494
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,640
can help this person rebuild their lives

1495
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,640
four minutes left firm friendly final

1496
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,319
and fair a little bit of social

1497
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,200
engineering here

1498
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,160
as we approach the in-game if you say i

1499
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,599
don't want to be on your cell phone plan

1500
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,040
anymore because i think you're stalking

1501
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,319
me that's going to be a hostile reaction

1502
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,800
if you say or the other person says you

1503
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,839
know things are getting a little bit

1504
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:44,240
tough

1505
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,880
i've got this new job i've got my own

1506
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,680
cell phone

1507
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,920
lie no one's gonna say anything lie a

1508
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,839
little bit i've got my new cell phone

1509
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,240
plan

1510
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,000
through work you know here's my new

1511
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,319
number you don't have to pay for this

1512
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,160
anymore it's going to lower your bill

1513
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,280
you put a little bit of a carrot and

1514
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,000
stick out there

1515
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,400
of benefit to them you no longer have to

1516
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,760
pay that extra forty dollars a month

1517
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,040
that's one money in your pocket isn't

1518
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,160
that great

1519
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,920
but you've still removed them from

1520
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,079
access to your call data records access

1521
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,559
to your text

1522
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,680
and because of this it's the same in

1523
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,200
game

1524
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,920
both not a little bit it's a lot

1525
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,880
smoother ending

1526
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,079
for the same outcome another thing for

1527
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,400
the outcome to touch on

1528
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,720
if this does get to law enforcement that

1529
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,119
we as the infosec community has helped

1530
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,880
have been helping assisting the abuse

1531
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,240
victim

1532
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,160
we're going to be considered the guy or

1533
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,280
the gal

1534
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,000
whatever and the black hoodie the hacker

1535
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,680
who's doing this militia's activity we

1536
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,920
have to be beyond reproaching this

1537
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,280
even though you might know how to hack

1538
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,960
into somebody's whatever account

1539
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,000
we definitely can't in general i

1540
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,200
shouldn't say that supposed to be

1541
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,119
hackers elite haha but

1542
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,720
you don't want to get involved and go to

1543
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,319
jail for someone else's domestic

1544
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,720
dispute be beyond reproaching this

1545
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,319
a little bit of humor to close this out

1546
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,200
shared technology in a domestic conflict

1547
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,200
one device had strong encryption strong

1548
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,800
authentication

1549
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,079
wasn't leaked and

1550
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,000
wasn't able to share any secrets the

1551
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,760
other device weak encryption

1552
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,480
and the device was white how fast of a

1553
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,559
movie with star wars have been if c-3po

1554
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,720

1555
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,760
oh that's who my dad was 30 minutes in

1556
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,240
the movie game over

1557
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,599
and george lucas would have lost

1558
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,119
millions and trillions of dollars on

1559
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,680
merchandise revenue

1560

00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,200
this network he did a live memory

1564
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,319
forensic analysis

1565
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,280

unauthorized device in his network

1576
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,839
unaware that

1577
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,000
