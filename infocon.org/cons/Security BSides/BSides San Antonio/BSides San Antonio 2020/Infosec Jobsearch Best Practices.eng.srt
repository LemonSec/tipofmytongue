1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,679
here we are uh b-side san antonio

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,640
i will tell you um real quick that when

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,000
i started submitting for

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
2020 when i was submitting talks i

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,920
specifically um

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,360
had a talk with my boss i was like can i

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,240
do a bunch of talks this year and

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,119
they're like yeah we support you um

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,760
and i chose all the locations that i

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,520
really want to go to

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,160
so i wish i was actually there as i'm

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,560
sure

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,279
all of you do as well uh however

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,199
the forces of the universe have decided

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,479
that today

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,440
my air conditioning doesn't work so it's

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
almost like i'm there

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,640
because it's like 85 degrees

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
in my office so yay um but anyway

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,480
i when i submitted the talk i call the

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,239
best practices and then

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
i'm saying but i still need a job

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
because of everything that we're going

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,399
through right now

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,559
so

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,000
okay so we will go through a little bit

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,480
um

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,760
talking about um

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,438
not just the challenges that we're

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,880
facing right now

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
but also um the just the fundamentals

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,560
that i that i typically talk about so

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,640
when i built the talk initially

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
uh all of the crazy stuff that we're

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
going through wasn't going on

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
um and so i had to switch up my slides

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,280
at the last

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
you know um last few

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
weeks i was like well let's let's change

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,320
this up so that's relevant to what we're

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
all going through now and then we'll go

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,159
through

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,799
some of the fundamentals as well to

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,600
include

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,560

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,600
negotiating

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
but also let's talk about what we're all

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,280

recently

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
plus a handful of other b-sides

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
a little random tidbit about me um i

74

like to run ultramarathons you don't

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
know an ultra marathon is anything

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,640
longer than a marathon i've done

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
13 of them in 10 years um

78

i have watched lots of murdery things um

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:54,800
so

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
i i've heard and you all if you've been

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,519
in track 3 very much today you've

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,920
heard a lot of different career based

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,879
perspectives

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,920
and opinions and advice that's all super

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,560
valuable

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,360
and all different perspectives um

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,800
nothing is right or wrong

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
um frank just said something amazing

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
that i i feel like you took it right out

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
of my handbook because

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,599
um i'm going to talk about how we can

94
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
pivot and what you need to do to do that

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,120
and if you didn't hear what he said it

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,159
was amazing

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,920
if it's being if it's being recorded you

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
should go back and listen to it but it's

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,400
about

100
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,280
um identifying that just having a

101
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,319
willingness and an

102
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
ability to do something is the number

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
one qualifier so

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
i die on that hill um that was an

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,599
amazing thing for him to say

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
so that's me that's a little cartoon to

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,760
me

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
and it's just letting you know it's a

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,959
little game board

110
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,879
um i've i am a hiring manager i

111
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,720
have been a recruiter and i've been a

112
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
candidate uh in the course of my career

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,599
so

114
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,879
i'm coming to you with how i

115
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
uh view things from all of those

116
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,480
perspectives

117
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
so again things are a little bit crazy

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,519
right now right

119
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,760
we're all adjusting we're all adapting

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,439
we're all dealing with it

121
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,920
um i think that we can take this like

122
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,599
any other challenge

123
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,798
and we can um

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
we can say well how can we use this to

125
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,800
our advantage one thing you can do

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
to use uh the current circumstances

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,759
to your advantage is you can notice

128
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
um how the prospective employers

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
are are treating the candidates um

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
how flexible are they how accommodating

131
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,840
are they

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
um and and ask yourself well

133
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
in my day-to-day life um as

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,639
a human like every other human things

135
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
come up you know things in my personal

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
life things in my family

137
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,840
 happens right so how accommodating

138
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,000
will

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
this company be to me

140
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
as an employee if they if they can't

141
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
work with me to to make the interview

142
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,680
work or

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,919
uh to be flexible all throughout the

144
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
candidate experience um

145
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
one of the one my specific brand um

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
wouldn't mind if they put this on my

147
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,320
tombstone i i believe in the candidate

148
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,960
experience i believe in the value

149
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,000
of the way we treat people is really

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
what matters right so every person

151
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,759
that for the people who aren't

152
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,440
candidates or who are candidates and

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
potential employers listening to this

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,160
every person you want to hire someone

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,560
else

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
also wants to hire them so think about

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,080
that

158
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,199
uh through the candidate experience on

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,560
how you're contributing to it how you're

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
behaving in the interview

161
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
how you're treating those people who

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,000
have many other choices

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,280
typically think about

164
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
how they're being treated um so that can

165
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,080
be very revealing to you at this time

166
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,600
who's ahead of the curve who's doing the

167
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
kind of things frank was talking about

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
where they're willing to invest in

169
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
people and train people and that sort of

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,360
thing

171
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,240
and notice that you know what um i don't

172
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,880
have this

173
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,919
or this or this experience but um but

174
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,199
here's what i have done

175
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
and here's the way i think and here's

176
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,479
how i solve problems

177
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,880
and here's what i'm willing to do uh if

178
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
you would give me the opportunity

179
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,759
so before um

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,520
so at the end of 2019 i started doing

181
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,720
little mini surveys

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,759
on twitter and i and i did them

183
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,479
knowing that i had submitted talks and

184
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,120
and that

185
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,800
um and i wanted to go through these

186
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
basic fundamentals

187
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,880
uh in those talks and so i think i did

188
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,479
three or four surveys

189
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240
and it's not scientific data because i

190
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
think there's a certain number of people

191
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
that have to respond to it before it's

192
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,880
actually considered

193
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
i don't think tens of thousands of

194
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,319
people responded it was in the hundreds

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,680
for sure but

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,280
um i i was not surprised that most

197
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
people are passive

198
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
so understand that as you hear all the

199
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,360
things in track three today and all the

200
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
things from your peers and your mentors

201
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,000
and all the advice and

202
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
all the best-selling books and all of

203
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
the experts that tell you

204
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
you know how to be a good candidate how

205
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
to find the perfect job um

206
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,520
know that you will take those and you

207
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
will you will

208
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,680
use them in a toolbox that makes sense

209
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,639
for you

210
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,840
at your specific stage of candidacy um

211
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
and that may be that you're actively

212
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
looking let's face it

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
most of us need a job you need a job

214
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
because we'll be bored or we need a job

215
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
to keep the lights on

216
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,479
um so you're going to

217
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,240
look at your job search in different

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
ways um

219
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
another thing that frank mentioned i

220
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
obviously really enjoyed his talk um

221
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
was uh something with regard to was a

222
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,879
statistic

223
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,440
as to how long it actually takes to find

224
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,319
a job

225
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
um and it was very interesting um but

226
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,759
obviously if you're always looking or at

227
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,319
least

228
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,599
open to hearing about uh positions while

229
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,879
you're currently employed

230
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,400
if you have that opportunity if you're

231
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,680
fortunate enough to look in that

232
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,639
situation

233
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,680
it's more ideal um i can

234
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
say that my last two jobs including my

235
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,919
current job

236
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,039
wasn't looking for a job um when i was

237
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,720
made aware of the position

238
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,240
um so it's a good a better

239
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,840
uh position to be in um so we're not all

240
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,680
in the same stage at different points

241
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,399
in the in our candidacy stuff happens

242
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,679
like i said earlier

243
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,240
and something out of your control might

244
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,719
occur

245
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,719
and then you find yourself looking for a

246
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,399
job and you weren't expecting it or

247
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
maybe you're just not loving what you're

248
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
doing that's a good time to

249
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
just start peeking around and talking to

250
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
your peers and finding out what's out

251
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,920
there

252
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
um dork vader did say that i could quote

253
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,959
him

254
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,959
when he responded i believe this survey

255
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,040
he he commented that uh

256
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
no better time to be looking than it's

257
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
just really good basic career hygiene

258
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,360
to be always um at least leave the door

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,839
open

260
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,720
so um here's the sorts of things

261
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
that we're facing in the interviews um

262
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
hopefully i provide halfway decent

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
examples i'm definitely not following

264
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,560
all the things on this list right now um

265
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
but when you're doing your virtual

266
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,560
interview uh there's a lot of challenges

267
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
that you're going to be facing

268
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
um it's really really important to test

269
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
the tech

270
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
i just happen to be the person who when

271
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
we were testing all the speakers

272
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,160
uh my camera wouldn't work i had a

273
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,360
long story i had to run out and get some

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,839
equipment but um so test it test it

275
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,600
always test it test it with your friends

276
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
test it with yourself invite yourself to

277
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,480
a meeting do what you got to do make

278
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,279
sure

279
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,360
that you can be seen and heard and then

280
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
you can see in here as well

281
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,160
um go ahead and put all of your

282
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,040
um if you if you can make sure there'll

283
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
be no outside distractions

284
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,839
um i will be shocked if anybody wants to

285
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,560
know the over

286
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,399
under and put some money on it right now

287
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,279
um my big giant floofer if you've ever

288
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,800
seen any tweet i've ever done every

289
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
other tweet is my dog um

290
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
there's a good chance he'll bark at some

291
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
point today um

292
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
we just moved uh we still for 12 years

293
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,640
to live down the country now we live

294
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,959
in the neighborhood and he's uh very

295
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,320
distracted all the time so he'll

296
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
probably bark for us today

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,079
um that's okay that remember what i said

298
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,440
about watching how

299
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,680
the companies reveal things so if your

300
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,720
kid rolls up

301
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,600
or your dog starts doing something or

302
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
something happens or the tech goes wrong

303
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,399
or something

304
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,120
if the employer reveals themselves to be

305
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
very unflexible about you

306
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,640
just being a normal human dealing with

307
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,760
all the crap we're dealing with right

308
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,720
now then

309
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
they've just revealed something to you

310
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,399
about about them about who they

311
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,279
are um i'll tell you a really quick

312
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,160
story

313
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,680
um when i did the many hats club

314
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,440
isolation con in january or february

315
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
um i was testing out in the green room i

316
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,920
was testing my tech

317
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,519
and uh hope he doesn't mind the shout

318
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,440
out ray redacted

319
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,920
is the person who was helping me and um

320
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,160
when i say close all the things

321
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,279
i'm serious um probably if you're

322
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,240
anything like me

323
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,959
you have many iterations of your

324
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,959
browsers going at all times you know

325
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,000
four or five

326
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,160
at a time and and 20 different tabs on

327
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
each on each browser

328
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,279
and maybe even you have several

329
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,200
documents open

330
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,519
when i shared screens with him to show

331
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
him my slides

332
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
you know what came up on his screen my

333
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
credit report

334
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
my social security number my date of

335
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
birth my credit score

336
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
and he's a hacker so for sure close all

337
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
the things

338
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,519
um and if you know the dual core song

339
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,880
hack all the things

340
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
now i just put that in your head so sing

341
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,079
it to yourself

342
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,720
all the things okay um so detractions

343
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
are everywhere we talked about that

344
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,760
um social media is

345
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,079
more important now than ever and get it

346
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,440
if you don't like it i get it if you

347
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
don't enjoy it

348
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,839
uh there's different um ones that we

349
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,600
like or that we don't like

350
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
uh regardless of what it is that you use

351
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,000
um or don't use

352
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,720
be aware of the digital footprint that

353
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,760
you're putting out there

354
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,720
i'm not saying don't be a human um but

355
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
people are watching you probably more

356
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,279
than ever

357
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,480
you know now this is how we're

358
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,079
connecting this is how we're networking

359
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,959
this is

360
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,920
the only way we're seeing each other is

361
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,639
out there on social media so be aware of

362
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,399
even the things that you see you think

363
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,920
no one else can see

364
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,279
um just imagine that it's it's all being

365
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,399
seen so just

366
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,639
just be cognizant of what your footprint

367
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,920
looks like um

368
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
what you're talking about that can be

369
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,440
very revealing too

370
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,800
um i have seen before you know maybe if

371
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,399
you just have a series of bad days over

372
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,680
and over and over again and maybe it was

373
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
your boss your boss is being a jerk

374
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,079
whatever

375
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,560
if you're putting out way too many

376
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,680
things

377
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,839
consciously or subconsciously either way

378
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,000
the potential employers are looking at

379
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
you too and maybe they're going to think

380
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,079
ah

381
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,079
this person's gonna go down a series of

382
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,320
tweets about me one of these days you

383
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
know something goes wrong so

384
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
i'm not saying don't be human and don't

385
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,760
use your voice and

386
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,519
and all that i'm just saying again to

387
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,720
just kind of be aware of what you're

388
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,279
doing out there

389
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,279
i mean um it it makes sense that if

390
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,560
you've got i mean i got a lot going on

391
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,680
in the background right now i didn't put

392
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,880
up a digital and i didn't cover

393
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,240
everything so there's a lot of you know

394
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
a lot of business stuff going on back

395
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,399
there

396
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,040
uh that could be distracting as well um

397
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,959
kind of i i believe in just being who

398
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,279
you

399
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,839
are um but be reasonable uh if you show

400
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,440
up like a slob if that's the message you

401
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,639
want to put out there

402
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,000
as your first impression um just think

403
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,399
about

404
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,920
you know the impression even though

405
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,440
you're in your house hey listen you guys

406
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
don't know if i have pants on right but

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,279
i do have

408
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,279
this amazing shirt um so

409
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,120
do be um maybe don't show up exactly the

410
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,560
way you would in the office if you were

411
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
gonna wear a suit that's probably not

412
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
necessary but put on a nice shirt

413
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,199
i think um

414
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,240
is made by you um the other person might

415
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,519
have headphones on

416
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,079
who is speaking to you so if you're

417
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
doing

418
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
kind of gross things like sniffling and

419
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
gulping on your drink and

420
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,040
um typing all that sort of thing

421
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,959
um that that can be very distracting as

422
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,560
well if you're

423
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,240
uh using your laptop um

424
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
camera the way that i am right now

425
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,680
because i couldn't find a webcam

426
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,320
anywhere

427
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
um and you slide things around um

428
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,320
on on the desk that can also be very

429
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,680
distracting

430
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,040
um and obviously i don't have a mouse so

431
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,639
i'm not a good example of all the

432
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,480
evidence i'm giving right now

433
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,199
um and again every once in a while make

434
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,079
eye contact

435
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,760
um just so you can kind of connect with

436
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
people i'm obviously looking at my

437
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,399
slides every once in a while i'm looking

438
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,240
out that i try to

439
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,600
make it a point to look down at you as

440
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,760
well okay

441
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
so another survey that i did uh was

442
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
asking people

443
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
um when it comes to searching and

444
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,519
networking and

445
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,440
resume writing which actually got to

446
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,800
tell you i thought that would be the

447
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,440
main thing

448
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,079
uh historically people seem to have

449
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,760
trouble with their resumes

450
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,279
but when i did this survey that wasn't

451
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,959
what people were thinking about or

452
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,720
that's not how they answered

453
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,759
um so i tried to beat this up a little

454
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,800
bit more

455
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,920
on networking for that reason so as far

456
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,720
as job

457
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,880
searching goes everybody knows that we

458
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,839
have job boards

459
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
everybody knows who they all are i

460
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
didn't list them all this is not a

461
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
specific

462
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
um endorsement on my part

463
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,560
i will make no specific endorsements of

464
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,199
tools

465
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,199
or i will not also dox anyone or

466
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,040
anything as a tool

467
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,000
other than to say um and someone did

468
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,519
interrupt me at an in-person

469
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
presentation of this to tell me that i

470
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,079
was wrong

471
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,519
but i personally don't think

472
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,720
you need to pay as a candidate for

473
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,279
anything

474
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
as an employer you do as an employer you

475
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,839
need to pay for all the things

476
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,920
but some of these boards will tell you

477
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,959
that you have to pay

478
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,079
to get this enhanced

479
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,480
um account or profile to be

480
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
better seen or better found um

481
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
i personally i don't agree i don't agree

482
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,120
because i know that i'm

483
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,880
i'm the person paying a lot of money to

484
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,800
find you um

485
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,519
so and so that my my team can find you

486
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,399
um

487
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,839
i don't think you need to spend your

488
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,320
money in that way i also think there's

489
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
way too many volunteers

490
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
my dms are open i'm happy to tell you

491
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,440
who they are

492
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
who will help you with your resume who

493
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,880
will

494
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,000
help you as a candidate um i

495
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,440
don't think you should pay to have

496
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
someone write your resume

497
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,359
i went to i volunteered

498
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,559
for the last several years at a veterans

499
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,280
initiative

500
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,439
something i'm just very passionate about

501
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,880
and uh

502
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
all of them had professional resumes

503
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
resumes were put together for them

504
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,480
and i got their attention when i said

505
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,679
put away your resumes they suck

506

508
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,880

509
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
the professionally written resumes

510
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,240
actually um

511
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
were in a lot of cases doing a

512
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,320
disservice specifically to veterans

513
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,960
um they just weren't translating well to

514
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,520
you know

515
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
how their their mos can speak outside of

516
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,760
the military

517
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,120

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,559
if you are anywhere out there or if you

530
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,679
ever have been even if you're not there

531
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,080
anymore

532
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,440
they're going to find where you used to

533
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
be um they really will

534
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,880
they're going to work on github they're

535
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,919

536
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,039
going to look at your social they're

537
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,240
going to find you

538
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
hopefully um i

539
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
i don't i don't want to i'm not not

540
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
inclusive here

541
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,240
but i i will say that that what i'm

542
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,120
about to say

543
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,400
is statistically often more relevant

544
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,840
to females than males

545
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,480
um for some reason just again

546
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,600
statistically i'm not saying it's

547
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,080
everyone

548
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,880
may not be you uh but they're are less

549
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,760
likely to

550
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,960
apply for a position if they don't feel

551
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,679
like they check

552
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,280
all the boxes in the requirements um

553
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
i am sure that if we were in a room

554
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,640
together

555
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,360
and i asked everyone to please raise

556
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,240
their hand

557
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,640
if the majority of the job descriptions

558
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,400
that you see or on a regular basis you

559
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,840
see lots and lots of really bad job

560
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,240
descriptions i think

561
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,280
most of you would raise your hand um i

562
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,160
get it

563
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,120
i apologize on behalf of hiring

564
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,559
companies everywhere

565
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,000
um it stinks i don't know why it's

566
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,160
happening i don't know why it happens uh

567
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
we could talk about it for days and days

568
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,080
and days

569
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,120
and uh and actually actually do have a

570
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,840
dream

571
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
uh that i could somehow fix it you know

572
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,919
make the companies do a better job

573
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,039
someday all of them um but

574
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,039
don't be afraid to apply for a job that

575
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,360
you don't fit all the qualifications for

576
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,880
because a lot of them are ridiculous and

577
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,799
nobody fits those qualifications

578
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,840
i know so many amazing

579
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,280
brilliant engineers

580
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,960
hackers people who

581
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,159
don't have a degree don't have certs

582
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,200
and some of them have written the

583
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,240
languages

584
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,600
that the job descriptions that are

585
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,720
insane say they want you to understand

586
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,280
right or the tools for that matter um so

587
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,600
i'm not saying that all of the customers

588
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,679
are are going to be flexible but

589
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,799
where there's a will there's a way so

590
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,720
do your research look around i

591
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,679
love twitter i don't have much use for

592
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,039
the rest of it

593
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,480
but some people do right they're out

594
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,120
there so the companies are posting jobs

595
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,159
in all those places uh so so be looking

596
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,039
out there

597
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,559
um do research when you're looking at

598
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,200
companies that you're interested in um

599
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,559
one thing i should say

600
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,039
um is even though everyone knows about

601
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,320
all these

602
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
tools what they don't all realize and

603
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,480
what i didn't realize um

604
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,520
a few years ago is that every state

605
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,000
has its own employment board they have

606
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
to every single one

607
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,039
so think about the state where you

608
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,840
either live or would like to live

609
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,919
and go look at their state employment

610
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,039
board

611
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,360
all the jobs that are posted are there

612
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,400
they're being scraped out of the

613
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
applicant tracking systems even some of

614
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
the ones that haven't been posted yet if

615
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,919
they're in the applicant tracking system

616
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,440
they're being scraped out and they're

617
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
being put on the state employment board

618
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,480
so if you're interested in maryland go

619
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
to maryland's job board

620
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,360
she said in texas go to texas job board

621
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,400
they have one

622
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
am i saying that those job boards are

623
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,360
going to be super easy to use and

624
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,039
intuitive and really

625
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,159
you know they're not going to be great

626
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,919
because they're a local government job

627
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,400
right so

628
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,120
it is what it is but while you're there

629
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
if you find something that you didn't

630
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,440
even realize

631
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,559
i had um i did an experiment at uh

632
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,760
besides tampa

633
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,919
and i said uh let's all whip out our

634
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,880
phones and

635
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520
and look for the state employment job

636
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,720
board um that you're in

637
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,400
or the state that you're interested in

638
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,760
and if you find a job

639
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
um that you didn't even realize you know

640
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,919
the company was in that state or that

641
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,200
they were hiring there

642
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,039
let's talk about it and there was two or

643
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,120
three people who who could do that

644
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,679
so um so take a look there and then when

645
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,840
you find it if you can't navigate around

646
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,679
in on that site very well because the

647
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,679
site like i said probably isn't

648
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,919
awesome uh that's okay too at least now

649
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,200
you know about the job and now you can

650
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,880
start looking for it on these job boards

651
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,600
that are

652
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,280
listed here um especially the free ones

653
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,919
um i know events aren't really happening

654
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,600
right now in person

655
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,320
um you know a lot of companies will do

656
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,799
um

657
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,039
happy hours and hiring events and things

658
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
like that so hopefully we'll get back to

659
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,600
normal soon

660
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
in the meantime um some of the most

661
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,720
innovative companies that are kind of

662
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,440
ahead

663
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
on this or responding very well to it

664
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,799
are still doing a good job in that

665
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,200
regard

666
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,070
with regard to your resume

667
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,000
[Music]

668
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,039
i'm not shocked that people said

669
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
one of the problems that the biggest

670
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
problem was that they just didn't hear a

671
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,799
response i gotta tell you true story i'm

672
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,400
confessing right now

673
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,000
um if i were your your recruiter and

674
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,280
um and i had i don't know i have 20 jobs

675
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,679
open

676
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,440
and you apply to one of my jobs there's

677
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,960
a good chance

678
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,240
depending on the applicant tracking

679
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
system a lot of them are really really

680
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,720
bad

681
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,480
um they're so bad and the um

682
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
there's there's nothing filtering out

683
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,240
the the volume of people applying

684
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,400
it's so time consuming you could end up

685
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,360
spending the

686
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
better part of your day just going

687
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,400
through uh

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
resumes um and and just never getting

689
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,039
around to it right so

690
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,799
um there's got to be a better way and

691
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,559
we'll get to that too so

692
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,559
we'll talk about what do we do about

693
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,400
them not responding

694
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
about the recruiters not responding at

695
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,840
any point

696
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,960
um so please do

697
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,440
an i am and i want to be statement only

698
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
one or two sentences

699
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,159
don't assume that uh the

700
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,919
person reading your resume even

701
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,520
initially depending on the size of the

702
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
company

703
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,320
they may have initial resume screeners

704
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,440
and then the initial

705
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,200
people that take those screening calls

706
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,799
and then they're depending on the size

707
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,240
of the company there could be so many

708
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,600
layers that you have to get through

709
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,120
before you get to somebody

710
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,279
truly qualified to either make a hiring

711
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,840
decision or understand your

712
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,480
qualifications they're given a very

713
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,320
specific set of instructions on what to

714
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,520
be looking for

715
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,600
so do them a favor because they have

716
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,039
fatigue they've looked at a million

717
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,960
resumes today

718
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,880
i really stink at reading resumes don't

719
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,960
tell my boss um

720
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,480
but um so don't do a lot of

721
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,559
dissertations and things like that just

722
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,080
get to the point right at the beginning

723
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,320
and then you're gonna get right into the

724
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,799
the keywords that they're looking for

725
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,159
right you're gonna say i am a systems

726
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,120
engineer

727
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,000
looking to be a solutions architect and

728
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,320
i

729
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,679
love linux and so on and so forth um

730
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,919
then you'll do your chronological and

731
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,840
i'd be happy to send out examples of

732
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,440
resumes to people i think i took that

733
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,960
out of the presentation

734
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,400
um if we were in person i'd give you a

735
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,320
handout um

736
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,080
but if a clearance is required

737
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,640
or uh or the company that does business

738
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,600
with the government

739
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,880
you should take the time to say whether

740
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,360
or not you either have or have had or

741
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,919
are eligible for and willing to get

742
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,840
a clearance that doesn't mean say your

743
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,440
citizenship that's not a thing that they

744
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,799
should ask but just say

745
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,600
eligible for willing to get something to

746
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,400
that effect because that's important um

747
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
it used to be in the olden days that

748
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
pdfs didn't work

749
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,880
the intake mechanisms couldn't read them

750
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,039
and now they can so that's okay

751
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,960
it used to be that people got in their

752
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,240
heads that there had to be a certain

753
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,679
length of a resume

754
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
other than not doing a dissertation and

755
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,520
not making it impossible for me to get

756
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,640
to the point

757
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,799
um don't be afraid to give a lot of

758
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,559
details don't feel like you have to be

759
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,600
on one or two

760
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,679
pages it's okay it's not that big of a

761
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,960
deal

762
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,480
again no one's responding you just

763
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,960
applied so you replied

764
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,520
you applied to my company and you

765
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,960
haven't heard anything back

766
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,880
where you got the initial message but

767
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,039
then you still didn't hear anything back

768
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,200
what are you gonna do about that so

769
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,320
probably

770
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,159
um if you have a linkedin account that's

771
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,400
where i would start and again that's not

772
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
me saying uh anything about linkedin

773
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
other than

774
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,640
most recruiters are there um so you're

775
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,159
going to go there it may or may not be

776
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,600
the recruiter for that position

777
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
and most of them have their direct

778
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,360
messages open

779
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,320
you're going to go in and you're going

780
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
to say hey it's me i applied for this

781
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,400
specific job

782
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,600
and i look forward to hearing back from

783
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,919
you you're going to give them one day

784
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,520
to get back to you that doesn't work

785
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,080
do a little bit of research and look at

786
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,279
who

787
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,080
might be the operational head of the

788
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,760
division where that job is

789
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,720
you're not going to have the full

790
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
breakdown of the org chart but you can

791
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,120
say

792
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,799
hmm vp of such and thus that looks like

793
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,919
where this job would fall probably maybe

794
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,480
ibp of such and thus i applied for

795
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
session that's a job

796
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
and i can't wait to hear back let me

797
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,080
know if you need anything

798
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,039
and then if that doesn't work i want you

799
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,720
to send me a direct message on twitter

800
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
and tell me it didn't work

801
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,120
i'll be shocked i will seriously be

802
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,760
shocked

803
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,120
so do that um and and you're doing that

804
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,080
to remind them

805
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,320
because maybe they forgot or maybe they

806
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,919
lost track or they have

807
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,840
20 other jobs and 50 other candidates

808
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
per job something like that just

809
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,080
do them that polite favor of sending

810
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,520
them a little message

811
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,039
um don't be afraid to and please take a

812
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,679
moment

813
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,720
to when appropriate uh especially as you

814
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,360
go

815
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,559
go further in further in your career

816
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,679
um you are going to have a lot of

817
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,840
different mix of skills

818
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,480
take a moment to go through the job

819
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,679
description

820
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,200
and customize even with just your

821
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,559
opening statement about what you want to

822
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,399
be so they aren't confused about i see

823
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,640
so many things going on in this resume i

824
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,720
i'm not sure what in the world they want

825
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,799
right and also be aware that um

826
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,120
the best recruiters hopefully every

827
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,720
single person that works for me

828
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,120
um but the best recruiters are going to

829
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,919
make the initial conversation with you

830
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,480
about

831
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,240
you not just your match to that specific

832
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,360
position

833
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,559
but what you enjoy doing

834
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,919
what you don't enjoy doing what you want

835
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,120
to do next

836
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,559
because they're going to be aware of

837
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,080
things that aren't even on the job

838
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
boards right so

839
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,159
um make this about about you

840
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
so that's the perfect transition into

841
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,520
the interview stage

842
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,360
you're doing research on the company

843
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,880
you're finding out about the people

844
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,760
in that company you're looking at some

845
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,919
of the key players there

846
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,760
if you do you research on social and you

847
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,440
find out maybe where they're talking

848
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,480
maybe you're gonna run

849
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,159
through the speaker list for san antonio

850
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,840
b-sides today and you're going to notice

851
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
um where people work and if it's a

852
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,840
company that you're interested in

853
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,399
now you have kind of that someone that

854
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,320
you can make a connection to

855
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
either through social or in this case

856
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,679
through this event

857
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,000
that is happening today where this is

858
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
the way that we're networking now since

859
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,880
we can't walk around and talk to each

860
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,159
other in the hallways

861
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,600
and trade badges and stuff um so you're

862
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,799
gonna do the research you're gonna find

863
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,480
out who's speaking there

864
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,440
huh i wonder who they follow on social

865
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,799
and who followed them

866
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,559
what are they talking about are they

867
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,840
talking about anything

868
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,880
that is relevant to me that i can that i

869
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,320
can contribute to and that i can

870
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,520
participate in

871
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
and start having those conversations

872
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
right that's the new way to network

873
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,200
um so you're gonna do that

874
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,279
a little bit of research you know going

875
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,120
into the interview

876
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
if you have the opportunity try to

877
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,080
answer as many questions as you can

878
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,159
in the forum of a story

879
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,919
and then does your resume support these

880
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,520
stories and don't be afraid

881
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,559
to if you if you can talk about

882
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,159
something that you either failed at or

883
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,279
struggled with

884
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,679
and then that's gonna and give you the

885
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,399
opportunity

886
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,159
to show the people that you're talking

887
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,480
to how you solve that problem what you

888
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,919
learn from that problem

889
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,480
and then please this is the best part

890
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,679
and this is the part where hiring

891
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,600
manager should be listening to

892
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,720
um start when they say at the end

893
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,640
that proverbial you have new questions

894
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,559
for me you say

895
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,399
look at them as a person whether it's a

896
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,960
panel or not and give them a chance to

897
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,360
say

898
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,520
how long have you been here um

899
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
what what have you learned lately what's

900
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,440
the top thing you learned this year

901
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,240
that's my favorite question when you

902
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,960
catch

903
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,840
the interviewer off guard with something

904
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,279
like that

905
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,559
um they're going to

906
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,720
become a person and not an interviewer

907
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
and they're going to start telling you

908
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,799
stories this can be very revealing to

909
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,159
you the candidate

910
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
about the company um heck if they

911
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,200
haven't learned anything this year

912
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,360
that's something to think about really

913
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,919
um ask them what challenges they had and

914
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,360
how that turned out

915
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,480
right maybe they'll say well

916
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,679
no now that you mention it

917
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,240
uh or what hesitation did you have

918
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,519
coming into this job

919
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,760
this is you the candidate asking the

920
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
interviewer a question like that

921
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,080
did you have any hesitation did you have

922
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,399
other options why did you choose this

923
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,159
are you glad you chose it you're going

924
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,840
to start interviewing them

925
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,279
and they're going to tell you so much

926
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,200
right it's going to be great for you and

927
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,480
them actually

928
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,200
um this is their chance to tell you you

929
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
know what as a matter of fact

930
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,960
i was really nervous about this job

931
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,480
because

932
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,279
i don't know i i it said you had to if

933
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,559
you had you know metasploit

934
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,679
and i don't know that um

935
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,399
but i was given the opportunity to go to

936
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,120
a workshop

937
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,559
or go to a conference or uh get set up

938
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,760
in a mentoring

939
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
situation with one of my coworkers and

940
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
now i know it now i teach it to people

941
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,480
right so

942
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,880
that's a cool story um it's going to be

943
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,600
good for you

944
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,279
and them um so remember to do that

945
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,960
and then hopefully if you get them

946
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,480
thinking about

947
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,799
what challenges they had what

948
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,320
consultations they had coming into the

949
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,399
position of the company and then they

950
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,159
give you the opportunity or they give

951
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,320
the opportunity to say how it turned out

952
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,399
then you know what to expect in terms of

953
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,399
um how some of your

954
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,000
challenges will be faced there as well

955
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,320
so i really really want you to be

956
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,480
yourself as much as possible

957
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,360
um when i actually when i interviewed

958
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,039
for the job i have now

959
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,559
uh four years ago i had blue hair

960
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,760
and i remember thinking was half blue

961
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,600
and i remember thinking

962
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,360
should i like i'm going to meet all that

963
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,720
i'm going to meet like

964
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,320
yo all the executives should i like

965
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,519
fun or what should i do and i was like

966
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,679
this is me do they like me or do they

967
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,720
not like me

968
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,840
um be honest be exactly who you are

969
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,039
when i say that i liken it to dating i

970
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,919
i actually don't really i don't have any

971
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,679
actual dating experience

972
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,679
um for very very little but

973
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,279
i imagine that if you showed up for a

974
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,720
date

975
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,480
and you sat down and you were like

976
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,559
yes yes i do i love kids i love to

977
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,360
travel

978
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,960
i do go to church i don't contri

979
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,640
if you aren't yourself

980
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,000
in that first date and the relationship

981
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
turns into a relationship i suspect that

982
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,360
um you have you have made it certain

983
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,399
that it's not going to end well right so

984
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,200
don't go to the interview saying i love

985
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,039
solving problems i love working on a

986
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:05,760
team

987
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,359
i love being all by myself

988
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,079
uh don't be afraid to tell exactly what

989
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:12,960
it is because

990
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,679
more than likely there's more than one

991
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,599
opportunity in the company

992
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,918
and while you're selling them exactly

993
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,280
who you are

994
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,320
they're gonna say you know what there's

995
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,879
not an exact match for you with the job

996
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,119
you apply for but

997
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,280
there's this or i expect that soon

998
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,800
there will be this this is how

999
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,560
you can pave the way

1000
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,199
for where you end up to be closer to

1001
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,839
what is

1002
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,320
best and ideal for you

1003
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,000
when i say it's okay to pivot what do i

1004
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,560
mean um

1005
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,079
what i mean is actually in the company

1006
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,560
where i

1007
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,920
am uh one of the vps of one of the cyber

1008
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,040
divisions

1009
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,160
used to work in contracts one of the

1010
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,720
senior help desk technicians used to

1011
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,400
work in hr

1012
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,599
one of my recruiters keeps getting aws

1013
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,920
certs and stuff like that

1014
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,440
one of my recruiters became a scrum

1015
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,960
master

1016
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
uh this is the type of situation where

1017
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
you can look around you and change what

1018
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,560
you're doing

1019
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,280
i mentioned at the beginning that i used

1020
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,160
to

1021
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,960
be a software developer i used to run a

1022
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,079
help desk

1023
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,200
to build help desks and now i run a

1024
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,160
recruiting department

1025
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,880
so that's okay it's okay to pivot as

1026
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,880
many times as you need to

1027
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,760
when you are negotiating please never

1028
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,040
ever

1029
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,599
tell them how much you make if they stay

1030
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,400
on the

1031
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,960
on the application fill in your current

1032
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,760
salary

1033
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
the application probably hasn't been

1034
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,599
updated in the last

1035
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,240
five years it's not okay you do not have

1036
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,119
to put

1037
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,680
it you don't have to tell them your

1038
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,320
salary

1039
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,359
frankly the amount of money money

1040
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,000
that you currently make has literally

1041
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,280
nothing to do

1042
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,880
with the amount of money that you

1043
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,640
should be making based on your

1044
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,320
quantified occupational qualifications

1045
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
and your skills in your education

1046
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,000
and your clearance level and the

1047
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,440
geographical location where you're

1048
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,160
living

1049
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,200
those are the things that should

1050
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,280
determine uh how much money you're

1051
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,200
making so please

1052
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,400
don't tell anybody how much money you're

1053
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,599
making um

1054
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,119
when the recruiter starts and listen uh

1055
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,880
it's going to be at different levels

1056
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
um it may be from the very first phone

1057
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,720
call and i get that it's awkward

1058
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,160
when they say how much money do you want

1059
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
to make

1060
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,640
this is where you can speak in ranges if

1061
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,000
you need to

1062
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,760
and you can say well

1063
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,160
i'm looking at this or i'm seeing offers

1064
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,680
in this area

1065
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,480
or in this range you can speak in ranges

1066
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,040
and then

1067
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,960
think about other things that matter to

1068
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,839
you incentive comp

1069
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,000
plans stock options

1070
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,119
the ability to work remotely

1071
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,320
the ability to go to conferences

1072
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,440
and travel and educational benefits

1073
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,240
401k there's a million things that you

1074
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,440
need to think about

1075
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,480
including as your total comp what

1076
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,880
really super duper matters to you um

1077
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,320
so don't be afraid to say those things

1078
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,000
as well so you know what i

1079
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,400
really am looking for a situation where

1080
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,720
i can take off

1081
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,400
four weeks a year twice a year

1082
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,240
whatever the case may be right so think

1083
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,480
about what is ideal for

1084
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
you and remember i said at the beginning

1085
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,560
that depending on where you are in your

1086
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,320
candidacy you're going to be more or

1087
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,599
less flexible

1088
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,680
uh based on the things that you ask for

1089
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,119
but think about what matters to you the

1090
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,079
most

1091
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,640
whip out a piece of paper draw a line

1092
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,040
down the middle make columns about the

1093
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,320
things that are the most important to

1094
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,800
you

1095
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,040
and try to get those boxes checked uh

1096
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,440
when you are negotiating

1097
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,560
and think about talking to um

1098
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,560
your peers or anyone that you trust in

1099
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,320
either the hiring managers community

1100
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
or recruiting community who can also

1101
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,040
help you and coach you in that area

1102
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,599
and you don't have to give exact answers

1103
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,520
when you get to offer stage

1104
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,440
always think about it always always

1105
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
sleep on it

1106
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,200
and then run it by somebody says you

1107
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,720
know especially if you have someone in

1108
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,320
the recruiting field that you can talk

1109
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,119
to

1110
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,400
you can say hey do you mind if i

1111
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,520
let you know what i was offered and

1112
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,119
and what do you think of this does this

1113
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,880
sound about right is this what i should

1114
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,760
be

1115
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,040
expecting at this point um

1116
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,560
you know i had uh i had a person

1117
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,040
recently fairly recently uh who she just

1118
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,079
graduated from her master's program

1119
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,119
and it took it took two or three

1120
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,160
it took two or three uh go-arounds

1121
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,960
before

1122
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,160
everything matched up but frankly

1123
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,200
um there was not just the professional

1124
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
experience through internships and then

1125
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,720
obviously the education getting the

1126
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,119
masters but there's value

1127
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,960
in and especially in our community i

1128
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,480
would say probably everybody

1129
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,040
um hearing this and everybody visiting

1130
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,160
here

1131
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,000
there's a lot of value in what you do in

1132
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,359
our community

1133
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,280
i could talk for a whole entire day i'm

1134
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
trying to look a clock

1135
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,720
about um are you doing ctfs

1136
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,680
are you speaking at conferences are you

1137
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,880
writing blog posts

1138
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,440
what sort of things are you doing um

1139
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,720
within the community um so when you're

1140
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,000
negotiating think about

1141
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,839
think about those things too right that

1142
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,440
there's value in those things

1143
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,359
that you were a community volunteer or

1144
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,760
that you participated or that you

1145
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,880
um designed and delivered workshops uh

1146
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,079
to teach people

1147
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,520
um that you mentored people in school or

1148
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,040
at work those things are cool don't

1149
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,640
forget to uh to

1150
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,240
to tell those things and to pat yourself

1151
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,359
on the back form because they're

1152
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,400
valuable

1153
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,040
it does not ever hurt to ask um

1154
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,720
think about if it really matters right

1155
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,319
if you're gonna ask for

1156
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,480
eight weeks of vacation i'm gonna wonder

1157
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,839
how often you work

1158
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,040
what the heck you're doing for eight

1159
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,520
weeks personally but if that matters to

1160
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,160
you

1161
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,280
uh there's no there's no harm it is a

1162
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,000
lot

1163
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,280
harder i will say this is

1164
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,720
100 true it's a lot harder

1165
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,359
to jump from where you are in a company

1166
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,240
unfortunately to where you want to be or

1167
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,000
need to be if you didn't negotiate right

1168
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,680
off the bat if you uh

1169
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,839
didn't do well but you love the company

1170
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,680
but you think they're underpaying you

1171
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,960
it's just harder i don't know why

1172
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,400
sometimes you have to leave get more

1173
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,520
money

1174
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,359
um thanks

1175
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,960
i often i personally

1176
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,839
when the current company counter offers

1177
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,240
people

1178
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,800
i often say to myself if i was worth

1179
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,720
that why wasn't i always making it

1180
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,400
right so if i make you an offer

1181
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,839
your company finds out about it and the

1182
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,680
first thing they say is where are you

1183
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,319
going

1184
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,560
and what they offer you and you tell

1185
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,440
them and they're like oh we can match it

1186
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,880
really well you know what i think i

1187
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,359
think

1188
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,480
then you should have already been paying

1189
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,040
me that and

1190
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,400
you're gonna be looking to get rid of me

1191
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,319
next don't want me to leave right now

1192
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,040
because you don't want to have to

1193
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,000
replace me

1194
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,880
but that's just my personal opinion

1195
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,760
about that

1196
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,119
um so think about what the market is

1197
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:57,680
paying

1198
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,920
what clearances are worth what specific

1199
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,839
specific locations are worth based on

1200
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,520
cost of living stuff like that

1201
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,960
and you can do some research on those

1202
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
things as well a lot of

1203
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,079
websites out there for that and we made

1204
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,599
it all the way to questions and answers

1205
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,359
if we have any i can see the red thing

1206
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,440
kirsten we do have a couple of questions

1207
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,240
that are originating from the breakout

1208
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,520
uh um first question can you talk more

1209
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:25,920
about

1210
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,640
internal mobility to starting off in the

1211
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,839
right place

1212
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,440
ask the question again can you talk more

1213
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,400
about the internal mobility to starting

1214
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,520
off in the right place

1215
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,400
i'm not sure i understand the question

1216
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,000
but i i do

1217
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,480
i i if they're saying what i think

1218
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,599
they're saying

1219
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,480
people are always wondering about um

1220
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:52,960
like

1221
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,240
when i said starting off in the right

1222
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,079
place and pivoting around stuff like

1223
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:56,720
that

1224
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,960
if that's what they mean um people are

1225
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,240
always wondering how to break

1226
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,359
in uh see these conversations talk all

1227
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,560
the time about

1228
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,720
how to get into cyber security um

1229
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,040
every company is going to be different i

1230
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,240
think

1231
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,760
um it helps again depending on the size

1232
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,680
of the company it helps to be looking at

1233
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,200
what else is happening there

1234
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,240
look at your own company's job board

1235
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,960
is the company advertising for a

1236
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,359
position that you would like to fill

1237
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,359
you're not 100 sure you're qualified for

1238
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,720
it or you'd like to be qualified for it

1239
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,760
i would challenge you to

1240
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,240
to work through hr or through your

1241
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,079
operations manager really

1242
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,079
they should be able to do this they

1243
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,280
should be able to find a way to make

1244
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,319
this happen

1245
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,240
work through your manager and find out

1246
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,640
how can i fill that position for you or

1247
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,560
how can i get on a track

1248
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,000
or a path to become qualified for that

1249
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,119
position

1250
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,720
i do see kim stevens question i think

1251
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,200
how did how did i get the survey

1252
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,160
information

1253
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,119
all of the surveys that that i put in my

1254
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,760
slides i those are just twitter surveys

1255
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,079
so they're not scientific surveys um i

1256
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,680
didn't grab them off of a website or

1257
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,119
anything crazy like that i just

1258
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,160
i just posted them on twitter and um

1259
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,079
took screen grabs at them that's where

1260
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,280
that came from

1261
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,680
and i have it written down somewhere but

1262
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,640
there was maybe

1263
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,560
i don't know maybe 500 people responded

1264
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,920
not a lot

1265
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
okay we have another question that uh

1266
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,280
stems from the breakout

1267
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,319
um can you provide your thoughts on uh

1268
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,599
the saying that you should never accept

1269
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,240
the uh this individual says i've always

1270
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,480
heard to never accept the counter offer

1271
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,240
once you make known that you're looking

1272
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,560
uh you could be looked at as dead weight

1273
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,640
heard this many times from those who

1274
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,760
accept the counter

1275
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,520
then get the raise and get passed up for

1276
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,440
promotion set to decide etc what are

1277
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,160
your thoughts on that

1278
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
so i don't want the companies that are

1279
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,640
countering people that they truly value

1280
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,280
and that they intend to keep to to be

1281
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,400
upset that i said it

1282
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,560
but um if my advice to people is usually

1283
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,040
not to take it simply because

1284
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,720
i feel like if if you if they wanted to

1285
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,359
give you

1286
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,200
what they're offering to you now you

1287
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,240
never would have been looking and they

1288
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,880
would have already given it to you

1289
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
maybe if you want to give them a little

1290
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,240
slack because you never

1291
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,599
bothered to mention that you were

1292
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,280
unhappy um

1293
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,520
then the conversation can open up it's

1294
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,839
gonna come down to communication frankly

1295
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,640
and if you trust them and you feel

1296
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,280
valued by them

1297
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,800
thank you i thought you i thought the

1298
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,240
question was going to be never accept

1299
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,440
the first offer

1300
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,319
i will tell you i will tell you um if

1301
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,839
you look at my twitter feed today

1302
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,880
uh it was is this uh i was in a

1303
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,079
um like one of those mega threads and i

1304
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,520
said yeah but i don't do it that way

1305
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,400
because i'm weird

1306
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,680
i don't care about your degree or your

1307
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,440
search because i'm weird i also

1308
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,560
never low ball people never have

1309
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,400
and i never will maybe all the hiring

1310
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,920
managers i've ever worked for are like

1311
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,280
really thanks for costing me all that

1312
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,200
money but i just don't see the point

1313
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,040
right if i know what i can do for you

1314
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,440
um i always i'm gonna do the very best

1315
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,440
for you and recruiters should do that

1316
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,880
they should do the very best for you

1317
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,560
does that mean that if they didn't

1318
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,520
they come at you with an offer if i say

1319
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,200
that i'm doing the best i can

1320
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,560
for you than i am does that mean that

1321
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,480
there's no wiggle room

1322
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,560
well maybe there is because i don't i'm

1323
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,119
not the p l holder right so if you said

1324
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,280
person said this was the best she could

1325
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,240
do

1326
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,400
but i need more so i'm not going to talk

1327
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,079
to kirsten anymore

1328
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,880
um i'm still going to fight for you or

1329
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,480
my recruiters are going to fight for you

1330
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,280
um so again it's going to come down to

1331
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,119
them wanting you valuing you and caring

1332
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,839
about you

1333
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,480
you
