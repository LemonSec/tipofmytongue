1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,800
one and in order to do that right like

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,960
from even a defensive or an offensive

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,000
standpoint

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,240
uh you have to know the other side of

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,800
the same coin

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,519
and that's why after my graduation from

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,079
the university of texas at san antonio

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,760
where i was on the collegiate cyber

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,600
defense competition team

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
as the team's token windows guy

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,840
and then thrust into leadership after i

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,680
did all of the blue teaming stuff

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,720
and the defensive stuff in college

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,719
i took a personal interest in the

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,000
offensive

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
side of cyber security and got my

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
sans gayak g pen certification

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,839
for general penetration testing

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
so you're probably here wondering well

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,120
what is this guy going to talk about

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
well that's why i've got a slide for it

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
i'm going to talk about

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,920
what penetration testing is and why we

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,719
need it

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
going to give you a brief overview of

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
some of the tool sets and

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,799
why you would ever choose to use

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,280
microsoft windows as your penetration

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
penetration testing

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,839
platform

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,360
penetration testing pen test

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
red team ethical hacking for the

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
purposes of this talk

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
it's all going to be the same thing to

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,119
talk about

36
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,799
an authorized simulated cyber attack

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,360
on computer systems and networks that

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,560
are designed to

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
assess the security posture of a firm

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,079
or if you're doing it on you know your

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
own personal network yourself

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
you do this in order to understand

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
the weaknesses that exist within your

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,560
network

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,280
how they could be leveraged by a threat

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
actor

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,680
or any other unauthorized party uh the

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,119
sorts of things they would be able to

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,520
see

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
the sorts of things they'd be able to

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,000
take the the ease of difficulty

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
in actually going in and manipulating

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,439
your systems

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
enabling you to do an entire um

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,920
risk assessment to you know

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
is it really worth having a website

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
running on this server

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,319
versus on this one

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,360
very interesting stuff

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
it has become so much more than a

61
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,239
network assessment

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,080
um it encompasses things like

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
social engineering calling up the target

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,200
help desk

65
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,360
impostering yourself as

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
a legitimate user and trying to

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,640
get them to reset credentials

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,040
the biggest thing that i want to say

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
before we get into any of this

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,760
is that any of the tools or techniques

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,879
that i talk about

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,239
in this presentation absolutely

73
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,239
must not be used on a network that you

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:06,720
don't

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,319
already own like it is your network you

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,560
set it up you built it you inherited it

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
it is legally yours or you have express

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,680
written permission to perform these

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,000
sorts of actions on

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
complete with a signed get out of jail

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,760
free card

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,959
and that's because computer crimes are

83
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,080
no joke they can lead to fines or

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
imprisonment and it is

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
frowned upon to use your powers

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,239
for evil you would disappoint clippy

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
and you can see him there in the corner

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,720
sad at the very notion

89
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,360
that you would go about trying to use

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
your newfound powers for evil

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,159
all right let's get back to the fun

92
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,840
stuff now that all the business is out

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
of the way

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,959
penetration testing is great for a firm

95
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
or an individual to understand

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,040
their network and how everything is

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,239
connected

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
as well as how threat actors are able to

99
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,760
manipulate your systems and it allows

100
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,000
you

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,120
to fix issues that you didn't even know

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,279
existed so performing a penetration test

103
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,320
will allow

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,280
vulnerabilities that you didn't know as

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,639
a blue tamer as a defensive operator

106
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
it allows you to see the sorts of

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
vulnerabilities that exist

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,000
and how someone could manipulate them

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,759
to compromise your network

110
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,639
and it's a lot of fun just think of it

111
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,280
as

112
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,520
sort of a puzzle where you're trying to

113
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,720
understand all of the pieces uh with a

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,199
very

115
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,840
vague idea of how everything fits

116
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,240
together

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
i could go on and on about black box pen

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,600
testing

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,080
where the people performing the

120
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
penetration test have no idea what the

121
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
network is like

122
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
versus crystal box penetration testing

123
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,199
where the penetration penetration

124
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,720
testing team

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,240
knows exactly what sorts of hosts exist

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
the vulnerabilities that already exist

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,360
and they don't have to go through all

128
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,400
that scanning

129
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,720
but that's not what this talk is about

130
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,240
we're going to talk about the different

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,680
tool sets that exist

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,800
and how to leverage them if you've spent

133
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
any amount of time in offensive security

134
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,479
you're probably familiar with cali linux

135
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,199
that is the de facto standard

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,320
there's also a black arch which

137
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,600
you know if cali is debian with a gun

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,720
black arch is arch with a gun

139
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
there's you know quite a steep learning

140
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
curve to being able to utilize that

141
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
effectively

142
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,120
there's also parrot os and microsoft

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,840
windows

144
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
which is you know the whole reason that

145
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,720
we're here today

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
so to understand why you would choose

147
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,759
windows first we need to talk about the

148
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
competition right

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,479
so kali linux the industry favorite

150
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,880
be it from a script kitty someone who's

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
just starting out

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
all the way up to advanced persistent

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
threat groups that are nation state

154
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,039
backed and have

155
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,960
funding they're using this debian based

156
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,919
free and open source tool made by

157
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,600
offensive security

158
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,479
to go out and do their day to day

159
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,680
black arch has a whopping 2400 tools

160
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
that you can pick from

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,080
but no desktop experience in which to

162
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
actually run them

163
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,840
unless you know you go about out of your

164
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,000
way to configure it yourself

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
and as a windows guy i earned the the

166
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
moniker bill gates back in college

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,960
because that's

168
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,479
windows is my thing uh

169
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,199
black arch is not for me there's too

170
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,680
much

171
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,479
configuration there using the pacman

172
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,440
package manager to set everything up

173
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,479
i'm not about that life

174
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,039
parrot os is really pretty

175
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,479
so much like a parrot would be

176
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,520
colorful comes with a penetration

177
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,080
testing

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
toolkit as well as digital forensics

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,080
tools

180
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,919
this is also free and open source just

181
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,840
like cali just like black arch

182
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,520
and it's maintained by the parrot

183
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,960
project

184
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,680
we're going to talk about windows which

185
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
if you've ever used a computer

186
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,720
you've probably used microsoft windows

187
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,039
it's been around since

188
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,599
1985 it is closed source

189
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,879
it is not free it is made available for

190
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,440
purchase

191
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,639
by the microsoft corporation

192
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
and it is the de facto standard

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,840
for industry be it for your server

194
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,080
environments

195
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,919
a lot of that is moving more towards

196
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
linux now

197
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
but desktop clients like you know your

198
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,000
go-to

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,759
laptop that you're probably using for

200
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,479
work from home now is likely running

201
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,120
windows uh since we're not doing this

202
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
presentation in person

203
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,160
i can't pull the room uh to see

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,520
how many people are using uh anything

205
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,120
besides windows

206
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
entirely but so i'm just going to

207
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,360
pretend

208
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
that it's not very many of you that have

209
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
been able to completely remove windows

210
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
from your life

211
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,919
and maybe this talk will give you the

212
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,880
opportunity

213
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,839
to reintroduce windows into your

214
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,479
workflows

215
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
you might be asking yourself but why

216
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
with all of these free and open source

217
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,279
tools

218
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,640
why why would i want to run anything

219
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
on microsoft wind blows they're just out

220
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,360
for your money

221
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,560
i can do everything on my own with my

222
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,760
linux anyway that's fine that's totally

223
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,399
fine

224
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,040
i'm not here to like operating system

225
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,519
shame you into using windows

226
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,839
but most of your targets in an

227
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,600
enterprise environment

228
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,240
will be running microsoft windows so

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
having a familiarity

230
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,720
with the the layout definitely helps

231
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,880
windows as a penetration testing

232
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,279
platform will offer you native support

233
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:25,920
for

234
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,959
smb so you can abuse server message

235
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,839
block

236
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
and explore those sorts of

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
shares you can get into your samba

238
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
shares fairly easily

239
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
comes equipped with powershell which

240
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
controversial opinion

241
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
i think is better than bash there are

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,720
remote server administration tools that

243
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,800
are bundled by microsoft they make it

244
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,600
easy

245
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
you land on a box you get your

246
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,120
credentials you're able to just add them

247
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,080
into your rsap you have access to the

248
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,160
entire sysinternal suite

249
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,279
so you can see exactly what sorts of

250
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
things it is that you're manipulating on

251
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
a box

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,560
and how the incident response team will

253
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,279
be able to

254
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
respond to that incident

255
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,360
there's also some windows-based command

256
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,240
and control

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,959
systems that i think are really cool

258
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,160
such as covenant which is built on.net

259
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,199
and posh c2 which is built on powershell

260
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
that's not enough to make me switch

261
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,079
that's totally fine

262
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,120
you don't have to and with

263
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,480
the innovation of the

264
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,480
windows subsystem for linux or wsl

265
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,160
you don't have to whenever i go

266
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,200
on engagements uh i'm running

267
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,240
usually a windows box with cali

268
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
installed as a subsystem so you don't

269
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
need a virtual machine everything is

270
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,120
just

271
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
right there you also have docker freely

272
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,880
available

273
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,519
for those tools that you absolutely need

274
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,920
docker for

275
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,480
and sometimes you won't have a choice

276
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
there are

277
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
engagements that you'll have to go on

278
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,760
where it's a strictly windows only

279
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
environment

280
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,680
and there are limitations on the sorts

281
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
of operating systems that you're able to

282
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,040
bring in

283
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,199
and you have to use windows

284
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,880
another drawback you know besides

285
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,560
forcing your arm

286
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
i'm sorry another positive point instead

287
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,839
of forcing your arm

288
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,440
is native support for microsoft azure

289
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,160
and active directory with a lot of

290
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,880
systems

291
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,680
moving towards cloud-based security

292
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,519
being able to interface

293
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,800
with azure right on your penetration

294
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,639
testing platform

295
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,000
is a godsend

296
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
so we're going to talk about um this

297
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,000
really

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,200
cool tool that i

299
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,399
found it is commando vm

300
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,880
it is made by mandiant a division of

301
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,320
fireeye

302
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
it's free to do all the setup scripts

303
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:12,800
but you still got to pay for your

304
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
windows license

305
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
i do want to let you know um this is in

306
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
no way a sponsored talk

307
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,079
i just really like the tool set

308
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,839
and yeah

309
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,040
so it comes with a bunch of tools

310
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,959
straight out the box

311
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,279
for your information gathering phase of

312
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,560
a penetration test

313
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,760
penetration testing test you have

314
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,519
tools like bloodhound and nmap

315
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
there are your networking tools like

316
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,560
wireshark

317
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,600
and an implementation of tcp dump to

318
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
dump your network traffic

319
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
written specifically for windows

320
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
for the exploitation phase you've got

321
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
like proof exchange and

322
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,040
metasploit everybody loves metasploit

323
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,519
uh for your password cracking utilities

324
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,560
you have things like

325
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
kane and john you also have

326
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
hashcat mimikats for your web apps

327
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
you've got things like

328
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,600
owasp zap all of these

329
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
built for windows

330
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
and for your vulnerability analysis you

331
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,000
can go even as in depth

332
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,959
as reversing the binaries using tools

333
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,760
like ida

334
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,959
or binary ninja

335
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
so why exactly do you want me to use

336
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
windows

337
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,720
the tool sets are compatible comparable

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
you have the linux tools

339
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
also with windows versions and if it's

340
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,079
not native you can just run it

341
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,800
in wsl this allows you to save space

342
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,320
so you don't have to switch between your

343
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
linux environment and your windows

344
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,839
environment

345
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,079
while performing penetration tests you

346
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,440
can do everything

347
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,680
straight from one box

348
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,160
and as i had mentioned before you'll

349
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,880
have

350
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
at times restrictions on

351
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,120
the ability to pick and choose what

352
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
tools

353
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
you bring into the engagement

354
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
there are reasons why you should not

355
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
use microsoft windows and that has to do

356
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,519
with the licensing cost

357
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
you still need to pay for the os license

358
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,760
windows does have some overhead you're

359
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
going to need more ram

360
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
in order to actually use microsoft

361
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
windows

362
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,959
and your fellow cyber professionals will

363
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,600
at least

364
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,320
laugh at you or give you strange looks

365
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,560
i've had to deal with that

366
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,360
quite a little bit but i like making it

367
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,320
a challenge

368
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
to you know use the

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
unpopular impossible tool suite to still

370
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
get the job done

371
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,959
the biggest thing to know is that

372
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,000
having access to a ton of tools isn't

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,880
going to make you a good hacker

374
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,000
what is is knowing the tool set that

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,920
you've been given

376
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
your personal limitations not being

377
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,040
afraid

378
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,360
to you know ask for help and

379
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,639
continuously learning

380
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
and iterating so that you get better and

381
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,519
you know you're not just

382
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,079
a script kitty you're going through

383
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,519
learning the tools of the trade

384
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,759
learning what works for you what works

385
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,079
for each any given situation

386
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,199
and knowing that um

387
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,240
attitude how you approach the problem is

388
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
more important than

389
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,880
the tool sets that you use

390
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
so that's the end of my slides i can

391
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,320
give you

392
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
a quick little tour of the

393
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
commando vm if you give me just a minute

394
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,199
here

395
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,120
to switch windows

396
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
um am i able to see any questions in the

397
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,079
chat is that a thing

398
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
i'm used to having an audience um

399
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,399
actually the there's no

400
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,519
questions in the q a right now um the

401
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:15,920
talk

402
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
on discord uh there's a pretty robust

403
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
conversation going on be the track one

404
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,240
breakout room

405
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,320
okay that's where everybody's gonna hang

406
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
out and then want to chat with you later

407
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
i will definitely check that out thank

408
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
you so much

409
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,040
let's see i want to share

410
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,120
all right you should be able to see my

411
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,560
uh commando vm

412
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,560
yes sir all right so

413
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,959
one thing that's really cool is by

414
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,880
default powershell doesn't

415
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,120
log the things that you type

416
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,959
one of the nifty things that mandiant

417
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,320
has done is actually

418
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,839
allow you to log all of that

419
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,240
to text files that it automatically

420
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,559
organizes for you which

421
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
after undergoing a penetration test is

422
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,319
definitely

423
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,280
super useful whenever you're in the

424
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,160
thick of the moment

425
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,039
and you know you're not taking notes on

426
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,559
what you're doing

427
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,919
uh as i've been guilty of you're able to

428
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,959
go back and actually look at

429
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
the commands that you've run and

430
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,160
how they've affected the system so let's

431
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,880
get out of

432
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,919
the transcripts let's look at some of

433
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,320
the

434
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
nifty tools they've got things like

435
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,799
active directory tools you can go in

436
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,679
there

437
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
and look at all of the administration

438
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
tools

439
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,400
you can mess with dns whenever you

440
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,520
connect it to

441
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,480
a target server so you don't even need

442
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,280
to be

443
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
like you don't need an interactive shell

444
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,799
or rdp

445
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,919
into the box that you're targeting you

446
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,400
just need to have the appropriate

447
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,919
credentials to do everything remotely

448
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,039
you've got python 2 and python 3 you've

449
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,080
got go

450
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,360
you've got get support

451
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
the win pcap driver stuff

452
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
let's go back a folder say go back a

453
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,919
folder

454
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,640
thank you uh your command and control

455
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
sets

456
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,640
uh all of the stuff for your.net

457
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
your networking tools

458
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,559
your password attack stuff hashcat

459
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
lovehashcat

460
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,160
super helpful note if you are on windows

461
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
is that you are able to more easily

462
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,559
access the the drivers for your onboard

463
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,160
video card

464
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,120
so if you have a gaming laptop and you

465
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,080
want to take it on a penetration test

466
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,280
use hash cat use your your gaming

467
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,799
graphics card and

468
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,520
you are good to go straight out of the

469
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,080
box

470
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,880
there are some other utilities uh like

471
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,039
process hacker that's part of the

472
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,240
system internal stuff uh your

473
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
vulnerability analysis

474
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,960
uh you can install things like nessus on

475
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
top of this so

476
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,400
you're able to have a better

477
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
understanding of the entire network's

478
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,120
security posture

479
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,480
they've changed the the right-click menu

480
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,960
so you're able to just open up command

481
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,000
prompt or powershell

482
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,919
as admin so if we go ahead and open up

483
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,440
where's my command prompt there we go

484
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,400
who am i you're the commando user

485
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
they've also added timestamps

486
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,840
up here to the top baked into your

487
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,799
command prompt

488
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,720
which is something that's not native to

489
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,200
windows but definitely

490
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,720
something that i find useful

491
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,440
you've got the entire kali linux suite

492
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,000
right here

493
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
oops

494
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,640
all right i clearly don't remember my

495
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
password

496
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,840
that happens

497
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,720
but everything that you would use on

498
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,480
cali is available not only within cali

499
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,840
but within commando as well

500
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,760
you
