when you weren't

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,160

in-person con and then transitioning uh

11

to virtual only con but

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
obviously it's for the better of the

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
community so it's something that had to

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,240
happen

be in the breakout room

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,000
after the talk so some of my hobbies

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,520
include spending time with my family and

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,360
my two kids

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
they're told not to come in here but who

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
knows we might have

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,880
a visitor or two as it is with virtual

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,360
conferences i enjoy home lab home

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,560
automation

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
i'm a colonel con board member which is

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,680
a conference

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
in omaha nebraska we also had to go

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
completely virtual this year so like i

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,280
said i feel the pain of the organizers

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,479
um and i enjoyed participating in ctf

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,200
competitions

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,240
uh a quick little inspiration about this

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,960
talk

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
um uh in the past i've worked for some

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,880
huge companies big berkshire halfway

52
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,240
conglomerate

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
worldwide data provider cable services

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,759
conglomerate

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,799
all of these companies had um

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
a huge staff spread of crap spread

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,960
across

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
uh spread across the nation and

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
sometimes the world

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,160
and um i worked at these places and i

61
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
just got a feel for that large corporate

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
lifestyle and

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,920
did some application security i worked

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,599
on some internal application security

65
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,400
teams

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,760
some internal software teams uh but now

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,120
i work for um in a startup essentially

68
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
there was about 150 employees when i

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
started we have about

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,080
300 employees right now but um

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
it's just a world of difference and so

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,519
it's

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
really i was able to reflect back on my

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,280
time at a big

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
company and i was able to kind of

76
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
uh come up with some some

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,239
resources and some tips and tricks

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,920
when you work at a big company like that

79
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,599
and uh and develop

80
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,800
this uh develop just talk so

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,920
uh now you might be wondering why

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,879
a kid from nebraska is gonna talk to you

83
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,080
about

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
climbing mountains but just wait it's

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
going to make sense

86
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,720
so uh first i'd like to introduce you to

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,040
apsec ned um absec ned is just a he's a

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,640
application engineer he's a

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,319
representative of many internal

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,599
application

91
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,720
uh security engineers into one easy to

92
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
draw

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
person he works for a large enterprise

94
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
and he's starting an internal

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,519
application security team

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,720
at this large enterprise and he's happy

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
that his company is prioritizing

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
application security

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,599
and like all good security personnel

100
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
abseconned is on twitter so if you're

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,080
interested in following along

102
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,799
with his journey he he likes to make his

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,000
way around the nation

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,640
talking about the perils of creating

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,239
mountains for your internal application

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,519
security teams

107
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
so uh but he had

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
so when he joined the team he was given

109
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,799
some directives

110
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,879
uh and this is kind of generic

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
directives given to all internal

112
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
application security teams

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
uh first he had to ensure that all code

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
bases are secure

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
including all open source software

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,519
utilized

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,279
um he had to ensure all future

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,880
development is secure

119
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,680
uh and his board heard the term shift

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,320
left

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
with future development so they they

122
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
made that a priority

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,759
which is also a kind of a buzzword we'll

124
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
we'll talk more about that later

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,919
if you haven't heard of it but uh if

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,759
you're in application security i'm sure

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,199
you have

128
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,840
uh he has to train software developers

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,600
in secure coding practices

130
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,919
and minimize attack vectors in external

131
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,160
facing applications

132
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,759
so ned has these directives given to him

133
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,199
and but ned has some

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,000
industry challenges right two out of

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,479
every

136
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,520
three applications fail to pass initial

137
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,160
tests

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
on the os top 10 and the sams 25

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
standards that's incredible

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,160
but 67 or more applications will

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
fail on the initial test um the average

142
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,039
time to remediate an application

143
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,000
vulnerability

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
is 171 days now

145
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
that's the average there's of course

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,639
outliers but

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,400
that seems like a really long time

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,919
that's over five months and uh

149
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,479
one software security specialist to

150
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,280
every 73 software engineers and

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
developers

152
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,440
so this is a number pulled from the bsim

153
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
if you set behind one maybe even two

154
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,560
developers

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,520
and you watch them code all day to

156
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,039
determine whether or not they're coding

157
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,240
securely

158
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
you could do that technically but can

159
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,639
you imagine trying to sit behind

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
73 developers to watch them code

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
i mean that's impossible not to mention

162
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,199
ned's team also has to review

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
new library vulnerabilities and open

164
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
source software vulnerabilities that

165
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,520
are released every day these are some

166
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
serious challenges

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,479
also um all of the most common

168
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,319
vulnerabilities over the last five years

169
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,520
are still just as prevalent today uh

170
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,319
these five vulnerabilities were the most

171
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:22,960
common

172
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,840
vulnerabilities in 2015 and they're the

173
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
most common vulnerabilities in 2020.

174
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,319
what does that mean well that means that

175
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,759
our software teams

176
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,080
aren't necessarily learning right these

177
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
are typical mistakes that are still made

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,039
today

179
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,400
and if you have people who aren't

180
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
learning or gleaning information from

181
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,720
training that's a problem right

182
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
we would expect that these would fade

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
away in and

184
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,720
there'd be a new set of the next five

185
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,160
top vulnerabilities

186
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,919
that hasn't happened in addition to

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
these type of challenges um also the

188
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,639
typical application

189
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,759
uh has a ton of challenges

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,840
so in a typical application this is a

191
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,919
this is maybe a little convoluted slide

192
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,080
let me uh let me describe it here

193
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,759
in a typical application uh 21

194
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,840
is custom code and about 70

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,440
70 is like is unused library code

196
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,240
across 30 or more libraries that's the

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
kind of code that

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,639
um gets pulled in with a library and

199
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,199
really just

200
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,479
isn't utilized um so there's a big

201
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,919
discrepancy

202
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,240
between the custom code and the library

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,960
code

204
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,520
just in sheer volume and like you can

205
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,199
see from the slide deck

206
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
uh the majority of the code is in the

207
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,759
unused library code

208
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,960
well also um

209
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,919
over 70 percent of the code you ship is

210
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,960
unused

211
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
and only two vulnerabilities occur in

212
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
there on average

213
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,080
meanwhile 26 vulnerabilities

214
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,280
um on average occur in the custom code

215
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,240
so that is just adding more numbers to

216
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
the mix here but

217
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
that's 93 of all vulnerabilities that

218
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
are found occur within the custom code

219
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
so this custom code right here this top

220
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,599
of the iceberg

221
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,960
that's where you're going to get 93

222
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,800
of your vulnerabilities so this is

223
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,319
another problem that ned's facing

224
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,120
but ned really he knew about all those

225
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,080
challenges

226
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,120
when he took the job um

227
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
he had some climbing gear so ned had

228
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
uh ned had some climbing gear that he

229
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,719
knew about

230
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,760
going into this job uh the workplace

231
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,120
already had static

232
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
application security testing or sas as

233
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,959
it's known

234
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,040
they had a dynamic application security

235
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
testing or das

236
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,760
they also had a web application firewall

237
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:09,839
and they had a compliance team

238
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
into your network then there's a

239
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,399
compliance team for auditing and

240
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,480
penetration remediation etc so ned

241
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
he felt prepared for anything you know i

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,839
i prepared this slide before kovid but

243
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,080
then uh

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
during the toilet paper shortage of 2020

245
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
that we'll tell our grandkids about

246
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,199
i thought this was a perfect slide

247
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
i'm being told that there's an audio

248
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,800
glitch

249
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,920
can people still hear me

250
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,440
okay okay well uh

251
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
just to sum up again ned had some

252
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
uh hand-me-down climbing gear that the

253
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
uh

254
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
that the um company he's working for

255
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,720
already had

256
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,839
uh sast and das tools web application

257
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,560
firewall

258
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
and a compliance team for auditing

259
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,079
penetration remediation etc so

260
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,680
ned felt like he was prepared for

261
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
anything um

262
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,000
and so he felt good but

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
you know let's talk a little bit about

264
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
the state of application security

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,040
especially at a large corporation

266
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,560
uh there's a lot of hidden challenges

267
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,760
i'm going to go back to

268
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
the iceberg type slide here

269
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,079
where ned is aware of the top of this

270
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,360
iceberg basically

271
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,600
he's aware of some of the challenges but

272
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,279
there's a lot of hidden challenges

273
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,519
associated with working at a big

274
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
company um including old tooling

275
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
mergers and acquisitions new products

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,440
and new technologies

277
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
workplace shifts and inflexible

278
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,040
developers

279
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,399
so these kind of challenges exist um

280
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
they're much more prevalent when you're

281
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
working at a bigger company

282
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
and i'm going to discuss each of these

283
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,839
and how

284
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,959
absec ned can overcome

285
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,920
challenges like this so let's talk a

286
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,279
little bit about old

287
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,800
tools this is uh

288
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,320
trigger warning for some people but um

289
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,360
here's here's some here's a uh

290
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
application security timeline and

291
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,040
there's uh there's more

292
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,959
uh to the right here and there's even

293
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,320
more to the left

294
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,800
but i want to focus on this time period

295
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,920
real quick

296
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,160
um basically uh penetration testing

297
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,279
uh became popularized in 1999

298
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,360
the owasp o wasp top 10 was formalized

299
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,800
and introduced in 2001

300
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,639
but what else did we notice here um the

301
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
four the four uh

302
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
things that we just talked about as um

303
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
as his climbing gear

304
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
they're uh they're old they're more than

305
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
17 years old this is when they were

306
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,839
introduced that's not to say that

307
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,639
uh ned's team is using a static analysis

308
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,639
tool from 2002

309
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,680
but technology uh hasn't

310
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,079
hasn't been introduced from hasn't

311
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,920
changed really since then

312
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,639
there's there's been new stuff but ned's

313
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,040
team

314
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,160
is still using these kind of tools and

315
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,720
uh

316
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
this is 2002 to 2003 time frame

317
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,839
and you know we're in 2020 so that's

318
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,839
these are old tools that he's using and

319
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
what's what's wrong with old security

320
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
tools as long as they're getting updates

321
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,079
right

322
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,959
well they can be slower they can be

323
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,320
slower both with

324
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,519
scanning and remediation i know for a

325
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,639
fact that

326
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,560
one of the sas tools i used at um

327
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,839
i used at a previous employer uh

328
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
when we needed to update the tool

329
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,800
we had to contact our it because

330
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,519
they owned the server uh and we didn't

331
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,000
have permissions to get the machine key

332
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,040
so they'd go and get a machine key for

333
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
the server that it was running on

334
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,600
then they would provide us the machine

335
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,079
key

336
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,079
we'd open a ticket with the sas provider

337
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,279
they'd create the new sas tool uh keyed

338
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,639
with our machine key

339
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,040
so that we can utilize it they'd give it

340
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,079
back to us

341
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,680
then we'd have to open a ticket with our

342
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
ite support

343
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
to install the new upgrade that takes

344
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,279
forever

345
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,320
and people were hesitant to

346
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
jump on to upgrade these tools

347
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,639
can you imagine how many vulnerabilities

348
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,639
you might miss during that process

349
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,320
you're waiting on people you're having

350
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,160
to open tickets um

351
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
by the time this all happened sometimes

352
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,560
it took three weeks

353
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
an update would come out and we would be

354
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,959
updated three to four weeks later

355
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,720
and during that time frame you can miss

356
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
new vulnerabilities

357
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
i mean just think about the last week uh

358
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,199
anybody see the um show of uh emojis

359
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,399
on uh on discord but anybody see the

360
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,040
most recent like um rces there was a f5

361
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,079
one a big ip one uh there was several

362
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,600
within the last week

363
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,959
in some big corporate type tools and if

364
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,440
you're

365
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,839
taking four weeks to upgrade your tools

366
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,160
you're going to miss stuff like that

367
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,240
and you're going to miss vulnerabilities

368
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,600
another problem with old

369
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,199
old tooling is alert fatigue uh

370
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,920
tools were got really good at telling

371
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,240
you

372
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
when something could be wrong uh they

373
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,839
got they never they never really learned

374
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,519
um basically how to tailor those alerts

375
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,040
so uh oftentimes with sas you you end up

376
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,320
getting overwhelmed with alerts

377
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
not to mention web application firewalls

378
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
um web application firewalls

379
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,639
uh that's mostly just a regex search

380
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,079
uh against the inputs and we're going to

381
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,800
uh um we're gonna talk more about that

382
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,519
but

383
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,320
that really causes alert fatigue as well

384
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,959
and

385
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,480
they don't offer the best protection

386
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,959
against attacks um

387
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,440
this is uh like static code is

388
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,480
essentially uh

389
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
attempting to read your code and

390
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,720
determine if there's a vulnerability

391
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,440
um more on that later we're gonna

392
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,160
there's a little foreshadowing so

393
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,920
let's talk a little bit about mergers

394
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,519
and acquisitions uh

395
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,160
again i created these slides pre-covered

396
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
this is an outdated practice now

397
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,800
but um m a is a is a big part of

398
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
big business if you work for a big

399
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
company you can expect

400
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
that there's going to be a merger or

401
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,480
acquisition while you're there

402
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
it's a it's natural especially if your

403
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
company is publicly traded

404
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,519
um you know there's the famous quote by

405
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,880
the microsoft ceo

406
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,720
every business will be a software

407
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
business and

408
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,959
you've heard probably mark andreessen

409
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,759
say

410
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,800
uh software's eating the world right

411
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,880
um every company is having

412
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,639
have some they they all have some sort

413
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,519
of software component to them now

414
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,480
and when you're acquiring another

415
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,440
company

416
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,320
you don't know what you're inheriting uh

417
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,839
it could be terrible software

418
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,720
could be garbage servers etc and that's

419
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
a major problem for internal application

420
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,079
security teams

421
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,959
i worked at a company that did mna and

422
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,880
didn't involve the application security

423
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,279
team

424
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,480
at all and again that was the big

425
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
problem because

426
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,759
what we ended up what ended up happening

427
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,639
was

428
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,720
we would inherit something and we'd have

429
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
to spend

430
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
you know a full-time employee

431
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,559
essentially fixing their code

432
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,880
uh because we just inherited somebody

433
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,599
with

434
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,640
uh you know 40 uh

435
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,760
critical vulnerabilities including the

436
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,119
most basic

437
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,160
uh uh one or

438
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,079
one sql injection like we inherited a

439
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,160
company with a problem like that

440
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,039
and so there was there was a lot of um

441
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,679
heartache

442
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,039
a lot of grief uh and this is

443
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,200
this is a major problem industry-wide

444
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
and when you think about application

445
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,640
spread

446
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,520
um large organizations they already have

447
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
more applications than the industry

448
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,600
and now they're doing m a to just add

449
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,320
to ned's pile of ever-growing work

450
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,799
here's

451
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,360
let me just uh let me just bring that in

452
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,160
real quick here

453
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,320
here's here's the differences right

454
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,360
industry-wide

455
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
so that means um organizations

456
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,480
with a single owner to organizations

457
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,760
with

458
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,559
um thousands of employees five thousand

459
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,919
plus employees

460
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,559
look at the difference here uh the the

461
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,440
numbers

462
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,840
down here uh next to the color those are

463
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,480
the number of

464
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,679
applications that your company has

465
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,720
industry-wide across the whole industry

466
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,919
more than half of companies have

467
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,880
less than 200 applications but when you

468
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
are looking at a large organization with

469
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,080
5 000 plus employees

470
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,360
the majority of those 36 have

471
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,799
over a thousand applications i mean

472
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
you're talking about time tracking

473
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
software internal applications

474
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,960
you're talking about external facing

475
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,080
websites external facing software every

476
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,000
one of these applications

477
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,440
is included in this and that's a huge

478
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,799
discrepancy right

479
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,400
uh when you're looking solely at a large

480
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,520
organization

481
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
and the majority of those have over a

482
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,000
thousand applications

483
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,880
that's a huge difference and now they're

484
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,679
adding more

485
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,440
right through mergers and actually

486
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,039
mergers and acquisitions

487
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,640
they're adding more company more

488
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,120
software more applications

489
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,640
and uh any when you're acquiring

490
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,679
another company you're not adding just

491
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,960
one or two

492
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,559
applications you're adding their entire

493
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,160
software stack

494
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,960
now you know you're exposed in the

495
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
entire way that they're exposed

496
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,559
you know if they have a bad

497
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,960
infrastructure you're you know

498
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,559
that you're inheriting that we had um

499
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,360
in my experience we had a spot where we

500
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
were acquiring another company it was a

501
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,679
smaller

502
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,039
organization and they were able to pass

503
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,720
pci compliance through a self check

504
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,320
because they were small enough when

505
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,480
you're small enough you

506
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
can basically fill out a worksheet and

507
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,280
they'll say that you're pci compliant

508
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,480
and we went and looked and uh they would

509
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,600
have failed

510
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,159
our they would have made us fail or our

511
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,840
pci compliance

512
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,600
so we couldn't acquire them until after

513
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,760
we went through our pci um compliance

514
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,600
audit because we would have failed

515
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,240
so we had to finish our audit before we

516
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,600
acquired this company

517
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
because just by acquiring them we were

518
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,280
going to fail our

519
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,919
entire audit and then we had to go and

520
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,400
fix

521
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
all of their stuff over the course of

522
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
the next year

523
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
and that's a challenge and that's a

524
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,640
challenge for absec ned

525
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
uh let's talk let's talk about new

526
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,440
products and new technologies this is

527
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,760
this is a popular topic because there's

528
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,679
always something bigger and better and

529
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,200
better and best

530
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
out there um

531
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
i mean let's face it software change is

532
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,679
constant and

533
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
i don't uh i don't mind that

534
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,559
i mean that's that's a good thing we

535
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,559
want software change to happen i mean

536
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,960
it's usually for the better right just

537
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,320
here i show like

538
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,679
you've your agile um you've got your

539
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,240
devops

540
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,120
you have your microservices uh you've

541
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,559
got your cloud providers

542
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,159
uh azure gcp and aws you've got your uh

543
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,400
continuous integration platforms

544
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,840
like freaking jenkins uh git lab and

545
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,559
github

546
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,600
actions um you have your containers

547
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,640
kubernetes docker i mean these are these

548
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,159
are all happening

549
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,919
you know and things are just continually

550
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,320
add to the software stack

551
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,159
it's not necessarily a bad thing like i

552
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,360
said these are great

553
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,200
i love docker containers i love the

554
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,440
ability to create my own app

555
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,559
that just spins up in its own container

556
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
and i can just kill it um whenever i

557
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,679
need to

558
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,559
i like continuous integration platforms

559
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,120
these are

560
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,919
these are good things but let's talk

561
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,799
about the problem with that right

562
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,400
so as ned is noticing here his mountain

563
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
is starting to get a little

564
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,400
bigger you know it started with the old

565
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
tooling the mergers and acquisitions

566
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,840
and now new technologies um

567
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,640
new products and new products and new

568
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,360
technologies

569
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,120
i mean what's the new hotness right

570
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,240
um here's an example rust

571
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,600
go kotlin

572
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,679
right the funny thing about this rust

573
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,799
logo is uh

574
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,880
i don't play video games and for the

575
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,280
longest time in the slide deck i had uh

576
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,240
i had the rust video game logo until

577
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,039
somebody

578
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,679
somebody told me last week i thought

579
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,440
that was pretty funny

580
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,640
but um these are all these are all new

581
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,520
hot

582
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,440
languages right i don't want to

583
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,200
discourage innovation but

584
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,799
encourage consideration right um

585
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,200
when you have these new technologies

586
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,000
chances are

587
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
ned's existing tools don't cover it yet

588
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,799
right in 2008 i think is when go came

589
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,600
out

590
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,440
and go is just starting to get

591
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,760
wide acceptance into tools nowadays

592
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,280
and it's been it was invented in 2007.

593
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
okay here's a note i have it was

594
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
invented in 2007

595
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,200
and it launched in 2009 as open source

596
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
so it's been around for 11 years

597
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,080
and tools are starting to just like have

598
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,159
a wide acceptance of go

599
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,320
for example so when a new language comes

600
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,159
out like rust or kotlin i mean those two

601
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,200
aren't very old

602
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,799
uh you know how long will it be before

603
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,400
we have tools that support that

604
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,919
it could be a while right so again

605
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,679
we're not discouraging innovation here

606
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,760
just encourage consideration

607
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,159
so we'll talk more about how we can

608
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,279
handle that but

609
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,720
this is just adding to ned's challenges

610
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
and these mountains are getting bigger

611
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,360
and bigger

612
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,960
and um ned was aware of some of the

613
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,679
industry-wide challenges but these

614
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,080
challenges at these big companies

615
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,400
where it's the wild wild west and

616
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
developers have the

617
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,279
uh latitude and to just do what they

618
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,320
want

619
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,520
right um is just adding to

620
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,559
is just adding to his um his stack

621
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,240
let's talk a little bit about workplace

622
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
shifts workplace shifts happen

623
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,039
especially with time it's hard to ignore

624
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,320
the facts but

625
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,159
there are several kinds of workplace

626
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,559
shifts or relocations

627
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,679
um you know older developers retire or

628
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,360
move into new roles

629
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,159
layoffs i mean layoffs are a big thing

630
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,200
nowadays too

631
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
there's a when i'm on twitter there's a

632
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,440
lot of people who are looking for work

633
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
um and that's that's tough

634
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,000
right uh sometimes layoffs are even

635
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,279
accompanied by overseas hiring

636
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,200
so that that's why i didn't call this

637
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,039
just uh just um

638
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,360
workplace loss but i called it workplace

639
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,559
shift because

640
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,200
uh sometimes you have people going out

641
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
uh sometimes you have people being

642
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,679
replaced

643
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,760
and and that kind of thing happens it's

644
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,720
it's natural

645
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,000
um you know it's a it's a crappy thing

646
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,039
to talk about but um it's it's

647
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,520
it's natural and it's even more natural

648
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,440
at large corporations

649
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,960
this is this is to be expected and

650
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,039
um you know ned has

651
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,200
ned has a problem with workplace shift

652
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,080
right uh nan has to train new employees

653
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,120
uh sometimes in remote locations uh

654
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
whether it be a time zone difference or

655
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,440
a language barrier

656
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
it's tough to work with new employees

657
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,440
directly

658
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
and how do they retain the knowledge of

659
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,039
the departing staff

660
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,799
how do we continue to meet application

661
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,080
security standards

662
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,840
when we have turnover in our own staff

663
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,240
these are challenges that ned faces with

664
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
workplace shifts

665
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,440
what about application security secrets

666
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,840
you know when you have uh when you have

667
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,879
people getting laid off

668
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,159
how does ned um ned has to concern

669
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,039
himself with

670
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,600
application security secrets um you know

671
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
if we lay somebody off

672
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,440
ned also has to worry about you know a

673
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,200
disgruntled employee

674
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
so these are these are things that you

675
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,720
know ned has

676
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,120
uh to keep in the back of his head and

677
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,720
and those mountains are looking big and

678
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,600
he's

679
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,799
looking nervous now

680
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,679
lastly uh this is a topic everyone loves

681
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,720
to hate

682
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,080
but in flexible developers um i was a

683
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,679
developer i was a developer for almost

684
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,279
nine years so i have a lot of experience

685
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,880
with development teams

686
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,159
um and application security teams

687
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,559
so what is an inflexible developer well

688
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,600
um here's an example

689
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,559
uh inflexible developers see security as

690
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,679
a blocker

691
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,360
right and uh and that's a problem

692
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,360
uh security and tech debt will grow

693
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,679
sometimes engineering fights to backlog

694
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,880
security

695
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,960
and sometimes findings are swept under

696
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,880
the rug right if you give

697
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
there's only so much latitude you can

698
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,720
give your developers if you give them

699
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,520
enough

700
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,200
permissions to um to ignore a finding

701
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,440
or to claim that a finding is not an

702
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
issue um is that is that too much

703
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,080
latitude

704
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,480
are they going to just say that all

705
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,080
things are not issues

706
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,520
right so this is a this is a challenge

707
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,080
and uh there's a lot to consider here

708
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,159
and that mountain is starting to look

709
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,640
really big for app second ed

710
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
he's starting to get a little nervous it

711
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
seems impossible

712
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,559
but um we're going to talk about

713
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,760
how to summon right and and what we can

714
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,240
do

715
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,600
and how we can climb that mountain uh

716
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,080
ned

717
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
is uh apparently he's he's still at base

718
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,360
camp so

719
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,760
he's having fun um like mitch hadberg

720
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,480
says

721
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,760
uh base camp is fun

722
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,240
but ned has to climb the mountain

723
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,880
so just starting out he has a lot of

724
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,399
energy to tackle some of these big

725
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,719
things

726
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,520
again ned's directives he wanted to

727
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
ensure that all code bases

728
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,520
are secure including all open source

729
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,559
software

730
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,000
he wanted to ensure that all future

731
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
development is secure

732
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,720
and again his board wants him to shift

733
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,960
left with future development

734
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,520
he has to train software developers and

735
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,360
secure coding practices

736
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
minimize attack vectors in external

737
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,720
facing applications

738
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,679
these are all um ned's directives passed

739
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,039
down from the board

740
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,320
uh he you know he has his his industry

741
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
challenges but then he also has to worry

742
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,200
about

743
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,039
the challenges we've discussed building

744
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,440
up this mountain

745
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,159
basically that come along with being a

746
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,200
big organization

747
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
so let's talk about shifting left if you

748
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
haven't heard this term

749
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
basically shifting left is the idea that

750
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
you involve

751
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,840
security earlier on

752
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,279
in the uh sd um the software development

753
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,000
life cycle

754
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,399
right sdlc so the idea being that uh

755
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,240
the earlier you involve your security

756
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,840
team in this uh

757
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,440
entire process the better right

758
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,640
and so here's here's kind of just uh

759
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,000
talking about ned's environment

760
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,159
in a lot of corporate environments

761
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,000
here's kind of a typical setup

762
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,159
right your software security scanning

763
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,039
tools sit

764
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,000
between tests and acceptance um you know

765
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,279
pre-production

766
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,679
and you're scanning and you're you know

767
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,320
you're

768
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,440
cycling back from here

769
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,000
back earlier on to the code phase and

770
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,159
you're going back and forth here

771
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,120
you have stuff out in production if you

772
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,679
have a web application firewall

773
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,399
i have yet to work for a company that

774
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,320
had a web application firewall

775
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
in block mode just sitting there in

776
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,919
block mode because

777
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,840
uh it was blocking too many legitimate

778
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,279
requests

779
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,480
most companies um have a laugh

780
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,360
in a monitor mode and that is where it

781
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,919
takes in

782
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,159
logs and it's logging all the traffic

783
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,279
essentially

784
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,520
and then you have something on the back

785
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,399
end

786
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,440
tracking what a waf says is an issue

787
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,000
and determining whether it is or not you

788
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
have a person

789
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,679
or you've written a program to parse

790
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,279
these logs

791
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,519
but a lot of waffs are sitting there in

792
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,960
monitor mode

793
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,120
so this is a typical environment setup

794
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,519
right here

795
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,440
and let's real quick again the

796
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,279
challenges are old tooling mergers and

797
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,559
acquisitions new products and

798
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,600
technologies

799
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
workplace shifts and inflexible

800
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,720
developers

801
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,200
so let's let's talk about tooling right

802
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,640
how can ned

803
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,080
climb that part of the mountain here

804
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,399
uh can newer security tooling really

805
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,279
help with

806
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,039
speed uh the answer is a resounding yes

807
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,559
so i'm gonna introduce you to two

808
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,480
concepts here and maybe you've heard of

809
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,039
them

810
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,360
but i asked and rasp are two of the

811
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,679
newer security technologies

812
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,000
is an interactive application security

813
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,799
testing

814
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,960
and rasp is a runtime application

815
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,320
self-protection

816
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,279
basically you allow agents to instrument

817
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,480
the code bases

818
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,760
to both provide security against attacks

819
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,240
and allow for more expedient remediation

820
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,480
by pinpointing issues

821
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,399
let me talk more in detail about that

822
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,679
right

823
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,240
with an is solution you can detect

824
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,559
vulnerabilities with instrumentation

825
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
to observe applications as they run

826
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
during testing

827
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,919
you can assess the security of code user

828
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,799
interaction

829
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,600
user interaction libraries frameworks

830
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,080
back-end connections and configurations

831
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,760
and essentially perform continuous and

832
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,799
real-time application security

833
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,679
testing throughout the entire life cycle

834
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,559
this means that

835
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,559
developers get immediate feedback and

836
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,880
semi-solutions have

837
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,600
route intelligence basically completely

838
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,159
mapping

839
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,559
each route in the application when you

840
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,320
think about

841
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,960
pen testing right there's the old uh

842
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,159
there's the old

843
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,039
routing um when you're when you're

844
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,120
routing a web application backwards

845
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,320
right we're thinking

846
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,799
okay what are my avenues of attack and

847
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,360
how can i

848
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,480
attack this application um and i

849
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,679
and i ask solution routes it forwards so

850
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,640
it routes the entire thing from you know

851
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,440
from

852
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,159
initialization all the way to all the

853
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,159
different possibilities of

854
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,919
of where inputs you know occur and

855
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,880
what code touches what code and that

856
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
kind of thing

857
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,760
can really help when pinpointing issues

858
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,439
and rasp is another popular

859
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,679
modern application security tooling

860
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,159
rasp can detect and block exploitation

861
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,399
of software vulnerabilities

862
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,559
basically it can differentiate between

863
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,519
attack attempts

864
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,600
or probes that can impact an application

865
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
uh unlike a perimeter-based web

866
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,279
application firewall

867
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,919
uh let me give you an example of that

868
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,480
here's an example right you have two

869
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,360
different inputs

870
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,159
one is a your most common sql injection

871
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:52,960
attack

872
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,240
and one is your most common crosstalk

873
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,840
scripting attack

874
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,440
uh if this is your code where you're

875
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,360
essentially uh setting

876
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,559
a name right uh obviously

877
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,120
if you're familiar with um with

878
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,560
javascript

879
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,119
this is going to result in a cross-site

880
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,639
scripting alert

881
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,719
it won't result in a sql injection

882
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,679
you're not touching sql

883
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,359
so in this case rasp

884
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,239
actually instruments the code uh it sees

885
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,119
this input

886
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,599
it allows the input to go through but

887
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,359
once it gets

888
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,918
posted here back to the page that's

889
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,359
considered a sync

890
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,520
so it watches soars to sync and if

891
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,599
something if an input tries to escape a

892
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,879
sink boundary

893
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,480
it will flag on it so in this case

894
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,199
a waf might block both of these because

895
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,000
they both look

896
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,119
egregious but if you are

897
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,879
um if you are naming your team

898
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,680
uh after little bobby tables or just

899
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,240
having fun with an or one equals one

900
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,440
uh in this case um

901
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,280
it would be fine right i mean you have

902
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,560
no problem

903
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
taking this information and sticking it

904
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
in as a name

905
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,119
uh so uh rasp would watch this input

906
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,200
and it would not escape the sink

907
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,599
boundary and of course it would just

908
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,480
paste it into the name meanwhile input

909
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,760
number two here

910
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,000
that's a problem and grasp would flag on

911
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,160
it so that's why it can differentiate

912
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,560
between

913
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,040
attack attempts and attacks that have

914
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,079
actual impact

915
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,119
right um it can also

916
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,880
protect application runtime environments

917
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,119
from unwanted changes and tampering

918
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,760
uh and again we're tracing attack

919
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,839
attempts from source to sync

920
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,640
uh so here's here's kind of some stats

921
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,240
to back this up right this is

922
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,400
a um this is from contrast and vera code

923
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,680
the percent of vulnerabilities closed

924
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,240
within one month of discovery

925
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,359
nearly 60 percent almost double

926
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,760
of the vulnerabilities found with rasp

927
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,560
tools

928
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,920
are closed versus a sas tool

929
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
and you might not say why is that well

930
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,280
the reason is because rasp can more

931
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,800
accurately tell you

932
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,359
um exactly what the problem is and you

933
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,560
have data to

934
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,079
actually uh track source to sync

935
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,960
uh and then also you close more

936
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,640
vulnerabilities with rasp

937
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
faster i mean that's essentially what

938
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,839
we're saying here uh

939
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,040
rasp um has only 32

940
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,480
remaining after that three months of

941
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
discovery remember at the beginning i

942
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:38,960
said

943
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
industry-wide the average remediation

944
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,079
time is 171 days

945
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,440
so after three months you know if you

946
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
only have 30 percent

947
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,280
left of your vulnerabilities you've

948
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,240
closed 70

949
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,720
you're shortening that time that window

950
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,160
which is great

951
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,119
uh meanwhile sas still has over half

952
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,640
their vulnerabilities have yet to be

953
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,880
remediated after three months

954
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,920
so as you can see definitely

955
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,680
um using modern technology and modern

956
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,560
tooling

957
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,520
can definitely have a big impact on your

958
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,079
vulnerability remediation

959
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,160
so i'd like to propose maybe shifting

960
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,520
out right

961
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,560
uh where you're shifting left still

962
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
but you're also shifting right where

963
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
you're moving some of your tooling into

964
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,680
production

965
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,560
like rasp uh you can also with with

966
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,839
something like rasp it's easier to

967
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,440
tune your waff into block mode

968
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,640
right you can um you can remove a lot of

969
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,200
the

970
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,320
you can use a simpler rule set

971
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,560
a more egregious rule set and turn it on

972
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,760
into block mode

973
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,599
and then rasp you know is also there to

974
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,960
protect against stuff that isn't

975
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,160
in your waf rules that and you can shift

976
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,800
left

977
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,599
and involve i asked in development right

978
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,960
is going to provide

979
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,720
feedback to developers while they're

980
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,079
working in their ides

981
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,119
and testing uh testing and routing

982
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,200
their own code so as they're testing a

983
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,160
new feature

984
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,079
you know you could get is feedback

985
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,839
already so now you're

986
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,400
now you're involving security super

987
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,640
early on in the in the design phase

988
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,200
but also in production right so you're

989
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,079
shifting out

990
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,920
um each way and you're there's um

991
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,280
uh this can only benefit you

992
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,000
so that feels pretty good about that and

993
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,800
he's made his

994
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,960
he's made some progress ned thinks that

995
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,720
he has a good

996
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,119
idea of where to go with old tooling um

997
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,240
but he

998
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,359
he still has a long way to go right he's

999
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,760
this is i think a mordor uh from lord of

1000
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,680
the rings

1001
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,320
they got you know they get on top of one

1002
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,760
little mountain but they still have a

1003
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,160
long way to go

1004
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,400
so let's talk a little bit about mergers

1005
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,359
and acquisitions

1006
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,240
uh in in my mind this is the most

1007
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,160
obvious

1008
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,280
solution but the hardest

1009
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,560
solution because

1010
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,160
you're essentially having to convince

1011
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,640
your executive level staff

1012
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,280
that you need to get apsec more involved

1013
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,839
in a m

1014
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,640
a discovery earlier you you heard me

1015
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:22,960
tell

1016
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,920
an anecdote about how i worked for a

1017
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,640
company

1018
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,760
where we acquired a um a company

1019
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,480
and didn't didn't even get to check them

1020
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:32,800
out

1021
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,520
until after we acquired them and had

1022
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,720
their software

1023
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,000
in-house it could only be

1024
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,200
positive if appsec is more involved

1025
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,520
during the discovery phase let's think

1026
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,880
about this right

1027
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,160
if ned discovers that something is amiss

1028
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,240
i mean theoretically you can use that as

1029
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,000
a negotiation tactic

1030
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,880
your c-suite uh and your negotiators can

1031
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,359
lower

1032
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,079
total pricing if they say hey we're

1033
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,359
going to have to fix

1034
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,760
a bunch of your security issues this is

1035
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,960
a problem

1036
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
um also it's going to give

1037
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,160
ned the leverage to demand more head

1038
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,839
count if you think about it

1039
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,960
and if ned's team is able to identify

1040
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,560
security issues

1041
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,160
and it's able to potentially

1042
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,280
lower total cost

1043
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,960
then you um you have the ability to uh

1044
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,640
save the company money and and also tell

1045
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,040
them

1046
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,760
this is going to require more work so i

1047
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,599
need more people

1048
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,520
so and if ned if ned discovers uh

1049
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,200
uh nothing egregious then he can begin

1050
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,920
planning on onboarding i mean that you

1051
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,400
know

1052
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,319
that'll at least give them a little edge

1053
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,839
on onboarding

1054
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,040
so uh overall you know this can only be

1055
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,760
positive

1056
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,440
because involving involving uh

1057
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,640
apsec is either gonna save you money or

1058
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,839
give net a jump start

1059
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
but you do have to convince the c-suite

1060
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,200
which is

1061
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,720
again that's what i found to be one of

1062
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,000
the bigger challenges

1063
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,359
but that ned feels like hey you know

1064
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,520
it if i'm he's able to talk to his

1065
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,640
c-suite

1066
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,960
and convince them using the the old

1067
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,560
adage that money talks

1068
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,960
um you know and and we're going to

1069
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,400
either save money or

1070
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,520
save time uh by involving

1071
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,560
my team so ned is not quite at the

1072
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,000
midway point but he's making some

1073
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,800
serious progress now so let's talk about

1074
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,920
new products and new technologies

1075
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,079
how can ned contain this ever-growing

1076
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,160
landscape of products for developers

1077
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,200
it's sprawling right and it's not going

1078
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,079
to go well if you

1079
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,760
tell developers that you're taking away

1080
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
their ability to innovate

1081
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,520
right you can't you can't say to a

1082
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,200
development team like i'm taking away

1083
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,480
all of your administrative

1084
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,119
privileges because you you want to write

1085
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,760
something

1086
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,040
using rust that's terrible that

1087
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,440
like that's that'll weigh in later

1088
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,240
during this uh

1089
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,280
development apsec relationship you know

1090
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,640
uh again i want to hammer this point

1091
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,359
home

1092
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,280
we don't want to discourage innovation

1093
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
we want to encourage consideration

1094
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,960
so how can the appsec team work with the

1095
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
development teams

1096
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,240
and and their managers in order to

1097
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,359
basically basically create an acceptable

1098
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,760
well to create an acceptable use policy

1099
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
here so

1100
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,240
uh ned is going to he's going to create

1101
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,520
this policy

1102
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,880
and it's and adding to it

1103
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,040
is easy but it needs to be reviewed by

1104
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,359
an enterprise architecture review board

1105
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,040
or an er um so essentially ned's going

1106
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,240
to go through and he's going to white

1107
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,760
list a bunch of technologies that you

1108
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,480
can use

1109
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,040
and if you want to add a new technology

1110
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,640
you just propose it to this

1111
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,079
eorb board right and uh

1112
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,200
the er board um basically their mission

1113
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
is to provide a strategic approach to

1114
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,359
innovate technology-based solutions

1115
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,920
by maintaining an optimal consistent set

1116
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,319
of standardized best practices

1117
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,800
so essentially they want to review the

1118
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,400
new technology that you're bringing in

1119
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,119
determine if we have a solution where we

1120
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,079
can

1121
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,640
cover its security support it's the

1122
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,400
support its use

1123
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,680
and uh and they want to be able to

1124
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,200
accelerate the time to market

1125
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,839
on the product so this is something

1126
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,760
that's enforceable then by compliance

1127
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,200
and it's going to take advantage of that

1128
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
compliance team that i mentioned

1129
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,000
uh in the beginning as one of his uh is

1130
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
one of his

1131
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,560
climbing tools so the compliance will

1132
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,760
enforce this

1133
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,880
um this list but

1134
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,839
adding to it is easy enough so uh we

1135
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,560
want to

1136
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,240
again allow developers to innovate

1137
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,920
but we want to make sure that they're

1138
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
aware that you know

1139
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,760
their innovation is going to affect the

1140
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,599
company in some way and so we need a

1141
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,599
team to review that

1142
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,720
if we check in on ned he has now uh he

1143
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,920
has now

1144
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,599
conquered three out of the five

1145
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,440
challenges

1146
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,119
let's talk real quickly about the

1147
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,480
workplace shift or the departed

1148
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,720
this happens it's not always fun and not

1149
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,560
always with much notice

1150
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,200
uh if ned doesn't have advanced warning

1151
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,880
of a relocation or layoff

1152
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,800
there's a few things that he can prepare

1153
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,920
ahead of time

1154
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,000
uh you may or may not have heard of burn

1155
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,280
lists uh

1156
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,839
basically uh it's a list of user

1157
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,480
accounts

1158
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,599
and where they exist this can be vast

1159
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,160
and take

1160
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,400
a significant amount of time but the

1161
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
sooner ned can automate it the better

1162
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,560
so you'll want to make sure that you are

1163
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,400
aware of all of the

1164
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,760
user accounts that you're going to have

1165
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
to take you're going to have to remove

1166
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,359
the security operations are going to

1167
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,280
remove their you know

1168
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,319
their microsoft outlook access their vpn

1169
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,440
access but

1170
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
you want to make sure to also make sure

1171
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,760
to also remove any application

1172
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,880
credentials uh that they have also um

1173
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,880
this is an interesting one that not many

1174
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,240
people do i found

1175
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,200
a default credentials sweep uh i worked

1176
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,160
at a company

1177
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,440
in the early 2000s that has

1178
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,680
a default credential in their production

1179
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,200
environment so

1180
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,040
it's it's a credential that developers

1181
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
use to develop

1182
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,760
uh and uh it's still out there so

1183
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,000
ned creates a default cred sweep

1184
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,760
basically ensuring that any testing

1185
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,640
credentials

1186
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,879
don't make it up into production so

1187
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,400
uh workplace shift um

1188
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
so what about new employees right i mean

1189
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,240
that's how to handle the departed and

1190
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,280
try to

1191
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,640
you know retain that um knowledge and

1192
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,079
worry about you know a disgruntled

1193
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,079
employee but uh

1194
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,400
what about new employees well ned has to

1195
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,079
use a training platform that works

1196
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,480
remotely and is easy to distribute

1197
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,079
it's important that any new employee go

1198
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,359
through secure software development

1199
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,359
training before they touch code

1200
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,680
so he makes it part of the onboarding

1201
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,680
process

1202
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,760
ned also creates documentation around

1203
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,319
standard best coding practices uh

1204
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,040
this is something that um kind of

1205
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,240
revolutionized uh

1206
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,599
a company that i was working at where um

1207
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,520
his team stubbed out authentication

1208
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,760
session management api requests

1209
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,079
database connections and more like you

1210
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,760
just wrote code

1211
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,000
snippets that worked for this language

1212
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,839
that you knew was secure

1213
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,280
and is in common use so

1214
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,520
that team like let's say it's net right

1215
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,800
you write out a dotnet

1216
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,640
um authentication uh and a.net session

1217
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,920
management sub

1218
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,720
and your.net team if they're onboarding

1219
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,319
someone and they say like hey

1220
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,319
you need to add authentication just go

1221
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,000
over here and check out that

1222
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,480
stub that's already ready to go you can

1223
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,760
just go grab it

1224
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,599
so uh

1225
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,119
again i'm doing checking on ned ned's

1226
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,560
doing great he's near the top of the

1227
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,760
mountain

1228
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,599
he's uh high enough to appreciate the

1229
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,839
view but not comfortable yet

1230
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,880
uh this is the big one right inflexible

1231
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,760
developers

1232
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,760
um application for that fighting

1233
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,520
engineering is a fight where everybody

1234
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,480
loses

1235
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,440
if you remember uh the old movie war

1236
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,720
games

1237
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,960
the only way to win the game is not to

1238
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,079
play

1239
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,800
so uh there are several things that can

1240
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,720
improve the relationship

1241
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
first off application security should be

1242
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,480
housed outside the engineering group

1243
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,599
either under a ciso cio or cfo

1244
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,599
you need to create a separation of

1245
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,000
priorities among engineering management

1246
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,240
engineers should not be able to say no

1247
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,760
to something that you deem

1248
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,319
a critical security fix it's also

1249
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,000
important to reiterate that application

1250
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,640
security is a resource not a hindrance

1251
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,000
it's not a blocker

1252
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,319
after all your developers don't want to

1253
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,119
push vulnerable code

1254
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,119
application security engineers should

1255
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,800
have development experience in my

1256
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,839
opinion uh this this set

1257
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,440
the twitter world of flame when somebody

1258
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,040
tweeted this uh

1259
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,359
it was like last year but uh they think

1260
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,160
that

1261
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,480
you know application security developers

1262
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,920
in particular should have development

1263
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,839
experience

1264
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,240
um or extensive experience with code

1265
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,680
i think the best way to become an

1266
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,359
application security developer

1267
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,319
is to be a developer first and then you

1268
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:28,640
know

1269
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,920
gain the security experience and move

1270
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,960
into security

1271
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,000
and application security so uh

1272
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,040
why is that important well think about

1273
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,400
how you can endear yourself to

1274
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,040
developers right you

1275
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,800
it should be a partnership between the

1276
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,040
appsec team and the development team

1277
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,800
um and think about ways you can you know

1278
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,720
endear yourself um training can be fun

1279
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,559
you could gamify competitions i've

1280
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,880
hosted ctf competitions

1281
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,000
for my development teams uh it can

1282
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,640
help bond each other uh it can help the

1283
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,599
dev team

1284
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,720
you know learn and um that you are

1285
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,359
an expert in your field uh you can do

1286
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:11,839
secure

1287
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,000
coding hackathons lunch and learn

1288
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,400
sessions q a sessions uh

1289
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,960
provide launch once a month uh joint

1290
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,559
outings include development and team

1291
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,280
outings

1292
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,599
i mean this is this is crucial right

1293
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,119
it's a partnership

1294
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,040
right it you should if you're an

1295
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,400
application team member

1296
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,559
and you work with you know lots of

1297
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,640
developers in the same office

1298
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,119
post covid let's say uh you should be

1299
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,559
having lunch with them you should be

1300
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,240
seeing them on a regular basis

1301
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,319
making friends with them because working

1302
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,839
with working with

1303
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,960
people like that is going to make

1304
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,000
your relationship uh less combative

1305
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,359
and more of a partnership right uh

1306
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,240
ned happens to buy his uh he buys pizza

1307
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,119
once a month so

1308
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,520
man's over there eating pizza so if you

1309
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,319
look at uh

1310
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,960
ned he's he's um i think he's

1311
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,000
accomplished all his

1312
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
his directives right he's ensured that

1313
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,520
all current code bases are secure

1314
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,960
including open source

1315
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,760
software uh he's uh ensure future

1316
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,079
development is secure he's shifted out

1317
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,559
with future development uh he's trained

1318
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,160
software developers in secure coding

1319
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,280
practices

1320
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
and uh minimized attack vectors and

1321
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,040
external facing applications

1322
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,599
so at this point ned i'm gonna call it

1323
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,480
ned's and then

1324
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,760
summited the mountain um i wrapped it up

1325
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,400
about

1326
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,200
53 so i have about seven minutes for

1327
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,559
questions and comments

1328
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,960
please drop them in uh in discord and

1329
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,559
i'll answer them

1330
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,720
a german poster of the new guy uh

1331
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,319
believe it or not i couldn't find

1332
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,599
a good uh suited

1333
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,800
suitable for work poster uh

1334
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,119
from america so yeah it's a german one

1335
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,319
uh let's see open question what's the

1336
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,520
best rasp tool

1337
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,720
do you think is out there in your honest

1338
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,800
opinion also same with the i asked

1339
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,000
tools uh well brian

1340
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,119
and wobblebox um i work for a company

1341
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,640
that provides

1342
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,880
both is and rasp and i work on the team

1343
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,400
that helps drive the

1344
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,800
um innovation and product so i don't

1345
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,160
think that's a very fair question

1346
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:14,960
because

1347
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,599
uh i'm gonna i'm gonna answer it one way

1348
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,920
and i don't want this to turn into a uh

1349
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,920
a product supported talk so

1350
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,400
i i know that rasp and is tools there

1351
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,319
are several out there

1352
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,720
i know that if you are looking at an is

1353
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,920
tool i would encourage

1354
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,440
one that does complete route

1355
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,680
intelligence because i think that that's

1356
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,760
going to provide the best coverage

1357
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,720
when you're looking at rasp tools i

1358
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,160
think that configuration

1359
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,319
is important and

1360
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,079
i think that configuration is important

1361
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,520
and um

1362
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,920
and so i think that something that

1363
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,960
allows you to

1364
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,160
kind of uh tune your own rule sets

1365
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,280
is uh is important because um you're

1366
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,000
unique

1367
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,920
in business environment or your unique

1368
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,680
business unit uh is going to have

1369
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,480
different rules

1370
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,040
than you know somebody else's business

1371
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,760
unit so

1372
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,200
you're going to need to be able to say

1373
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,520
like this is important to me or that

1374
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,440
i want to put this into monitor mode or

1375
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,119
block mode kind of thing

1376
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,119
um i think that you're going to want

1377
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,720
something that's uh continually

1378
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,720
innovating

1379
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,480
and has future focused mindsets so

1380
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,800
i know that my company does that um but

1381
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,720
i'm not going to

1382
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,720
you know compare with other other

1383
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,240
companies

1384
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,599
