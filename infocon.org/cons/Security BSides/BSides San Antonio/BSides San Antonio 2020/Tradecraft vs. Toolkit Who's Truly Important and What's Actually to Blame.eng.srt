1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
uh this is tradecrafters toolkit who's

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
actually important and what's

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,359
actually to blame i'd like to give a

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,760
special thanks to the b-sides team

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,440
for giving this opportunity to speak

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,120
with you today

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,320
this presentation is born from an

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
experience of developing operators and

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,160
comparing their skills against security

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,720
products

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,880
and then relying on people at the end of

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,000
the day to solve those problems

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,760
so let's talk about what brings us here

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,680
for this one how many times have you

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,399
heard

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
something similar to this that we've

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
invested in the most cutting edge

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,879
security suite available now we'll be

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,800
safer

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,399
what do you mean we had a breach why

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
didn't the system catch it

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,239
i mean obviously the tools are

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
ineffective if my new hire

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,719
can't catch and stop everything from day

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
one

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,559
well netappy didn't work so

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,399
um guess the site's secure

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,600
hopefully you haven't heard the last one

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,880
too often uh tools don't only become a

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,760
crutch

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,799
for the analysts and the operators but

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
they also unjustly receive a lot of

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,080
blame as to

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,880
the reason that a team isn't enough

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
isn't effective

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,080
so why are detections why are

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,119
mitigations

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,159
failing in this age of unprecedented

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,400
technology

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
what should we do whenever the exploit

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,320
just

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,600
doesn't work on that pin test

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
in each of these situations the

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,159
development of each individual's or the

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,759
team's overall tradecraft

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,360
that's what will determine the success

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,439
for the failure

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,479
so this talk focuses on the importance

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,240
of developing people

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,799
and their abilities to create a more

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,840
efficient

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
and effective crew we're going to

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,119
discuss

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
when tool reliance is appropriate and

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
when it's a hindrance

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,920
now this is not any sort of rebuke on

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,119
tools or their usage and no tools be

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
called out specifically

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
but this is a discussion on

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,120
the importance of skilled professionals

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
so getting into this what we'll be going

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,959
over here

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,480
is we're going to define tradecraft

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
the necessities of the industry as you

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
can see the bullet points here

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,440
now this is intended to apply to

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,640
blue red purple white

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
black gray beige defenders

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
aggressors developers

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,480
professionals in general

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
we will define tradecraft so i'm not

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,760
going to spend too much time confusing

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,799
everyone on all of that

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
oh

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,280
yeah looks like i have backed up here

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,319
sorry

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,879
tech problem's always great right so

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,319
i'll also hit on what i'll refer to as

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,200
the necessities

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
of the cyber security industry these are

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,040
going to be tools

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,239
and people and then from there we're

83
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,680
going to quickly discuss a few of the

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
challenges

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
that are presented by an overly

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
tool-reliant approach to security

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,239
now that's going to help set up the next

88
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
bit where the value of investing in

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,040
personal

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,120
professional growth and skill

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
development will be highlighted

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
a fair warning on that it gets a bit so

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,959
boxy

94
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,799
uh don't worry i'll try not to be too

95
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,959
preachy

96
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,480
whole thing we're going to top off with

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
kind of a proposed road map to success

98
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
this is merely suggestion or possibly

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,480
starting point

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,599
there's no end-all be-all solution

101
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,799
so let's dive in so first

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,519
who am i well i am wall-e like the robot

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,480
although sometimes i am the walrus

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
now so i'm a cyber i am a calibrator

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,319
turned cyber security specialist

106
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,040
um i conduct defensive server operations

107
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,879
for the united states air force

108
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,480
i have several responsibilities in this

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,798
role some of the most notable

110
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,918
of these are cyber threat emulation

111
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,199
cyber readiness which is to say network

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
and vulnerability mapping and analytics

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
conducting training and weapons and

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,080
tactics which

115
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
sounds much fancier than what it is a

116
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,199
lot of documentation

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,440
but enough rattling on about myself

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,840
that's not why any of you are actually

119
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,000
here

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
i say tradecraft what am i talking about

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,919
most people when they hear the word

122
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,360
think of spies

123
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
and who can vote one definition

124
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
is definitely the techniques and

125
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,560
procedures of espionage

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
but obviously this is not what i mean

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,039
the definition that i'm leveraging

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,479
is skill acquired through experience in

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,080
a trade

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,240
notice that it's not aptitude through

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
training

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
it's skill through experience

133
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,759
this is critical to understanding what

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,000
this discussion is about

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
training is a key component and i don't

136
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,639
want to discount the value of it

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,160
everyone needs foundational knowledge

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
but it's experience that is the

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,080
solidifier of that

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,919
skilled personnel are vital to the

141
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,520
success of any venture

142
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,880
and they're the greatest asset available

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
so when i speak of industry necessities

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,120
i'm referencing technology and people

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
we deal with technology so we need it

146
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,639
right

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
i will generally use the word tool to

148
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,479
reference software

149
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
platforms technology scripts

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
and so forth tools are absolutely

151
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,639
necessary

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,080
as networks grow in scale complexity

153
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
and geographic disparity the ability to

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
defend

155
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,039
test or attack everything necessary with

156
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,960
just a handful of people

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,440
and the command line becomes less

158
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
realistic

159
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,039
at the very least it becomes less

160
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,720
effective

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
we have to be able to leverage and rely

162
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,280
upon the hard work of others

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,560
now while technology is a necessity so

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,199
to our

165
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,840
operators and analysts with solid trade

166
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,199
craft

167
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,639
one might even argue that they are more

168
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
important

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
who makes the who do you think makes the

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,159
tools

171
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
we've all seen through reports of

172
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
breaches and compromise

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,479
the impact of failing to make people

174
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,479
skilled in the art of security

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
for the sake of making them tool jockeys

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
so bar for an old commander of mine

177
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,599
we don't want to reduce our operators to

178
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,840
push button get banana

179
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,520
a tool jockey only knows how to push the

180
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,400
button and then becomes paralyzed or

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,520
panicked when there is no banana or

182
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,319
worse

183
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
doesn't go grow concerned that the

184
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
banana stopped appearing

185
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,680
as long as the button works everything's

186
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,919
fine you get the banana

187
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,280
what happens when the button doesn't

188
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,240
work how do you get the banana now

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
are you even sure the button is giving

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,319
you as many as it should

191
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,440
or even as many as it could this is

192
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,759
where you need your skilled operators

193
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,120
these are going to be your people who

194
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,759
can fix the tool or

195
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,720
get the banana another way or even

196
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,440
double check

197
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,319
that you're getting the right bananas in

198
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,960
the right amount

199
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,120
so we're going to break up the idea of

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,000
skill operators a little bit more here

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
so remember how i said the tradecraft is

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
skill through experience

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,720
not every skilled operator can do

204
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,080
everything

205
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,560
there are a few that can but they're

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,080
rare

207
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,319
the skilled analyst takes many forms

208
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,440
some of which

209
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
i'll present here and we're gonna expand

210
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
on a couple of the most prominent

211
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,759
those being the three highlighted on

212
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,280
screen

213
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
i keep in mind that these are just my

214
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,120
interpretations

215
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
of skill sets and they're in no way

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,520
definitive or inclusive

217
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,199
so starting off some of your most

218
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,039
valuable talent are

219
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,400
the tool champions they use the tool

220
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,159
but they also know how to leverage it

221
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,599
more efficiently

222
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,360
and more effectively this is the talent

223
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,839
that's

224
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,799
able to troubleshoot like lightning and

225
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,200
tune out the false results

226
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,279
they set themselves apart from the tool

227
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
jockey by understanding how the tool

228
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,959
does what it does

229
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
and by being able to do the same thing

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,000
temporarily

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
when the tool fails albeit less

232
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
efficiently

233
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,760
you can trust their setup and the

234
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,399
results that it produces

235
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,519
often your tool champions are the they

236
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,880
that you will tap

237
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
to train others because you trust their

238
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
expertise

239
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,920
these individuals keep their finger on

240
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
the pulse of capabilities

241
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,920
and can provide expert recommendations

242
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,839
on what to use to best accomplish your

243
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,440
objectives

244
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
your tool champions work hand in hand

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
with what i call the concept of depths

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
these are your lead hacksaws you're

247
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,720
lethal for instigators

248
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
this is the gal who reads assembly for

249
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
fun the them that develops the new

250
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
covert channels

251
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,200
or the guy who solves a memory forensic

252
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
ctf challenge

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,760
via them and that is a true story by the

254
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
way

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
there are also those individuals who can

256
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,959
put together a team of complimentary

257
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,920
skill sets

258
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,480
they can guide them to a 70 solution and

259
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,800
save the day

260
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
this is who's going to get tapped to

261
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
provide the expertise

262
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,200
to build out technological functionality

263
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,519
your concept adapts they're going to be

264
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,880
your signature authors

265
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,240
they're going to be your exploit writers

266
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,040
now i need to stress here you don't have

267
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,000
to be an absolute

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,959
master to be a valuable concept adept

269
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,920
filling this role requires a solid

270
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
conceptual understanding

271
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
and an ability to implement concepts in

272
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,839
real world scenarios

273
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,680
now no one ever knows everything right i

274
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,120
can't say that i've heard of anyone

275
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
knowing everything they need

276
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
without some sort of outside influence

277
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
or research

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
your training gurus will get your people

279
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,040
to where they need to be

280
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,000
it's a skilled and trusted role and it's

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,279
vital to any long-term success

282
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,680
these individuals understand not only

283
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,040
the technology

284
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,000
but also the people behind and in front

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,839
of it

286
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,920
this is who's going to be trusted to

287
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,880
develop

288
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,760
and also deliver solid improvement in

289
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
the people that you

290
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,160
and your team rely on

291
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,760
we'll get to our road map of success

292
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
later on but

293
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,600
who do you who do you think is a

294
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
cornerstone of guiding people in the

295
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
right direction

296
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
to speak frankly this is often one of

297
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,680
the most underappreciated roles

298
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,680
while also being one of the most vital

299
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,519
so knowing what we're working with what

300
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,600
happens when the overall approach is too

301
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
too reliant well the excuses flow like

302
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
electrons through cat7

303
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
we have too many tools so our operators

304
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,279
aren't able to be effective

305
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,600
the technology doesn't work the software

306
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
isn't doing the job i expect

307
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,600
i can't get the data retrieved for

308
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
analysis

309
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
we're suffering from alert fatigue so we

310
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
missed that critical event

311
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
i couldn't get that metasploit module to

312
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,600
work so i just didn't test it

313
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,160
so what can be done about this

314
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
well did you ever look into why you have

315
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,160
those tools in the first place

316
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,800
was that technology even meant to work

317
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
the way that

318
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
you're trying to use it

319
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
do you have the right thing for this

320
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
are you sure these are not the droids i

321
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,199
mean data sets you're looking for

322
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,279
what if you didn't look at everything

323
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,800
but then you just looked at the stuff

324
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,120
that

325
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,839
mattered and is metasploit really the

326
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,800
only way to conduct a pin test

327
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,360
so a tool champion could have told you

328
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
don't use that tool

329
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,240
because you're not going to get memory

330
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
information from a nids

331
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
your training guru would have taught you

332
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
or sure hope

333
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
should have taught you that you should

334
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
not try to run volatility on a dead disc

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,639
to retrieve pcap

336
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
a concept adept could have given you a

337
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
new or a different exploit to get that

338
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,639
critical finding

339
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,680
that you needed in that pen test

340
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
the right script could have easily

341
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,680
weeded out some of those known benign

342
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
alerts from your spreadsheet

343
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
which would have allowed your analyst to

344
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
focus more

345
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,760
on the actual anomalous behavior

346
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
and the potentially malicious

347
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,920
focusing too heavily on the toolkit

348
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
without the complimentary refinement of

349
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
tradecraft

350
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,800
introduces a myriad of issues

351
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,320
how much time is wasted in training to

352
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
learn a new system

353
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,560
even though it does the same job as the

354
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,639
tools you already have

355
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,480
countless man hours being lost as you

356
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
train entire departments on something

357
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,920
different that just does the same thing

358
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,399
in a

359
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,519
slightly different way how long does it

360
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,600
take to get performance back up to an

361
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,959
effective level

362
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,760
after introducing a new platform you've

363
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,279
lost the time in the training already

364
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:07,760
but it

365
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,800
doesn't stop there every system

366
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
every process it has an accompanying

367
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,240
learning curve

368
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,720
that still has to be worked through that

369
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,839
will slow people

370
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,079
down

371
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
your experienced analysts become

372
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,079
overworked

373
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,959
because the work still needs to be done

374
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,800
but now those tool jockeys

375
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,120
don't have the ability to function

376
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,399
because you've yanked to the crutch out

377
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,199
from underneath them

378
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,680
forcing one or two people to do the work

379
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,199
of 20

380
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,440
isn't going to go well for efficiency it

381
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
won't be effective

382
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,079
and even worse is when they're expected

383
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:46,560
to do

384
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,399
all of this while they're teaching their

385
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,760
peers

386
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,959
overburdening skill is the

387
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,720
quick a very quick way to lose talent

388
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
now that you have everyone focused on

389
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
learning each new piece of tech

390
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,800
that is constantly being placed or

391
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,839
refreshed

392
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,800
or augmented where are your operators

393
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
gaining the experience that they need to

394
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
develop that skill

395
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,079
who's carrying your operations into the

396
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,680
future

397
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,399
you can't rely on the same experienced

398
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,279
people

399
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,040
forever humans quit go on vacation

400
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,560
get fired retire get sick and cease to

401
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,399
be able to work for a variety of reasons

402
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,720
the replacements they have to come from

403
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,199
somewhere

404
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,959
so how many non-problems have been

405
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,079
solved

406
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,440
quote unquote buy new features

407
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,279
instead of buying that new av maybe you

408
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,440
should look at tuning your edr

409
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
and your sword to respond to the

410
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,759
situations you're worried about

411
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
there's always a likelihood that you

412
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,959
aren't catching events

413
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,479
because events aren't even occurring

414
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,279
luckily a skilled team can help you

415
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,360
figure that out

416
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
how many of those so-called problems

417
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
or how many actual problems we're caused

418
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,639
by the new features

419
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,759
if you don't have the knowledgeable

420
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
people you're introducing a greater

421
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,360
chance for unexpected errors due to

422
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,959
technological incompatibility

423
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,399
so what happens when and i do mean when

424
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,759
the technology fails if all of your

425
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,680
focus was on using the tool

426
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,440
and now it's gone what do you do

427
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,440
is it just time to pack up and go home

428
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,160
while a malfunction an error or a crash

429
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,880
can

430
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,079
definitely create a work stoppage

431
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,839
it shouldn't be the case every time

432
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,800
wouldn't it be great

433
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,480
if someone was able to continue getting

434
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,079
the job done

435
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,639
even if not at the same pace as the tool

436
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,800
but until that functionality comes back

437
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,240
you're still moving forward

438
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,400
and then worst of all if all you know

439
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,359
are the tools

440
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,319
and nobody knows the concepts underneath

441
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,799
well then

442
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,880
how do you know that you've found or

443
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
you've missed bad

444
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,880
how do you know that you've tested the

445
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,119
vulnerabilities to which the client is

446
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,520
most susceptible

447
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,359
so someone once asked the question which

448
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,679
is worse false positives or false

449
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
negatives

450
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,039
almost universally the response is false

451
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,520
negatives i can't say universally

452
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,000
because there may

453
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,080
have been a troll or two trying to spark

454
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
an argument

455
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
but why would so strongly the false

456
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,160
negatives come back as the resounding

457
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,840
answer

458
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
because missing the bad thing is much

459
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,960
less damaging

460
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,720
than investigating the benign thing

461
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,160
so you've been trained to id what

462
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
someone else calls bad

463
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,720
but this company you're working with or

464
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
the working company you're working for

465
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
is forced to use those practices

466
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,360
legacy systems can sometimes require

467
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,799
legacy configurations

468
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,640
that newer technology just doesn't

469
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
understand

470
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,960
with all of this it's going to be

471
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,679
experience more than anything else that

472
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
really helps discern the malicious

473
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
anomalies

474
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,399
from the night

475
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,240
so what should you do or what should we

476
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
do as an industry

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
well invest in personal

478
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,679
technical growth if you run the place

479
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,200
grow your people they get the job done

480
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
if you aren't in management or in

481
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,400
leadership

482
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,600
or i'd even say if you are improve

483
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,720
yourself

484
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,000
because you also get the job done

485
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,080
growth can be fostered in a variety of

486
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,200
ways

487
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,640
everyone always thinks about going to

488
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
training but that's not the only

489
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,919
solution

490
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,000
creating opportunities for yourself and

491
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,080
others is one of the greatest methods of

492
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
refining your skill set

493
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,559
these opportunities should include but

494
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,120
obviously you're not limited to

495
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,840
hands-on experience leadership

496
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
opportunities

497
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,760
and even opportunities to fail

498
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,799
allowing failure fosters growth

499
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,760
controlled failure leads to fuzzing we

500
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,160
have an

501
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,880
entire section of industry dedicated to

502
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
breaking

503
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,640
so we have to try and manage risk not

504
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,240
let the fear of it paralyze us

505
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
the organizational toolkit should

506
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
include a minimum of numbers

507
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
and minimum number of skilled personnel

508
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,160
in critical roles

509
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
make sure that the team loadout is

510
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,679
postured for success

511
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,000
and groom the newer members towards

512
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
those roles you're going to need

513
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,919
long term as security specialists

514
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,520
you'll find yourself in a variety of

515
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,280
unique situations and faced with

516
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,039
problems whose solutions are far from

517
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,120
obvious

518
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
how do i know that my alerts work why

519
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,520
didn't the ids catch that

520
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,880
what should i do when that exploit

521
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,120
doesn't work how do we handle a

522
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,880
situation technology hasn't

523
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,240
been designed to cover each of these

524
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
situations

525
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,159
it's the trade craft inherent in the

526
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:20,960
operator

527
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,600
and the team that will ultimately

528
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,640
determine

529
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,520
the success or failure of the operation

530
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,080
as you build your personal skill set as

531
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,400
you develop your organizational

532
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,440
toolkit you'll find yourself better

533
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,360
equipped to tackle the complex issues

534
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
honing your abilities and the abilities

535
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,679
of those who work with

536
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,880
and for you creates more efficiency

537
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,760
generates more effectiveness and raises

538
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,880
the overall value

539
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,240
in both yourself and your group this

540
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
does include creating a greater

541
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,559
proficiency with the toolkit

542
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,919
remember the importance of the tool

543
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,159
champion

544
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,799
now all of this takes time and on a

545
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,240
personal level

546
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,960
takes commitment

547
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
creating a skilled team or building

548
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,240
yourself into the best

549
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,000
is a costly endeavor it takes time

550
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,440
opportunity and money

551
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,640
sometimes opportunities must be created

552
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
training and technology oftentimes don't

553
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,679
come cheap in this industry

554
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,240
time is your most valuable asset and

555
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,080
there never seems to be enough of it

556
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
all of these can seem quite daunting but

557
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,840
there are some things you should ask

558
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,400
yourself

559
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,919
what have i gotten out of my previous

560
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,480
investments what will i get out of this

561
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,919
investment

562
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,520
how do i actually see returns

563
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,760
are you investing wisely you might have

564
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,280
gotten a new tool

565
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
but does it actually do anything

566
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
fundamentally different than what you

567
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
already had

568
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
it'd be great if you had someone

569
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,360
knowledgeable enough to point that out

570
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,240
before spending the money

571
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,760
the bells and whistles on that new

572
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,640
server sure are something aren't they

573
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,799
does it actually perform any better than

574
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,679
the one i already own

575
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
do you still have the expertise on your

576
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,919
team to accomplish your goals

577
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
if not you can try to get it back but

578
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,400
it's gonna take time and will prove

579
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
costly

580
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,840
did you ever develop the personal

581
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
expertise to hold your own

582
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,280
in your chosen field if the answer to

583
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,400
this is no

584
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
you do still have time it's not too late

585
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,679
you can do it you saved plenty of money

586
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,320
overall

587
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,960
by buying the software and the hardware

588
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
instead of sending people to training

589
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
conferences but was it really worth

590
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
the loss of talent that you've been

591
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
experiencing

592
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
so what reason is there to invest in

593
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
creating skilled people or building out

594
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
your own tradecraft

595
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
why not just get tools to do things

596
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,559
faster or may not even require human

597
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,400
interaction

598
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,559
technology just keeps getting better so

599
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,320
that's where we should focus

600
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,760
right i'll answer those questions with

601
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,280
question

602
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,159
is it technology or people that make the

603
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,480
tools

604
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,200
you'll find that as you invest the time

605
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
and the effort into building

606
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
the trade craft the return on investment

607
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,960
is going to come through

608
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
there's nothing like finding the one

609
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,240
piece that was needed to complete the

610
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
puzzle

611
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,840
speaking of the person who seemed to

612
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,559
know it all

613
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,080
on an intimidating level when you

614
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,840
started and being able to hold an

615
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,679
honest technical conversation without

616
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,760
getting lost or feeling like you sound

617
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,880
like an idiot

618
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,720
is super satisfying and a satisfied team

619
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,600
is a productive team

620
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,360
also considered the most revered

621
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
professionals

622
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,120
are those accomplished in their craft

623
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,440
well-developed tradecraft provides

624
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
flexibility and operations

625
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,679
that is invaluable it is the best way

626
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,559
for your analysis to be able to adapt

627
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,360
and evolve

628
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,559
in this ever-changing landscape

629
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,080
sometimes that vulnerability is not

630
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
going to have been published yet

631
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,240
there are times where the technology

632
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,320
hasn't been developed yet

633
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
but these don't need to be impassable

634
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,799
barriers to success

635
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,760
unique problems are going to require

636
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,279
unique solutions

637
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,520
and in the realm of cyber security there

638
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,960
is no shortage

639
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,480
of unique situations the greater your

640
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,600
trade craft

641
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
the more efficient and innovative your

642
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,720
solutions can be

643
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,120
the road to success is paved with

644
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,600
lessons of failure

645
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
don't give up or get discouraged just

646
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,120
because you don't get the concept right

647
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,400
away

648
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,559
don't feel that you're succeeding

649
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,000
because you can't do the job without a

650
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
particular tool

651
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,840
allow people the chance to fail forward

652
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
try looking at every challenge as a

653
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
learning opportunity

654
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,640
and teaching others to see it too a very

655
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
rough road map can be laid out something

656
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,440
like this

657
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,679
so we're going to lay down a quick idea

658
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,960
of how we might get where we

659
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,279
where we wish to go this isn't

660
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,320
groundbreaking

661
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,559
but hopefully some of you may find it

662
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,400
enlightening or inspiring

663
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
most of this is going to be approached

664
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,640
from an individual individualized

665
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
and a personalized kind of viewpoint

666
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,720
organizationally

667
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
and as a community the biggest thing

668
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,919
that we can do

669
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,320
is allow and enable this journey in

670
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,039
ourselves

671
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,520
and in our peers

672
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,000
so we have a starting point right and we

673
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
all have to start somewhere

674
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,080
somewhere is going to be reliant on

675
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
learning the operation

676
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,360
and learning what matters during this

677
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,880
phase

678
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,240
the junior analyst will be largely

679
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,919
sometimes wholly reliant upon the tools

680
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,279
this stage can be overwhelming and

681
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,440
potentially seem oppressively long

682
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,720
but we've all been there and we all make

683
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,480
it through

684
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,760
for the leaders out there remember

685
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,080
you were once in this stage yourself

686
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,039
you find yourself in this phase pay

687
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,440
attention to as many details as you can

688
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,799
soak it all in as you have personnel in

689
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,080
this stage

690
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,880
feed them those details give them the

691
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,520
wise

692
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,799
give them the house junior analysts

693
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,640
should start to learn

694
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,880
what it is the technology that you're

695
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,679
leveraging is doing

696
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,080
do your best to begin learning how it's

697
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,880
doing what it does

698
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,200
compiling and delivering reports can

699
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,799
actually be a great method of building

700
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,400
this understanding

701
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,000
it can help to highlight what it is the

702
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,240
organization and or the customers

703
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,960
actually care about it's also a great

704
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,320
opportunity to learn

705
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,360
the data that matters and also to

706
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,640
provide results

707
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,240
to compare your own endeavors too

708
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,000
no junior analyst should ever be afraid

709
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
of starting to dream up better ways

710
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
to do things the junior analyst

711
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,520
has a fresh set of eyes not marred by

712
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,240
the

713
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,520
that's how we've always done it

714
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,919
mentality

715
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,360
trying things out safely in a sandbox

716
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,399
and not on company infrastructure

717
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,600
you should be encouraged

718
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,279
so as you advance in your career you

719
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,559
find that it's

720
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,799
less about the specific software and

721
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,080
becomes more about

722
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,760
the concepts and the objectives that edr

723
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,240
definitely makes host analysis simpler

724
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,760
but you've learned how to leverage

725
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,039
powershell to do the same thing

726
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,159
with experience we all find ourselves

727
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:18,720
relying

728
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,840
less on the technology and instead

729
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,120
leveraging it to accomplish our goals

730
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,480
the tools are great alone but

731
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,279
what if you bridge their functionality

732
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,559
then they might become phenomenal

733
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,720
taking advantage of growth opportunities

734
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,399
such as training

735
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,840
conferences meetups and even mistakes

736
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,760
the hands-on experience is the

737
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,279
solidifier

738
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,360
that creates the trade craft instead of

739
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,640
just retained

740
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,919
knowledge this

741
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,360
is this progression is where operators

742
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,520
truly start to learn how to apply

743
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,840
as analysts advancing their career

744
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,760
you they'll find that it's less about

745
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,279
the specific sorry

746
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,200
i got completely

747
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,039
backed up there so anyways all the

748
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,240
solutions

749
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,840
that have been dreamt up as a junior

750
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,520
analyst

751
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,840
how do they start to get implemented

752
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,080
so i know it says made it and eventually

753
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,159
you'll be able not only to see what

754
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,679
needs done

755
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,840
but how to do it and what to use to best

756
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,559
succeed

757
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,279
but how do you know you've succeeded how

758
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,840
do you know you've made it

759
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,120
you may never feel that way we exist in

760
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,000
a space that is

761
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,240
filled with imposter syndrome because so

762
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,120
many of us know

763
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,840
that there is so much that we don't know

764
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,399
we can't

765
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,080
worry about that you know so much more

766
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,600
than you're giving yourself credit for

767
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,200
organizationally success is incredibly

768
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,799
subjective

769
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,360
personally it's still incredibly

770
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,480
subjective

771
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,919
but might be slightly easier to

772
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,559
generalize

773
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,640
i can't lay out what success is to

774
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,399
everyone

775
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,600
but this proposed roadmap

776
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,720
does have some expectations of those

777
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,520
who've reached the goal

778
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,279
providing technical insights into higher

779
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,880
level decision making

780
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
of whatever organization you're a part

781
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,080
of is vital to the continued success

782
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,120
of your operations

783
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,640
start presenting to your peers even if

784
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,720
it's just over beers to a few

785
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,880
to a few friends or colleagues and you

786
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,000
never present to a local

787
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
group or ever at a conference share your

788
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,640
experiences with others

789
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,000
help the community move forward

790
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
this road stretches further into the

791
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,559
horizon than we can possibly see

792
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,880
so it requires the continued development

793
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,480
of its travelers

794
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,640
the next generation of skill has to come

795
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,159
from somewhere

796
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,720
you may not be teaching their classes

797
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,200
but you

798
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,799
should be training them to fill your

799
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,320
shoes when you are inevitably gone

800
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,640
being able to take security concepts and

801
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,440
apply them in a real world situation

802
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,960
is the greatest skill that you can

803
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,600
develop and the greatest asset that you

804
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,480
can bring to the table

805
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,559
and so what's the tldr you need the

806
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,440
tools

807
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,600
need to know what they do and need to

808
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
know how they do what they do

809
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,559
stop blaming the tools ignoring the

810
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,679
training

811
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,919
stop blaming the training ignoring the

812
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,519
tools

813
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,919
you need to invest in yourself you need

814
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,240
to invest in your people

815
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,840
and never forget the most important

816
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,480
asset is you

817
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,679
thank you for your time and if there are

818
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:15,840
any questions

819
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,360
all right i guess sounded crickets means

820
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
all good in the room

821
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,960
so um yeah

822
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,080
uh contact information on screen and

823
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,440
for any questions shooting my way i will

824
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
make my slides available to the b-sides

825
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:45,840
team

826
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,960
however they want that to happen and

827
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,720
thank you very much everyone i greatly

828
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,840
appreciate it

829
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,320
thank you logan we really appreciate it

830
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,080
uh i'm not seeing any questions in the

831
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,960
uh in the go to webinar chat if there

832
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,159
are any other

833
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,519
uh questions feel free to post them in

834
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,440
the discord or you can ask them here

835
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,799
oh seems good all right

836
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,240
well thank you wally we really

837
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,399
appreciate your your talk is very

838
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,279
informative

839
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,960
and definitely indicative of of what i

840
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,360
see

841
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,120
you know in my day-to-day work as well

842
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
that's what

843
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,360
sounded very very similar to our to my

844
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,918
situation

845
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
uh well thank you very much yeah um

846
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
i think regardless of what section of

847
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,880
this we fall into whether it be public

848
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,000
private

849
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,960
red blue however you want to look at it

850
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,239
we all kind of stare down the same

851
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,119
things going along right

852
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,800
so at the end of the day

853
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,839
we're the ones who get to make the

854
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,040
difference

855
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,679
this is true
