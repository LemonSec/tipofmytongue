1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,080
well thank you for the introduction um

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,960
yeah i am uh aaron rubesh my

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
presentation was going to be all over um

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,639
i just kind of threw the name out there

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,480
i figured it fit with what i'm going to

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,240
present to you guys um

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,839
i knew i didn't know what i was doing

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,960
but now you do and so the gist of that

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,680
is basically i learned security the hard

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,080
way

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,080
i got into it um

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,199
when i was younger uh unknowingly

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,640
really and i just started

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
you know going through online resources

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,399
and

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
going through the the fire hose like

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,079
like was mentioned in the previous

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:40,640
prison

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
presentation and really trying to learn

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,200
everything on my own and there is a lot

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,600
of information that comes from that

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
and so i i told myself if i could ever

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,280
help

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,199
anyone else learn security i hope that

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,559
they don't have to

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,079
go through the massive amounts of

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,960
information like i had to just to get to

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
where they want to go and i and i hope

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,559
that this this presentation

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,920
really helps to clear up kind of

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
what it is that you should know getting

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,200
into security

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
what are some what are some uh i guess

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,360
technical

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,880
goals that you should try to achieve

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
um going into your first job or

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
or going into school or just just

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,520
setting for yourself if you just want to

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,880
do it as a hobby you know what are what

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
are some of those technical goals

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
that you should kind of prepare for um

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
when you're really trying to get into

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,240
this stuff because it is a lot

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,400
there's a lot of different tracks in

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,159
security there's a lot of information to

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,200
go through

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
and it can be overwhelming to someone

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,119
and i i truly believe that if you have

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,880
any type of knack for technology you can

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,240
do well in cyber security

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,079
um but the thing that scares a lot of

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,759
people is just the sheer amount of

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,880
information

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
um in the stuff that i guess a lot of

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,079
people expect you to know

56
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,960
if you look at any job applications and

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,840
stuff out there you see

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
all of these crazy requirements for

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,880
everything and it's

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,399
that scares a lot of people off when

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
when really you you can get by with

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,360
with a lot less than what's uh than

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,080
what's required

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
so i hope i hope this presentation

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,879
really serves as a is a good starting

66
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,239
point for for someone

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,640
getting new into security that wants to

68
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
make this their career

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,920
um and if you if you've been in it for a

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
while maybe maybe it'll serve as a

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
refresher

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
maybe it will kind of um

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,800
remind you of some of those skills that

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
you kind of put to the side and you

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
didn't pick up on that that you should

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,239
get back into

77
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
so a little bit about me

78
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,120
so currently i am a software developer i

79
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,680
am not

80
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,239
in a security role per se but i

81
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:40,959
previously

82
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
was a penetration tester and i worked on

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,400
an application security team

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
i live in houston and

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,920
um so i guess one of the questions might

86
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
be is why is this guy talking to me

87
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,800
about security if he bailed from

88
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,920
security um

89
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
i didn't bail out of security i

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
whenever i learned security i also

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
learned programming at the same time i

92
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
taught myself both skills

93
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,720
and i i feel like they they really go

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
hand-in-hand because you wouldn't have

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,319
the insecure software if you didn't have

96
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,840
uh or you wouldn't have the security

97
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,040
vulnerability if you didn't have

98
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
secure software um people are a portion

99
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,080
of that but

100
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,120
you get the drift um in my in my roles

101
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,680
as a

102
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,200
uh as a corporate penetration tester

103
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
one of the things i noticed um was that

104
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
the tools really suck

105
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,239
uh well i hated the tools i hated using

106
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,760
the tools and um

107
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
i always thought that that's that's some

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
place that could be improved greatly so

109
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,480
i looked for a

110
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
company that was doing security tool

111
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
development

112
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,799
um and i joined them and now i'm

113
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,760
helping build uh security tools so still

114
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,120
kind of in security but

115
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,599
more of a software dev now i started off

116
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,480
with security

117
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,239
really before i really knew what i was

118
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,480
doing um i used to play a lot of video

119
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,519
games like like mo

120
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,640
like most kids um and i

121
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,599
really wanted to be better than others

122
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,959
at those games but i didn't want to put

123
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,519
in the work

124
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,000
so i started developing automation tools

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,319
um cheats hacks exploits

126
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
i started making brute forcers for some

127
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
of the games i played to break into

128
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,480
other people's accounts do all the stuff

129
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
that they uh that they worked hard for

130
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
um yeah sorry if that ever happened to

131
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
you i don't do that stuff anymore

132
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,800
um but to do that i had to learn

133
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
basically reverse engineering how to

134
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,960
um how to debug an application that i

135
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
didn't have source code

136
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
for read different variables inside the

137
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,759
memory

138
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
uh and then call different things um

139
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
that i wanted to do or that i wanted to

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,440
automate

141
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,800
and for brute forcing it's same thing as

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,520
you know

143
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,800
um john the ripper does or

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
other other password crackers and stuff

145
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
out there um but just developing that

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,840
from scratch not really knowing that

147
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,639
that's

148
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,320
you know kind of involved in security it

149
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,759
wasn't until later on when i started

150
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,840
college that i actually

151
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
saw those skills that i was using and

152
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,080
said hey this is actually a pretty

153
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,639
decent

154
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
um pretty decent career avenue

155
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,680
and so i i jumped on that train and

156
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
i got a degree in uh computer

157
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
information systems and i focused on

158
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,520
security as like a hobby and

159
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,680
all the tool sets and stuff on the side

160
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
and that's where i got to where i am

161
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,039
today

162
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,280
so um yeah so

163
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
i basically just want to get into like

164
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
the skills that i see that are valuable

165
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,479
for someone getting into security

166
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,039
that i really in my experience my my

167
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,400
couple years of experience

168
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
that i see like my peers

169
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,880
insecurity lacking

170
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
it's pretty crazy that um that a lot of

171
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
people in

172
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
in this field now and i know there's a

173
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,759
there's a lack of talent

174
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,919
um but there's a lot of people who who

175
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,440
don't have some of these basic skills

176
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,919
and it's

177
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,319
it's it's sometimes not a tool issue

178
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,039
it's sometimes

179
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,199
just a lack of the fundamental knowledge

180
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,280
um

181
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
and it will lead you to less you know

182
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,560
false positives and then better reports

183
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,000
and stuff like that so

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
uh the biggest thing that i always tell

185
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,039
people

186
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,319
to learn when you want to get into

187
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,120
security is networking

188
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
what is a packet how does it traverse a

189
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,400
network

190
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
how does a switch switch the switch the

191
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,400
packet to

192
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
you know whatever devices how does it

193
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
how does a router work how does a

194
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
firewall work

195
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
um just basic like network plus

196
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
ccna level networking knowledge

197
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,039
um it's it's really crucial in this

198
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,000
field um you have so many

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
so many exploits and stuff that happen

200
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
remotely now or the all the good ones

201
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,160
anyway or ones that you can

202
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
basically use from a remote perspective

203
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,080
that you can

204
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,680
use to get into something that you don't

205
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
have physical access to

206
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
and to do that you need to know how

207
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
how you know those devices are

208
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
communicating on a network level

209
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,560
what uh what type of protocols are being

210
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,199
sent

211
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
um what that looks like whenever you

212
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,240
whenever you take a

213
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,319
uh packet sniffer like wireshark tcp

214
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,080
dump something like that

215
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
and you export the the pcap and you

216
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,400
and you're reading it you know what is

217
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
that what does that information mean

218
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
and then how can you edit that

219
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
information to get it to do with do what

220
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,960
you want

221
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
you take some of the some of the network

222
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,400
level exploits out there right now

223
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,000
um that are just you know uh basically

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,479
at the protocol level you know editing

225
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,759
different fields in

226
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,520
a specific protocol that's going to make

227
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
something some device on the other end

228
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
communicate ineffectively or cause an

229
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,400
exploit

230
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
and you you learn how to build that

231
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,080
stuff yourself

232
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,800
so really you know how to read a pcap is

233
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,440
crucial

234
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,479
what the network devices do and then how

235
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,240
do they do them

236
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
how does the operating system do

237
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
networking

238
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,120
how does your linux machine route

239
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,479
packets how does it

240
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,240
assign ip addresses to different

241
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
interfaces

242
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,000
how does uh how does the iptables

243
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
firewall work

244
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,160
um if you've used something like pfsense

245
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
before how does that stuff how does the

246
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,919
packet filter and bsd work

247
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,879
um and really the best way to learn this

248
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,000
stuff is to

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
you know try to build your own router

250
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,599
you can do that with just a uh

251
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,639
you could set up a linux virtual machine

252
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,080
set up a couple other virtual machines

253
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,680
with it and you can build your own

254
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,280
network turn on ip forwarding

255
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
and there are some iptable rules in

256
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,599
there and you can actually

257
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,320
have a functional router that you built

258
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,039
yourself and

259
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,679
without really needing something else

260
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,040
really getting into the stuff

261
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,800
and actually playing around with it

262
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
you're going to learn a lot

263
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,399
and it's going to make you a better

264
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,040
a better penetration test or better uh

265
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,560
blue team if you if that's what you want

266
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
to go into about a purple team

267
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
player um it's really going to

268
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
really going to make you stand out more

269
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,959
when you when you're able to analyze

270
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,240
this information

271
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,640
and and really know what's going on

272
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,959
the uh second second skill set is is

273
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
operating systems

274
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
um really you need to learn how to

275
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
effectively use windows linux

276
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
and mac um i used to just

277
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,880
completely bash on windows wherever it

278
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,640
uh wherever i saw it

279
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,080
um i never i never liked using it i

280
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,640
hey i just hated it but really once you

281
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
once you really get into it you know

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
windows is everywhere

283
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
and it's something that you need to

284
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,959
learn how to use effectively you need to

285
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,640
learn how to do the things that you want

286
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,920
to do

287
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,480
in windows because you're not going to

288
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,440
escape it

289
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
and you really

290
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,839
need to turn that into something that

291
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,560
you could take advantage of

292
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,320
so by doing that you know

293
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,760
you can more effectively discover

294
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
exploits on your own you can more

295
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
effectively execute

296
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,160
exploits um and execute uh

297
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,480
different penetration tests and um

298
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
assessments and stuff like that

299
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,519
so uh along with those skill sets you

300
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,120
want to learn how to like troubleshoot

301
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,959
and inspect the operating systems you're

302
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,480
working on so

303
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,160
just figuring out okay what type of

304
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
processes are running on this machine

305
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
what type of services are running on

306
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,760
this machine

307
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
um what type of uh what type of

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
applications are listening on different

309
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
ports you know when you when you

310
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
when you run like an nmap scan on a

311
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,600
a networked device you're used to just

312
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,399
you know

313
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,560
tossing a couple flags into an nmap

314
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,800
into nmap and then running it on a

315
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,240
running it against the machine and then

316
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,600
seeing what

317
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
what ports are open what what it thinks

318
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,720
is there right but how do you do that

319
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,120
from

320
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,800
from the inside right if you're already

321
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,399
on the machine you want to see hey maybe

322
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,480
something's listening on something that

323
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,680
i didn't pick up from externally

324
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
what what may be listening here that i

325
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,680
can that i can find that i can maybe

326
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,800
take advantage of um how do you find

327
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
what tools are available maybe

328
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
you are on a machine and you're trying

329
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,200
to find a way to pivot somewhere else

330
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
how do you do that without knowing

331
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,320
what's available to you on the machine

332
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,079
you're working on

333
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,880
maybe you have a c compiler installed

334
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,040
maybe you only have bash available maybe

335
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,200
you have python installed

336
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,160
what can you utilize to help get you to

337
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
the next machine that you actually want

338
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,000
to get

339
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
to um

340
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
and that's really the only

341
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
there's multiple ways to learn this

342
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,920
stuff

343
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
you can go for like an a-plus or

344
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,959
something like that or read through

345
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
those books but really

346
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,959
it's going to require you to just

347
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
install some virtual machines

348
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
or solid on physical hardware if you

349
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,240
want and just

350
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,839
get into it and just start playing

351
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,440
around with the stuff and really

352
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
and really learning how all of the stuff

353
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,560
works you know

354
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,040
set a goal for yourself say hey i want

355
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
to set up a vulnerable

356
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
web server and you learn how to

357
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,040
create a web server or on linux or maybe

358
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
windows and you host a vulnerable one or

359
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,639
maybe you um

360
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
add some like known exploit exploitable

361
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
configurations of that stuff and

362
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
you set that stuff up on your own um to

363
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
to figure out really how how the whole

364
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,959
process of uh

365
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
how that works um

366
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
third skill that uh that i see really um

367
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,519
a lot of people lacking is just a

368
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
general programming sense of programming

369
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,120
knowledge a lot of people want to come

370
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,399
to security that they

371
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,160
and they don't really want want to

372
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
program that much they want to run some

373
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,959
tools

374
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,760
run some

375
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,519
they want to run some scripts and just

376
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
analyze some output and that's fine

377
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
um if you want to do that but if you but

378
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
i feel like if you really want to

379
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
want to learn you know what you're doing

380
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
learning some programming is

381
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
is going to be crucial to that i always

382
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:58,959
say learn c

383
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,959
and then learn something like ruby or

384
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,320
python

385
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,760
and that's because everything's built on

386
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
top of c

387
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
operating system kernels are built on c

388
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,519
most of your tools on linux are built in

389
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,600
c most your tools on windows are

390
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
probably built in dot net now but a lot

391
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
of them were built in c

392
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
um and really everything you want to do

393
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,360
on an operating system on any operating

394
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
system you can interface it through c

395
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,240
if you want to build a packet sniffer

396
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
you want to create your own packets to

397
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,079
send across the network you can do that

398
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,160
and see yeah you can yeah there's python

399
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,680
libraries and stuff available for that

400
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,320
as well

401
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
but you have everything available to you

402
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
already

403
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,079
if you're using c um

404
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,000
by doing that you know you gain a you

405
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
gain a deeper understanding of how

406
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
you know other applications on the

407
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
operating system are actually using

408
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,959
those libraries as well

409
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,880
whenever you whenever you kind of learn

410
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
the low-level programming the system

411
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,760
level programming like that

412
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,279
and you understand kind of the linux

413
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,639
apis and the windows apis

414
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,800
you understand that how how other

415
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
applications out there

416
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,199
are always going to be using the same

417
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,320
function calls that um that you would be

418
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
using if if you wanted to write a

419
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:12,800
program that did

420
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
something similar right and you can use

421
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,639
that to your advantage you know that an

422
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,120
application that's communicating

423
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,639
to the internet or to some other

424
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,079
networked device is going to have to

425
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,000
create a socket it's going to have to

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,959
then send bytes across that so by

427
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,600
knowing that

428
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
you can you can understand that um

429
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,279
that if you go in and you actually look

430
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,880
for where it's calling those functions

431
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,760
you can actually see

432
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
okay hey this is what data it's sending

433
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
this is how it's sending data

434
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,320
maybe if i can intercept that or rewrite

435
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,199
what it's uh

436
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,560
rewrite it what it's sending i could

437
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
discover a new exploit or i can

438
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
um i can figure out another way uh

439
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,440
to get it to do what i want um it's

440
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
things like that that you that you start

441
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,639
to understand that

442
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,760
that software is really um it really is

443
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,079
what

444
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,440
what you make it to be and even if

445
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,320
someone else made it you can still

446
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,160
do what you want with it if it's on your

447
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,519
machine

448
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,360
and this is uh this this leads to a more

449
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,160
easily tran

450
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,880
more easy transition into like reverse

451
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,399
engineering if that's what you want to

452
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,519
do

453
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,600
um preferably that's that's the stuff i

454
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,320
enjoy uh debugging applications finding

455
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,760
my own exploits um

456
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
and doing stuff like that is is kind of

457
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:26,880
what

458
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,639
what i'm mostly interested in and that's

459
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
that's where i think uh

460
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,240
you know the low-level programming stuff

461
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
really helps that because you're

462
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
actually able to analyze

463
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
what those uh what those functions are

464
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,480
what they're doing in that application

465
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,199
physical networking and not like you

466
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
know just cabling up stuff but actually

467
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,759
growing your community

468
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,920
whenever you have a stronger community

469
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,839
and a larger community of people who you

470
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,360
can reach out to

471
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,720
you're going to just you're going to

472
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,040
have a better baseline of knowledge to

473
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,720
begin with because you have

474
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
people who you can more easily ask

475
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,040
questions to that can tell you

476
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,959
either yes you're doing this the right

477
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
way or yes you're doing this wrong way

478
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:08,720
or

479
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
you're looking at this the wrong way um

480
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,639
they can help you

481
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,519
uh get out of the weeds with a uh uh

482
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,199
with an issue that you may be

483
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,399
you know uh wrapped around into too much

484
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,560
that's not really going to um

485
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
to get you anywhere faster than you

486
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
would have done it on your own

487
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,079
um i like to say it's it's good job

488
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,759
security um

489
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,160
and not in a sense that hey you're going

490
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
to stay at your current job for

491
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
for a for a good long time but it's

492
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,160
better job security and knowing that

493
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,440
you have people looking out for you

494
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,839
i can't almost i mean it's got to be

495
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,800
every day you know

496
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,759
you see on twitter in security twitter

497
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,160
anyway

498
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,199
that um you know someone's saying hey i

499
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,040
lost my job here's a resume and then you

500
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,240
see you know

501
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
30 minutes to an hour later people

502
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,399
helping them out and having

503
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,279
four to five job offers in a day i mean

504
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,199
stuff like that that's really

505
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,280
that that you get from having a good

506
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,880
community that you don't get otherwise

507
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
and i learned this you know in the past

508
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
couple years a lot better than i did

509
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,679
before because i was always kind of the

510
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,280
guy that wanted to take everything solo

511
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,000
i always wanted

512
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,599
to figure it out on my own and really

513
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,079
try and just do it do it myself i always

514
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,679
wanted to figure it out my own

515
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,119
and never and never really take help

516
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
from others and

517
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,440
i've had to i've had to struggle against

518
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
you know thinking that way and get out

519
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
of that mindset and really embrace

520
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,880
um having a larger community and um

521
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,720
really communicating better with others

522
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,160
and contributing back

523
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,200
to communities invest in the education

524
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,320
of others you know

525
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,080
don't just if you see someone asking for

526
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,000
um for help with someone or they or

527
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
someone wants um

528
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
want some assistance doing something

529
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,600
don't don't think that it's oh that's uh

530
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
that's too easy for for me to really

531
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,039
care about someone else will help them

532
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,760
you know

533
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
or maybe maybe you're afraid of being

534
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,039
wrong

535
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,799
when you're trying to help someone um

536
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,480
or you see someone just struggling with

537
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
a with a certain topic

538
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,160
that you know a little bit more about um

539
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,880
you know just

540
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
take five ten minutes out of your day to

541
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,559
just help someone out

542
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,480
help help at least lead them to the

543
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,799
right path um and not just

544
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,000
and not just ignore it it's gonna make

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
you feel a little better about yourself

546
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,000
and it's gonna help

547
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
the community um as a whole um

548
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
because we're all we're all a community

549
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,720
we're all

550
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,000
we're all in this together we're not

551
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
we're not fighting against each other or

552
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,919
anything

553
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,840
um you know the more the more people we

554
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
have investing back into

555
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,000
into the education of others the better

556
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
and more uh

557
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
more knowledgeable our community will be

558
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,240
as a whole

559
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,960
um radiating on what was said in the in

560
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
the previous uh presentation as well you

561
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,520
know attend

562
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,039
ten more conferences attend the local

563
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,200
ones if you have uh b-sides locally

564
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,360
um unfortunately the houston one isn't

565
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,520
that great i don't think

566
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,640
um but uh

567
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
but you know attend attend on a couple

568
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
uh you know a couple cities away you

569
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
know fly out of state and go to a

570
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,080
different

571
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,440
uh go to different conference um go to

572
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,799
go to some of the larger ones go to

573
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,080
small ones

574
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,799
um you know just just find other find

575
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
find ways to go out and meet some people

576
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,679
you never know who

577
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,280
you're gonna meet and uh and what type

578
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,559
of knowledge they're gonna have and what

579
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,160
what type of uh what type of

580
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,360
opportunities that it might present you

581
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,960
um another school skill set i like to uh

582
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,799
i like to add in here is don't just

583
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,080
learn a tool

584
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,760
learn how to learn how it works don't

585
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,320
just you know get on a windows machine

586
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,960
and run

587
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,720
mimi cast whatever you want to do to try

588
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
and get some passwords right

589
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,320
learn how that tool is actually doing

590
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,600
what it's doing

591
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,720
um because chances are that whenever a

592
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,799
tool like that gets fixed

593
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,039
there's going to be some code changes

594
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,400
around where that

595
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,640
where that tool is hitting and if you

596
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
know that code is changing in a certain

597
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
area you can also use that to your

598
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,960
advantage of finding

599
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
ways to get around what was changed and

600
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,080
by knowing what

601
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
what kind of type of areas of an

602
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
application you're already targeting

603
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,080
uh it kind of reduces the time it's

604
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,880
going to take for

605
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,120
for like a new x-ray to come to come

606
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,600
about or a new way of uh

607
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,640
or a new way of um of executing and

608
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,080
getting the same functionality

609
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,440
is gonna it's gonna come about so um

610
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,840
you're going to uh you're also going to

611
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,280
discover a lot more ways

612
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,640
of of doing the same thing

613
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,360
um i like to say you know uh

614
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,159
whenever i wanted to get into like wi-fi

615
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:42,799
hiking and

616
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,880
man in the middling right um everyone

617
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,559
just says okay go go buy like the

618
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,320
pineapple right but

619
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
you don't really need that you can do

620
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,240
that with just a raspberry pi and a

621
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,559
uh a wi-fi adapter you can do

622
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,240
all of that you're on your own just by

623
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,840
learning how the tools actually work

624
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,679
um and making you know a more reliable

625
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,880
product or making something that you

626
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
know you can rely on your own for

627
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
instead of having to rely on a specific

628
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,280
piece of software hardware

629
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,039
it will also allow you to um to

630
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,720
contribute back to other tools

631
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
so maybe there is a tool that that's

632
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
really popular that you like using or

633
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
one that's just you know that's not very

634
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,200
popular that's uh

635
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,520
that you like you lose using and you

636
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
want to

637
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,159
help them out and you want to contribute

638
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,600
something that you found

639
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
with it you know you can contribute back

640
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,159
to that tool and make it better which is

641
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,200
going to then

642
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,640
go back to making our community a more

643
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,919
knowledgeable

644
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,039
more knowledgeable community

645
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,799
so a lot of uh a lot of people al also

646
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,360
ask me

647
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,799
you know how do you get all the hands-on

648
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,280
experience um how do you go

649
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
get the first job that's you know saying

650
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,039
hey i want you to have

651
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,200
uh you know five years of splunk

652
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
experience and um

653
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
and uh you know knowledge of firewall

654
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
systems and um

655
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,960
and different ids ips's and how to write

656
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,000
you know the most

657
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
intense uh snort filters and stuff like

658
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,520
that so um you really

659
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,039
it it sucks that that employers would

660
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,919
ask

661
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,559
a newcomer um to have such experience

662
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,159
but that's really unfortunately the

663
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,360
the place we're in right now um

664
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,799
and really i'm not saying you don't

665
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,480
stand a chance if you don't

666
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
try to create that hands-on experience

667
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
yourself um but it will make

668
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,159
it more likely that you'll you'll get an

669
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,760
opportunity from someone like that

670
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
and there are some great there are some

671
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
great employers out there that actually

672
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
invest in your education

673
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,960
and um and

674
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,240
don't care that if you that you know

675
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
everything off the start

676
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,159
but there's also a lot of crappy ones

677
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,360
out there that

678
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,919
are going to want you to have that and

679
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,799
it just

680
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,840
in my opinion um if you're not kind of

681
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
the person that's that's

682
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
that's going to rely on just the

683
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
employer being a good person

684
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,799
um really you know it doesn't hurt to go

685
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,159
out and create your own hands-on

686
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,360
experience and in fact it's going to

687
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,840
make you

688
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,480
a better more knowledgeable security

689
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,159
expert

690
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
by doing so so i always tell i always

691
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:24,720
tell people

692
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,320
you know build out a build out a

693
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,400
full-scale vm network like act like you

694
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
have a production environment

695
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
that has a you know a database server a

696
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,320
web server a couple application servers

697
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,640
maybe an email server

698
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
you can build that all out in vms now on

699
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,720
moderate hardware

700
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
and just try to just try to just try to

701
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,919
attack it and see

702
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,960
see what you can find see what you learn

703
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
in the process of just setting all that

704
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,919
up it's going to make you it's going to

705
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,039
make you a lot better just

706
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,480
just by going through that process

707
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,440
launch attacks on networks that

708
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,960
launch attacks on like your built out

709
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
networks anyway

710
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,080
that really allow you to not not have to

711
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,200
just hit

712
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
a vulnerable machine so maybe you were

713
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
used to doing like ctfs like hack the

714
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,400
box or

715
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,039
doing uh the vulnerable vulnerable

716
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,799
machines or something like that

717
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,840
and you are used to just spinning that

718
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,559
stuff up

719
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,000
and launching an attack at it and just

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,679
going crazy

721
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,039
maybe try putting a firewall or

722
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,039
something in between that or maybe try

723
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,320
putting an ids between that so that

724
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
whenever you're trying to attack those

725
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
things you're not

726
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
just going straight for the vulnerable

727
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,919
machine you're trying to get past

728
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,039
other obstacles along the way

729
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,840
um and the reason i say that is because

730
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
99

731
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
of the time it's never going to be as

732
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,000
easy it is

733
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,520
is in a ctf um or

734
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,159
or any of the other challenges out there

735
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,240
like that

736
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
there's always going to be some type of

737
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,000
security control well not always there

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,480
are some

739
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
places that don't have it but it more

740
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,559
just expect there to always be

741
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,240
some type of security controls in the

742
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,159
way blocking your

743
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,679
blocking you from doing you know the

744
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
exploits you want a lot of people come

745
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
in here thinking

746
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
you know i all i have to do is run these

747
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
these couple scripts

748
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,279
um i'm going to then be able to

749
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,039
uh be able to you know exfil some

750
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,400
passwords and then

751
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,679
and then i'm going to be able to pivot

752
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,039
on to the next one and you're not

753
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,240
because you're going to have

754
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,799
an entire army of devices actually

755
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
blocking you from doing

756
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,600
what you expect and that that throws a

757
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,559
lot of people off

758
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,240
um because they're not used to dealing

759
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,159
with that so actually spin that stuff

760
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,840
up you're on your own and practice it

761
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,039
and then you know

762
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,880
a great way to test if you know how to

763
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
harden systems and harden

764
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,520
your networks uh something that i did a

765
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,679
couple times

766
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,720
throw out like a a open

767
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,279
ftp server on the internet and just you

768
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,720
know see what hits it see how long it

769
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,320
takes for malware to get dropped on it

770
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,480
um then try to add like some security

771
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,679
controls to that

772
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,200
and see if you can harden it further and

773
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,600
keep prevent that stuff from hitting it

774
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,400
do the same for like a web server have

775
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,279
some

776
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,679
you know database set up and just

777
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,159
putting it on the internet

778
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,799
is a surefire way of having someone

779
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,240
scanning you and someone trying to hit

780
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,000
you within

781
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,480
probably 20 minutes um i think it's the

782
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,600
longest i've gone

783
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,760
of putting something online and not

784
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,960
having anyone hit it yet is probably

785
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,559
about 20 minutes so

786
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,080
um do it in uh find a find a cheap cloud

787
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
hosting provider and you know spin up a

788
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,720
five dollar

789
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,080
droplet somewhere and spin up a server

790
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,440
and just see how long you can go

791
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,720
with uh uh without getting hit or

792
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
um and trying to make improvements to

793
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,080
that and try to

794
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,840
prevent that from happening so

795
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,000
you
