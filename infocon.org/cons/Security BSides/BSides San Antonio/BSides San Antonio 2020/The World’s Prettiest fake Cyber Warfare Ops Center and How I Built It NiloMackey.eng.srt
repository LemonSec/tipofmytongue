3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,759
warfare op center

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,760
and how i built it uh i just want to

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,880
start off by

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,719
saying a big thanks to b-sides and the

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,400
many sponsors of this event

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,079
uh because i'm really excited to give

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,760
this talk and

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,279
the op it's just a really awesome

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,960
opportunity to present and share

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
what i think is a really cool project so

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,320
big thanks to b-sides and our sponsors

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
so who am i i'm nilo mackey uh i'm a 15

at isa at lee high school um

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,200
i'm a massive nerd a tech enthusiast all

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,480
of that

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,719
uh ever since i've been a little kid

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,760
i've been

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
you know just trying to learn and do as

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
much as i can with technology

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,280
from programming to building robotics

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,680
and

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
all sorts of different things my recent

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,480
interests have recently shifted a little

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
more towards cyber security

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,760
and it's just a really cool field that i

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,000
uh want to pursue in a career

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so at the bottom you can see my contact

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,119
information if you all want to

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,720
screenshot that so you can

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
uh get back to me at a later date i'm

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
also in the discord my username is fleto

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,280
that's what my logo in the bottom right

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,520
hand is it's been my username

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,479
or my nickname for a very long time

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,920
so what's this talk all about

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,119
it's a talk about a massive

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,240
15-foot video wall and everything about

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,360
design planning uh how we built it what

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
we were trying to achieve with it

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
it's an educational project so it

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
largely serves uh

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
in an educational capacity displaying

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,000
information

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,280
at a museum about the artifacts and

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
also about cyber security and cyber

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,280
warfare

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,759
so i will let ksat take it from here

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,759
they ran a very great news story with

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
just a couple corrections that i'll have

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,079
to make

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,199
when the video is over but here you go

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,719
for san antonio is the alamo city's

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,720
technology campus more than 13 000

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
people on property generating over

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
5 billion but port essay is so much more

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
than just a place of work it's a place

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
of innovation and education

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,120
max massey visited the san antonio

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,959
museum of science and technology to get

63
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,480
a first-hand look at the new

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
cyber security simulator hey guys we are

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
here at sam's at the museum at fort sa

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,360
and i'm looking at something very cool

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,920
the first

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
personal computer designed right here in

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
san antonio in 1970 and we are joined

70
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
by dave monroe of the museum so david

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
what exactly are we looking at right now

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,959
why is this so important this is the

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,519
first desktop computer that was ever

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,519
built but prior to this time computers

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,959
either filled big rooms

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,120
maintained computers or they were many

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
computers and racks

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,519
but this incorporated all of the uh

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,920
technology the processor screen keyboard

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,519
in one package that would sit on your

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
desk so from going from the past

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,480
to going to the present right here this

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:02,800
is

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
amazing to see what are these four

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
75-inch screens and you were telling me

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
it's called the sock

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,239
yes special operations center this is

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,519
our simulated

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,000
cyber special operations center and what

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
we're doing here is showing the public

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
what what threats are to the networks uh

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,840
what

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,239
what the reactions or the effects of

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,840
hacking into the networks

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
uh can cause on daily life it can cause

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,400
problems in your bank accounts your

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
electric power

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,239
or your refrigerator so what we're

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,120
looking at right there

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
to see local time but you also see

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
things going from country to country

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,680
fire eye cyber threat can you explain

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
this is real popular

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,840
correct this is real data these are

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
attacks that are being

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,840
levied against different networks in

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
different countries

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
there are different kinds of attacks so

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,159
they're color-coded based on the

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,120
type of attack that they're you know why

111
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
is this important why should people

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,799
care about this several reasons well

113
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,280
again one one is you need to be aware of

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,040
the threats that these hackers and these

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
cyber attacks can have on you and your

116
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,239
personal life

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,519
so you need to protect your own

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
computers your own networks your own

119
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,280
appliances in your home

120
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,959
secondly there are national level

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,358
threats that can threaten our national

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
infrastructure and dod and we should

123
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,880
appreciate those threats

124
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
and that our governments are working to

125
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
protect us in those areas

126
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
clearing and thirdly there are a lot of

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
jobs in the area in cyber security

128
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
and a lot of those are in san antonio

129
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,840
and we like to

130
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
introduce those opportunities to

131
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
children and young adults

132
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,199
so they can study it and become involved

133
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,720
in these shops

134
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
david all right thank you so much for

135
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
having a good time thank you

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,280
all right guys this is just one of the

137
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,520
many stories we're doing here at port sa

138
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,320
throughout the week

139
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,479
back to you all right so i hope that was

140
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,800
a decent enough intro just a couple

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,520
corrections

142
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
i wanted to clarify uh david monroe

143
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,800
who's the founder

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,400
of our museum which is san antonio

145
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,479
museum for science and technology

146
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,160
is he did a lot more than invent the

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
cell phone camera he's invented

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
everything from

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,759
piano keyboards all the way to those two

150
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
uh data point uh terminals and computers

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,560
that you saw

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
in the beginning uh also they are 82

153
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
inch tvs and not 75 inch tvs

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,759
and so the total horizontal height

155
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
or sorry horizontal size of the screen

156
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
is actually more about 15 feet

157
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
so the video doesn't quite do it justice

158
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,919
but it is

159
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
massive who's this talk men for

160
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,160
anyone uh you know whoever you are

161
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
regardless if you're a professional

162
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
who's been working uh in education

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
or uh cyber security for a very long

164
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,360
time

165
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
or you're a lay person who's just

166
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
stopping by

167
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,000
you can take something away from this

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,800
talk and i think that everybody can

169
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,840
at least learn one or two things

170
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,720
so how did all this happen long story

171
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,199
short

172
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,800
uh for about the past three years i've

173
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,720
been working with samsat

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,680
and more recently ieee which is uh the

175
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,520
institute of electrical and electronics

176
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,560
engineers

177
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
uh on all sorts of different kinds of

178
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
projects most of them

179
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,600
involving electronics uh and

180
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
this really this entire project was kind

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
of the fruit of this collaboration so it

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,919
wouldn't have happened if we hadn't

183
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,680
had uh ieee and samsat working together

184
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
uh just kind of wanted to talk about

185
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
some of the images on the top right

186
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,840
these are all images of the museum space

187
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,759
uh we have a really cool space it's in a

188
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,520
decommissioned chapel we are

189
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,000
where kelly air force base used to be uh

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,560
it is now

191
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
port san antonio uh on the top right you

192
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
can see some of our

193
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,240
really awesome tesla coils uh the

194
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
center right you can see are now

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,199
uh removed exhibit on data point and

196
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,840
uh retro computing technology which has

197
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
now been replaced

198
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
for the most part by the video wall and

199
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,720
in the bottom right

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,919
you can see a close-up of some

201
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,120
tube based memory which is

202
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,039
yet again in our computational

203
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,560
technology exhibit that is

204
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
for the most part no longer there um

205
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
more recently sams had acquired a grant

206
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,560
from the ieee

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,280
we got both funding and a large amount

208
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
of volunteers

209
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,520
and the goal here was to create

210
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,319
eventually

211
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,120
uh to turn the existing museum space

212
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
into a

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
exhibit for the history as as well as

214
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
the current of

215
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,759
cyber security and encryption technology

216
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
and the existing museum and all of the

217
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,720
artifacts and the artifacts we have

218
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,000
in warehouse space at our r d warehouse

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
is going to be moved into a

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,479
much bigger much nicer

221
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,000
basically our end goal of museum

222
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,240
so what's the video wall all about uh

223
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,199
why would we

224
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,520
create this video wall the number one is

225
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,919
cyber warfare and education and they go

226
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,039
hand in hand um so as the world

227
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,680
continues to develop and change

228
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
so does the medium for war and terror

229
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
uh so as everything moves online and as

230
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,759
more and more devices

231
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,960
from refrigerators to defibrillators to

232
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,919
all sorts of different kinds of

233
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,680
equipment are connected to the internet

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,479
they become obviously the threat of the

235
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,840
subject of attacks

236
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,759
and cyber threats and so our goal is to

237
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,839
use this uh video wall to educate people

238
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
on and uh the next generation of cyber

239
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,279
warfare

240
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,559
cyber warriors on what cyber warfare is

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
and sort of some of the threats and the

242
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
preventions

243
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,040
that they can put in place

244
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,959
and also it's not just about cyber

245
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,880
warfare education

246
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
we are also using this uh display

247
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,000
currently

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,440
to display information about other

249
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
artifacts in the museum and give

250
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,480
education on

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
certain bits of history so it's used for

252
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,320
all sorts of different educational

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,800
purposes and finally small businesses

254
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,680
so a lot of small businesses can benefit

255
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,399
from

256
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,160
digital signage and other forms of

257
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,680
display that

258
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,640
usually involve uh large video walls

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,600
like this one

260
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,279
so this is to serve kind of as an

261
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
example

262
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
as well to small businesses that might

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
benefit from

264
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,120
having a large a similar large video

265
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,600
wall

266
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
to display a lot of information to a lot

267
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,959
of people at one time

268
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,800
so to talk a little bit about the images

269
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,320
in the top left is

270
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,600
a image of some edgewood isd

271
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
students uh at our cyber

272
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,560
simulator and we have

273
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,080
uh you can see the the system in all its

274
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,720
glory

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
you can see the server rack that's

276
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,760
driving in the background the four

277
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,519
massive 4k tvs and

278
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,399
some dual monitor raspberry pi 4s uh

279
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,080
that the students are able to interact

280
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,600
with

281
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,720
on the center left is what we eventually

282
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,640
hope to have as part of our museum which

283
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:06,959
is

284
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,480
a massive e arena for esports and

285
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,160
robotics competitions and all

286
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,680
live streams and all sorts of other

287
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
things and in the bottom left you can

288
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
see a concept drawing of the final

289
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
museum space

290
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,839
since the museum will be moving out of

291
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
the preview space to make way for

292
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
the cyber security and current

293
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,800
technology exhibit

294
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,880
all right so phases of development for

295
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
this project

296
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,399
if you are doing any sort of project

297
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,279
that involves

298
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,399
engineering uh or any sort of physical

299
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,200
creation

300
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,279
or even software creation you do want to

301
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,040
follow an engineering process it gives

302
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,680
structure

303
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,399
to your uh final project and make sure

304
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,079
that what you want to do is what you

305
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:46,560
will

306
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
get to do so it kind of ours ended up

307
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
falling under three phases and the first

308
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,279
two are

309
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,920
go hand in hand uh brainstorming and

310
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,480
design

311
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
so for brainstorming we kind of wanted

312
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
to plan out our goals what we wanted to

313
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,800
achieve

314
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,040
and how we wanted to achieve it and we

315
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
set up very general aspects of the

316
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,680
project

317
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
like where we were going to put it and

318
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,279
how much we were willing to spend on it

319
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,200
as far as design we picked exact

320
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,959
specifics for the project

321
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,279
um i my primary role was constructing

322
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:19,680
the

323
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,120
server uh and just writing the code to

324
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
get it up and running

325
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,760
um and we designed solutions for

326
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,279
both the server and also mounting and

327
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,880
running the displays

328
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
uh and then as far as construction it's

329
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,399
pretty self-explanatory

330
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
we carried out our design plans we built

331
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,519
everything uh

332
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,000
we put everything together and then put

333
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,040
finishing touches

334
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,800
and uh wrote the software to set it up

335
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,560
so for the brainstorming and design

336
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,240
phase uh

337
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,839
here are some general questions i want

338
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,760
you to keep in mind when i'm going over

339
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,639
this which

340
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,079
just uh guiding questions that we uh

341
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,519
we used to keep ourselves on track uh

342
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,279
what did we want to accomplish so

343
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,279
you know what what were our goals what

344
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
uh

345
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
what was the purpose of this which was

346
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
obviously education

347
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
uh how did we want to go about doing it

348
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,360
what would help us do it the best and

349
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
like i said what was our end goal so

350
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
we'll start out with server

351
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
um this is just uh

352
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,639
this is the build of the server uh

353
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,639
as you can see it has a graphics card oh

354
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,639
no server with a graphics card

355
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,480
uh it's not your typical server because

356
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,839
it is being used to drive

357
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
a display um and you may notice that i

358
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,079
put the ram

359
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,120
in the wrong slot in this picture uh but

360
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
we'll just talk about kind of

361
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,000
the components and why i chose them and

362
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
the building of it

363
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,519
so for the motherboard i chose the msi

364
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,880
b450a pro

365
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,760
it's an inexpensive ryzen compatible am4

366
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,720
motherboard

367
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,560
it was just right for our purposes and

368
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,920
it ticked all the boxes

369
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,279
for io and components and

370
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,519
coming in at just under 100 it was

371
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,800
really a steal at the time

372
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,399
you may notice that i have then and now

373
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,880
prices uh i wouldn't recommend building

374
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
this exact system now

375
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
uh because there are better bang for

376
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
buck uh

377
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,880
components out now and there are also

378
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,399
a lot of components that are much

379
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,399
cheaper now than they were

380
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
back then and there's also some that are

381
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
more expensive now than they were back

382
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,120
then

383
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
uh as far as processor i chose the ryzen

384
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,399
5 2600

385
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,200
which is really the middle of the road

386
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,920
for

387
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,200
amd processors it had enough horsepower

388
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
um where it wouldn't bottleneck or be

389
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,959
bottlenecked by

390
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,160
our gpu it had a high core count and

391
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,800
uh it's very fast it has low latency

392
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,399
which is perfect for our video display

393
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,440
application

394
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
and it was pretty inexpensive for its

395
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
performance at the time

396
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
and that was a major theme this isn't

397
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,360
you know an all out

398
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,959
completely uh 100

399
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,000
budget system or it was

400
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,320
more like a balance between price and

401
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
performance and that was what i was

402
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
shooting for when i was picking the

403
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,120
parts and constructing the system

404
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
as far as the graphics card we went with

405
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,720
the amd fire pro

406
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,240
firepro w9000 it is a lasting card but

407
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,079
we already had it in inventory it has

408
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,399
six

409
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
4k 60 displayport outputs um

410
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,560
and the blower design is what most

411
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,360
people would say

412
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
is you know not a good thing and it

413
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
usually isn't uh but in this instance

414
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,160
since i was building in a 4u server case

415
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,560
it was helpful to just have uh the fan

416
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,440
intake

417
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
fresh air from the case and blow it out

418
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
the back instead of blowing it back into

419
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
the case like most graphics cards

420
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
and like i said the primary reason we

421
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,639
selected this was because we already had

422
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,760
it in inventory

423
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,160
so we didn't actually have to pay for it

424
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,040
uh

425
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,320
we already had it now as far as memory

426
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
uh we chose this corsair vengeance lpx

427
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,440
2400

428
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
you may notice it's very very slow ram

429
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,760
but it is all we needed and ram prices

430
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,399
were

431
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,440
were very high when i was building this

432
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
and so it was kind of the best

433
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,360
ram i could get for 40 dollars it has an

434
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,639
integrated heat spreader which helps

435
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,600
with thermals

436
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,519
it's very low latency i think it's a

437
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,800
cast latency of

438
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,760
12 or 13 which sort of makes up for some

439
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,240
of that

440
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,920
uh slow speed and generally was just the

441
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
best choice for the budget

442
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,320
as far as storage this was a requirement

443
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
i was given to have a one terabyte ssd

444
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,680
uh i just chose a generic same sixty uh

445
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,560
samsung sig

446
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,240
860 evo that's a tongue twister um

447
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,040
because it was uh had a pretty low price

448
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,079
per gigabyte

449
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,519
it was uh pretty fast i know that there

450
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,120
are much cheaper nvme

451
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,839
drives that are out now that are much

452
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,720
much faster

453
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
for the same uh price and the same

454
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,839
storage space

455
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
however the prices were much much higher

456
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:55,759
at the time

457
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,920
and so those weren't really practical to

458
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,759
shoot for and also we didn't exactly

459
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,680
need the fastest storage ever because

460
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,440
it is a display server and so

461
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
also has really great thermals and

462
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,959
performance so that's what i went with

463
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,800
as far as the case just a simple sheet

464
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,959
metal for you rack mount case

465
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,959
uh i was not given a space restriction

466
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,399
of 2 or 1u

467
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,120
as most servers are so i decided to just

468
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,800
go with this so i could use the

469
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,519
stock amd cooler which they're actually

470
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,560
very impressive

471
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,240
thermal wise and so that um

472
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,519
you know we didn't have to go all out to

473
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,279
get a case with water cooling so that we

474
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,839
could keep thermals

475
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,240
reasonable so it also included 80

476
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,759
millimeter exhaust fans

477
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,600
and we ended up disabling these because

478
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
they were very loud

479
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
uh and we didn't actually end up needing

480
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,560
them but

481
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,279
it was a very nice thing for the price

482
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,160
and additionally

483
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,079
it had clearance for all our components

484
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,920
except for the gpu which i will talk

485
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,040
about a little more

486
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,240
later so

487
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,959
the power supply just chose basic evga

488
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,079
600 bronze

489
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,240
unit uh i chose it because it's

490
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,119
inexpensive

491
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,919
it has a high rpm fan built in for

492
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,119
really good thermals

493
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,160
um and it had it was pretty inexpensive

494
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,839
for a 600 watt power supply

495
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,799
at the time uh which i wanted to

496
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,520
overshoot

497
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,640
uh i i always overshoot in a pc build

498
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
normally about uh you know 40 or 50

499
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,839
power because if somebody wants to

500
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
eventually uh

501
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
you know scrap this pc and build a new

502
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
one or they want to upgrade this pc for

503
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,320
whatever reason

504
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,760
it's a big pain to have to invest

505
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
another 60 to 100

506
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,679
for a brand new power supply and so

507
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,200
getting one that's gonna last

508
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,080
and that can provide more than enough

509
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,559
power

510
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,400
is usually the best way to go

511
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
additionally add some very nice clean

512
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,320
sleeves black cables which although

513
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
nobody's going to be seeing them

514
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
was a nice aesthetic choice

515
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
front keys fan super generic thermaltake

516
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:57,600
fan

517
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,679
cheap we already had it in inventory

518
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,720
sorry

519
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,360
poor frankenstein modded 2 000 something

520
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
optiplex

521
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,919
um and so it was the right size it was

522
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,360
not very loud and it was a high static

523
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,559
pressure fan

524
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,640
so i just ripped it out of an old system

525
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
and popped it in the new one

526
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
um os i was given i know i know uh

527
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,280
windows 10 pro

528
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
but it was a qui requirement that i was

529
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,120
given uh it's a great operating system

530
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
for a lot of reasons

531
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,840
and also we needed uh radius domain

532
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,960
integration

533
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,880
uh and rdp just for management purposes

534
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
and also so that it could uh mesh with

535
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,880
our existing infrastructure

536
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
and it was only five dollars more than

537
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,000
the

538
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
uh five to ten dollars more than the

539
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,440
home version at the time

540
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,760
so we jumped for that uh total cost

541
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,559
16.50 um now it would be obviously a lot

542
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,600
more because some

543
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,320
component prices have shot up by quite a

544
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,120
lot

545
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,720
but you know that's a lot of money

546
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
that's actually uh

547
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,240
1 337 8.3 ounce cans of bush's baked

548
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,360
beans

549
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
including texas sales tax which is a lot

550
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
of baked beans and i would not have kept

551
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,559
this slide in here

552
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
if it were not for the lead reference

553
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,160
which was just

554
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,520
too perfect to not include

555
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
so the display we haven't talked about

556
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
the display

557
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
uh ignore the awful cable management we

558
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,559
fixed that

559
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,240
um for the monitors we went with a lg 82

560
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,360
inch 4k tv

561
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,480
it was a massive display for uh

562
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
only 1950 which was well within our

563
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
budget

564
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,559
although it may seem like a lot to spend

565
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
on a monitor uh

566
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
it's one of the greatest bang for buck

567
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
high quality uh high refresh rate it's a

568
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,919
120 hertz display

569
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,679
uh 4k tvs on the market so

570
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,200
the other reason we chose this is the

571
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,919
excellent warranty rma policy that lg

572
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,400
has

573
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,039
especially for their newer tvs uh

574
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,280
they're just super good about

575
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,919
dealing with uh problems that have

576
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,799
occurred

577
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,000
you know because of their shipping or

578
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,919
shipping or whatever and maybe we

579
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,200
actually got a

580
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,159
uh one of our tvs was broken it was kind

581
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,360
of a nightmare

582
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,880
but lg you know immediately within

583
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,440
a couple emails and some phone calls

584
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
they were

585
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,799
super great about getting sending us a

586
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,240
new one free of charge

587
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,960
really awesome

588
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,679
so um as far as mounting we went for

589
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,400
uh 80 20 aluminum extrusions so you may

590
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,679
be wondering why didn't we just mount it

591
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,720
to the wall

592
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,280
well it turns out that the arches in the

593
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,039
decommissioned chapel actually are

594
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,200
what's holding the roof up and so

595
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
cutting into those would probably have

596
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
been a very bad idea

597
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,919
so we decided to build a frame out of 80

598
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,840
20 aluminum extrusion which would also

599
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,720
give us

600
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,159
flexibility in mounting so we chose

601
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,240
aluminum extrusion out of all materials

602
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,440
to build the frame out of because it's

603
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
very strong

604
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,600
it's lightweight um and it's very cheap

605
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
and readily available

606
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,760
uh compared to some of our alternatives

607
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,360
and the modular design allowed us to

608
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
make a bunch of errors in design

609
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,880
if we needed to and still have a very

610
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,200
safe uh and sound

611
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
mounting system as well as you know keep

612
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,880
the gaps between the tvs

613
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,559
minimized and other things like that

614
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,080
so the code um what what makes it tick

615
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,320
it's not very complicated it's just some

616
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,120
short active

617
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,360
uh jscript and a little bit of activex

618
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,240
innovate

619
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,760
interfacing um so there's one of these

620
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
code blocks for each display there's one

621
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,799
not included here

622
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,400
uh so here are the two languages i used

623
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,360
batch and jscript what's batch batch is

624
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,960
basically the windows scripting language

625
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,480
it's a way of consolidating

626
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,000
multiple command line commands into a

627
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
runnable windows program and in this

628
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,159
case it was simply used to open and

629
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,600
close programs and

630
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,039
log any errors as far as

631
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,200
jscript jscript is actually not

632
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,880
javascript

633
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
it's a high level windows scripting

634
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,640
language

635
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,600
and it is actually also used in internet

636
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,320
explorer

637
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,440
web extensions but it is now

638
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,840
deprecated for some reasons um but the

639
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
big thing here is that

640
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,320
unlike javascript javascript it can

641
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,799
actually natively control activex

642
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,440
uh therefore you know it makes it a lot

643
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,320
easier to control

644
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,640
different attributes of a browser window

645
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,559
so how does it work the batch file just

646
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,720
starts the jscript and logs any problems

647
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,600
uh that come up or logs the success of

648
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,559
the running

649
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
um and then sets the browser windows

650
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,760
content size

651
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,480
and uh passes it over to the jscript

652
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,600
file which sets the

653
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,799
uh browser's content size position

654
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,320
and all the other attributes that needed

655
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,559
to be set up finally the processes

656
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
uh you know the jscript and the batch

657
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,360
the batch closes the jscript and then

658
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,280
itself and leaves nothing but the demo

659
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,400
content running

660
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,320
um and yes it's on internet explorer

661
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,760
i'll get to why

662
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,600
we chose internet explorer for that in a

663
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
second so

664
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
you know here's here's the code

665
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
breakdown uh here you can see all four

666
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,600
of them

667
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,480
so what we wanted to do here is we

668
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,039
wanted

669
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,760
to basically have an icon on the desktop

670
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,799
you could double click

671
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
and everything would come up on the

672
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,559
screens where you wanted them to come up

673
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,600
uh so each of these code blocks and

674
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,240
there's one for each window like i said

675
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,480
uh creates the first line creates a new

676
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,799
hidden window a new app

677
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,159
internet explorer window and we want to

678
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,240
hide it because we're going to do all of

679
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,840
the stuff we need to do to it and then

680
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,600
show it so that we don't see the loading

681
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,360
and the resizing and any kind of

682
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,679
visual glitches that would entail uh we

683
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,120
just have a clean experience we double

684
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,799
click and it all comes up

685
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,440
uh the next line just navigates the

686
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
window to the desired url

687
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,000
most of the uh urls we were using uh

688
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,960
were

689
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,120
you know just generic cyber threat maps

690
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,440
this particular window shows

691
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,760
kaspersky cyber threat map which looks

692
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,440
amazing on a giant screen like this one

693
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,720
um the next two lines vary uh as does

694
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,600
the url

695
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
because they control the positioning of

696
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,279
the window on the screen

697
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,919
and then we full screen it and show it

698
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,120
so

699
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
the full screen actually does not fully

700
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,200
work with internet explorer for some

701
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,000
reason

702
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,840
it always leaves a border but we'll get

703
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,120
get to that in a little bit so the

704
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
construction part

705
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,360
here's me from several several months

706
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,919
ago

707
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,559
uh just building the building away at

708
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,360
the server

709
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
here is the old deprecated server we

710
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
were using

711
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,840
we actually had a scale model in our r d

712
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,559
space you can

713
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,400
just catch a little glimpse of it here

714
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,760
uh but we have

715
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
what is the decommissioned commissary on

716
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,240
the air force base or the grocery store

717
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
is actually our r d space now so we had

718
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,840
this scale model with i believe they

719
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,440
were 455-inch

720
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,640
1080p tvs uh

721
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,480
excuse me uh just to test that the

722
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
server and everything was functioning in

723
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,760
the code as well

724
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,720
so uh you may notice that in in that

725
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,559
picture earlier you didn't see these two

726
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,159
giant drive cages well they were a

727
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,720
problem because um

728
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,760
the gpu we were using this chassis was

729
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,919
intended for a server which you normally

730
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,039
a server just has a cpu and a ton of ram

731
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,200
uh unless it's a rendering server which

732
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,279
this was not a rendering server chassis

733
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,120
um so the gpu that we were using was a

734
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,960
full reference length card

735
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,679
and so it didn't fit but the problem was

736
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,240
we

737
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,840
couldn't just take out all of these

738
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,520
drive cages were connected by the way

739
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,480
oops

740
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,799
all these drive cages were connected and

741
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,320
the problem is we couldn't just take it

742
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,799
all out

743
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,679
because this one is holding the

744
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,559
placeholders

745
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,240
for the drives in the front and we

746
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,600
didn't want to just have

747
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
an open slot not only because it's ugly

748
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,640
but

749
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,400
dust can get into the system and other

750
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,840
problems uh

751
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
whereas our actual intake over here is

752
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,960
filtered

753
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,799
and we can control the amount of air

754
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,080
that's going through the system

755
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,240
with the pwm fan so what we actually did

756
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,600
is uh we took

757
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,799
these two pcie slot placeholders

758
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,080
from this pc over here um and

759
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,120
we bent them with a sheet metal bender

760
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,760
and that's one

761
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,279
great thing about working in this shop

762
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,520
is that we our r d spaces that we have a

763
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
bunch of tools a metal shop a wood shop

764
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
and all sorts of other things

765
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,320
uh and we bend a sheet metal bracket out

766
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,919
of one of these old pci

767
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,120
uh old pcs pcie riser

768
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,320
uh and drilled some holes in it and used

769
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,159
mother stan motherboard standoffs for

770
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,919
eatx motherboards which we were not

771
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,720
using a

772
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
big server motherboard that we weren't

773
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,960
using within the case to mount

774
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,080
just that singular drive

775
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,678
cage to hold in the placeholders

776
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,799
and right here actually a fun easter egg

777
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,000
you can see me

778
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,360
taking the picture from the beginning uh

779
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,640
i don't know why i was holding the phone

780
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
like that uh but you can see me taking

781
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,919
the picture from the beginning

782
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,039
right over here so here's the server

783
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,919
rack here is

784
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,000
uh this was actually at the r d space

785
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,919
and then we updated it for the new

786
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,360
uh we updated it for the

787
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,799
actual like new final product uh

788
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,640
most of these things are placeholders

789
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,919
they're just old

790
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,640
servers uh and or networking equipment

791
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,840
the only things that are actually

792
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,120
functioning in this rack

793
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,200
and the same goes over here is the

794
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
switch and the server

795
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,520
and this little splitter box uh video

796
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,880
wall controller which at the time of

797
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,039
the creation of this presentation was

798
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,919
not actually connected to anything

799
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,480
uh we were just experimenting with it

800
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,080
and so

801
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,600
that's just and of course we had to add

802
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,840
some rgb because what's a good server

803
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,720
without rgb and so

804
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,640
that's it on the right you can see it

805
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,320
inside of these old

806
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,720
firewalls uh pictures taken by our cto

807
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,919
jorge modio

808
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,039
um so here's clearing out space

809
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,279
like i said earlier we had to clear out

810
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,159
most of that

811
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,399
uh retro computing exhibit and all of

812
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,559
the data point equipment

813
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,039
for the most part uh to make space for

814
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:23,840
the video wall

815
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,760
and the racks and all of the desks and

816
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,080
raspberry pi's with monitor setups

817
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,360
and so

818
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,039
excuse me and so we spent a large amount

819
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:35,600
of time

820
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,520
doing that here you can see our

821
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
wonderful ieee volunteers

822
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,640
manning the mounting of the displays the

823
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
frame was already up at this point for

824
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,840
the most part except for the horizontal

825
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,279
beams that connect the

826
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,720
uh monitors together but we used a rope

827
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600
and pulley system

828
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,440
as well as some come alongs to get the

829
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,279
tvs up there because

830
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
uh surprise surprise 82-inch smart tvs

831
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,039
are

832
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,240
very heavy and it takes uh you know

833
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,600
anywhere from

834
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,039
five to eight people to lift to them so

835
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,960
on the right this guy's not an ieee

836
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,559
volunteer that's my dad

837
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,240
my chauffeur and my bodyguard as he

838
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,080
likes to say

839
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,120
um on the left here you can see the top

840
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,880
two displays mounted and working

841
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,039
we had not done cable management yet but

842
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,640
don't worry about that i'll talk about

843
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,760
that for all you

844
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
people who love cable management as much

845
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
as i do uh and here you can see

846
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,159
david and our project manager manager

847
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,000
and lead volunteer ernest

848
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,399
uh just gawking at the beauty of these

849
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,840
two massive tvs

850
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,399
and here are the four once they were

851
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,120
mounted

852
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,080
and we powered up all the raspberry pi's

853
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,000
and you may see there's no rgb

854
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,440
we fixed that um

855
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
cable management so wow where are the

856
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,559
cables there's

857
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,039
there's one hdmi cable going to each tv

858
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,000
and i know what you're

859
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,760
saying you should be using displayport

860
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
you're running high refresh rate

861
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,120
high resolution um we did not have

862
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,080
displayport cables that were that long

863
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,600
and i'll talk about some issues with the

864
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,960
cabling later

865
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,240
as well but basically

866
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
those that's just the power cable and we

867
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,279
also managed that

868
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,679
but if you look very closely you can see

869
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,679
that the insides of the extrusion here

870
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,640
are actually

871
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,640
black so that is uh because we used hdmi

872
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,480
the the hdmi cables we used were

873
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,080
actually the perfect size to

874
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,679
pop into the extrusion um and so

875
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,600
it made cable management i wouldn't say

876
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
easy but very very clean

877
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,919
after we pressed in all of the hdmi

878
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,600
cables into the aluminum

879
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,880
which we didn't have to worry about

880
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
interference so much because they're

881
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,600
aluminum which isn't ferromagnetic

882
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,440
and so we ended up with a super clean

883
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
cable management job

884
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,799
that nobody could see if they decided to

885
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,640
pop peak their head behind the display

886
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,600
and see how it's all connected

887
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,120
so our conclusion what went wrong

888
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,640
so the first time around we actually

889
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
used the wrong hdmi cables

890
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,760
uh it is not easy on the fingers to

891
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,799
spend

892
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,440
four plus uh it ended up being more like

893
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,120
six hours pressing cables into the

894
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,000
extrusion

895
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,760
only to find out that the cables we were

896
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,679
using which were actually

897
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,760
uh the same cables we used in the

898
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,640
prototype

899
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,000
uh display at the fox works which is

900
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,799
what we call our rnd space

901
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,919
is they're not functional um

902
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,080
it's not the greatest thing ever to have

903
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,559
to redo all of that with cables that are

904
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,720
actually have a braided outside

905
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,240
uh made out of some kind of nylon or

906
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,039
vinyl

907
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,519
which is even worse on the fingers but

908
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,399
we got it done

909
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,799
and we got it functioning uh the problem

910
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,080
with the cables

911
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,760
uh that we have is that we've been

912
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
having some problems

913
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,519
like i said running uh 4k at 60 hertz

914
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,960
uh let alone 4k at 120 hertz

915
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,559
because uh the hdmi

916
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,960
i believe even the most recent hdmi does

917
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,159
not actually support above 4k 60 hertz

918
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,039
uh resolution wise or refresh rate wise

919
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,840
and so

920
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,440
we may be looking in the future at uh

921
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,519
using displayport also for you know

922
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,720
display integrity

923
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,600
and uh because displayport has a longer

924
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,320
uh

925
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
max cable length you can have and we're

926
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,799
working with 35 and 50 foot cables

927
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,320
uh which causes some stability issues so

928
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,840
in the future we may look into doing

929
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,440
that however it is just

930
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,960
basically digital signage and so we're

931
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,399
not really worried about high refresh

932
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:34,880
rates

933
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,640
uh or perfect 4k resolution

934
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,000
also our tvs are too smart uh

935
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,360
the display remotes which are pointer

936
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,440
based so you actually you know works

937
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,600
if if any of y'all remember the wii that

938
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,279
was my childhood console

939
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,760
it actually works the same way uh where

940
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,519
you have an infrared camera in the

941
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,000
remote

942
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,320
and it detects the little led on the

943
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,039
display

944
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,640
and it triangulates where the little

945
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,080
cursor is and you

946
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,840
basically by physically moving the

947
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,440
remote you uh

948
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,880
control different aspects of the display

949
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,480
and the location of the pointer on the

950
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,240
display uh

951
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,159
it it becomes tricky when you have four

952
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,519
displays side by side

953
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,279
because different buttons and the

954
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,120
movement of the remotes controls

955
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,640
uh the random just random displays so

956
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,159
you can have two of the displays on and

957
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,039
be trying to turn

958
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,279
on the other two or navigate somewhere

959
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,720
else on the other two

960
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,960
and um it turns off or controls the top

961
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,360
two

962
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,000
and it makes it very difficult so we're

963
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,919
still working on that

964
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,960
as well as the problem of powering

965
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,720
uh powering it all up which i'll get to

966
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,360
later uh also i wrote all the code for

967
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,080
the wrong

968
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,480
browser the first time i don't uh i've

969
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,600
nev never

970
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,159
before this used jscript i don't really

971
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,440
use javascript either

972
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,720
i'm a c-sharp and a java kiddo and so

973
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
uh it's very frustrating to spend hours

974
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,960
relearning and writing a language i

975
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,760
barely

976
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,640
ever use um to learn that we need to use

977
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,080
internet explorer not chrome

978
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,000
because chrome does not natively support

979
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,599
activex without jumping through a bunch

980
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,159
of hoops

981
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,760
so trying to get chrome to cooperate

982
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,839
with my code and move and wear

983
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,960
and do what i wanted it to do was

984
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,560
just really not um not working out

985
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,480
so if you saw chrome browsers in the uh

986
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,159
in that video it was actually those were

987
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,359
probably manually navigated to

988
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,679
so what could we improve the power

989
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,440
system or the startup it takes

990
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,159
several minutes for you know usually one

991
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,918
or two people are in the museum space at

992
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:38,800
one time

993
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
especially because of the coronavirus we

994
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
have had to close to the public and keep

995
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,599
less staff

996
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,440
there um and so when we are showing the

997
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,480
few people who

998
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
can go into the museum like executives

999
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,800
uh at the port or

1000
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,079
uh vips or whatnot uh when we're trying

1001
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,520
to show them the video wall

1002
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,640
a lot of times there are problems with

1003
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
a lot of times there are problems with

1004
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,760
getting

1005
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,000
all of it to turn on in time for them to

1006
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,800
not leave

1007
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,720
it takes about 10 minutes for one or two

1008
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,839
people to

1009
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,160
uh turn on the server get everything lit

1010
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,480
up turn on all of the raspberry pi's

1011
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
and turn on all of the tvs especially

1012
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
struggling with the remote problem

1013
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,520
so that is that is tricky the cabling

1014
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,720
i believe we already talked about the

1015
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,880
cabling but we've had some like i said

1016
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
we've had some problems and limitations

1017
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,560
driving the displays at the resolution

1018
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,160
refresh rate that we want to because

1019
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,040
we bought 4k tvs uh and we want to use

1020
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,079
all the k's

1021
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,440
uh of our tvs so

1022
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,079
uh i'll also display control uh the

1023
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,920
jscript in batch i wrote is

1024
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,760
good enough but it's not ideal so we

1025
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,440
were working on using a video wall

1026
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,119
controller and probably

1027
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,440
a professional video wall driver

1028
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,320
software

1029
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,200
uh to you know allow for easier

1030
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,000
adjustability

1031
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,079
so you don't need to understand my code

1032
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,359
to you know change

1033
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,599
attributes to not leave borders on the

1034
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,640
windows

1035
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,240
and other things like that to have

1036
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,680
programmable macros

1037
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,040
and whatnot uh for our displays

1038
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,240
so what are we going to do we're going

1039
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,359
to keep working

1040
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,480
uh this it's my personal

1041
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
uh belief that you're never really done

1042
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,560
with the project

1043
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,320
and that there's always something more

1044
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,240
that you can do to make it better

1045
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,200
uh and make it more impactful and so

1046
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,000
we're gonna keep

1047
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
doing our best to add more functionality

1048
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,160
and capability and more stability to the

1049
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,040
project

1050
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,880
uh also we're nowhere near finished

1051
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,079
which are with our

1052
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,079
act overall exhibit which is um

1053
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,400
you know the entire cyber security and

1054
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,200
history of the

1055
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,920
encryption exhibit uh so stay tuned

1056
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,119
there's more to come

1057
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,400
uh more on on the display uh

1058
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
this is our final sort of our final

1059
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,599
image of

1060
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,119
it after everything was done to it

1061
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,880
um we have added speakers uh

1062
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,040
large volume speakers so that we can

1063
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,000
blast sound

1064
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,040
down onto those who are sitting at the

1065
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,680
uh you know viewing an interactive space

1066
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,960
down here

1067
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,520
and we manufactured the mounts of those

1068
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,079
out of

1069
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,480
uh aluminum bar and also uh

1070
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,160
80 20 extrusion uh also you can see a

1071
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,920
little atm in the bottom right hand here

1072
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,720
stay tuned

1073
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,040
uh we've actually managed to get our

1074
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,400
hands on an atm

1075
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,240
thanks to those at broadway bank who

1076
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,079
decided to donate s1

1077
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,400
and we will be integrating that into our

1078
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,680
exhibits in the future

1079
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,839
so if you like the idea of atm hacking

1080
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,599
uh stay tuned

1081
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,359
so time to give credit where credit's

1082
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,800
due because i did not do this whole

1083
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,640
thing by myself at all

1084
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,040
uh david monroe and ernest frankie both

1085
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,680
played

1086
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,400
major roles in this project uh they not

1087
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,760
only assisted in

1088
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,320
in planning and kind of orchestrating

1089
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,880
the whole

1090
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,680
ordeal but they also uh and this is just

1091
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,800
really the cool part

1092
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,280
uh they also try very hard to work with

1093
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,520
us

1094
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,440
on the actual project itself and they do

1095
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,720
a lot of work

1096
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,880
on the low level and not just sitting

1097
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
back and telling us what to do

1098
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,160
uh so that's just really really cool uh

1099
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,720
especially uh i especially want to thank

1100
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,320
the ieee volunteers

1101
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,800
uh you know they were the brands and the

1102
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,200
braun of this project for the most part

1103
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,160
uh they really have been nothing but

1104
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
hardworking and they help uh

1105
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,079
they helped so much and continue to help

1106
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,680
so much

1107
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,359
jorge emilio as our cto jorge is

1108
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,839
just massive help with any kind of

1109
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,200
project like this

1110
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,119
you can actually see in his picture he

1111
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,560
helped a little bit in the background

1112
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,200
with the

1113
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,160
scale model in the fox works uh and he

1114
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,760
also provided some of the images in this

1115
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,880
presentation

1116
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,000
and finally i cannot there's no way i

1117
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
could do this presentation without

1118
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
thinking my dad

1119
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,760
he's not only my ride um

1120
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,599
which you know obviously there would

1121
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,359
have been some issues in the project

1122
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,480
without me

1123
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,200
and also uh he played a critical role on

1124
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,640
the project he helped with heavy lifting

1125
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,839
help with all of that

1126
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,839
and although he doesn't have a technical

1127
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,599
background he helped in consulting

1128
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,599
and in every way he could and made the

1129
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,680
whole thing possible

1130
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,800
there are also more uh but

1131
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,760
for the sake of brevity and the sake of

1132
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,560
you know

1133
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,480
keeping this talk at a reasonable length

1134
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
and not thanking people for

1135

uh something you're interested in me

1165
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,480
talking about

1166
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,520
more hey nilo um there are a couple

1167
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,960
questions in the in the

1168
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
breakout track so there's a track one

1169
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,640
breakout room on discord

1170
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,880
and so those up before you take off um

1171
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,560
as an old guy who's been doing this a

1172
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,160
long time it's pretty impressive to see

1173
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,920
someone who's 15

1174
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,319
doing a presentation at b-sides which is

1175
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,359
exciting

1176
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,480
um two questions i have for you

1177
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,400
uh how many other uh how many other

1178
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,119
folks are in your

1179
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,240
group over there at leigh um

1180
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,280
and do you have college plans

1181
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,760
so as far as i am the only one from

1182
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,680
israeli i just included that because

1183
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,160
it's where

1184
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,319
i go to school but there's no you know

1185
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,000
group or anything that goes and works at

1186
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,960
the museum

1187
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,680
uh i i was lucky enough to stumble upon

1188
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,400
the museum

1189
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,480
my mom saw it on a facebook page three

1190
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,520
years ago

1191
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,440
and we went and checked it out and i was

1192
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,640
invited to go over there start

1193
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,760
volunteering

1194
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,240
i started working with i was kind of in

1195
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,040
a

1196
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,319
a synthesizer phase uh and i i

1197
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,319
they had a giant um

1198
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,680
they had a giant uh analog modular

1199
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,720
synthesizer

1200
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,640
uh over there that they didn't have

1201
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,000
anybody that knew how to

1202
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,160
really work it and so that was kind of

1203
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,200
the thing i was

1204
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,480
uh i started out over there

1205
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,040
doing and then i ran the tesla coil

1206
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,760
shows

1207
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,880
and some tours and eventually i

1208
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,040
made my way over to the r d department

1209
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,560
where i worked i've worked on a bunch of

1210
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,240
projects like this

1211
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,920
as far as college plans i am

1212
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,160
you know my my top schools right now are

1213
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,440
ut and utsa

1214
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,040
they have both you know really great

1215
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,560
engineering programs they're close to

1216
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:30,960
home

1217
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,040
and they're just uh you know really good

1218
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,240
choice for me financially as well

1219
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,640
uh but so the those are kind of my

1220
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,760
college plans

1221
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,160
um you know i i want to major in

1222
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,480
electrical engineering probably

1223
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,240
and that's that's pretty much all i have

1224
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:59,839
so far

1225
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,680
