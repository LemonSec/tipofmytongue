1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,240
hey guys thanks for coming to mentoring

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,720
101 i am hoping you guys are as

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,279
passionate about mentorship as i am

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,720
but i guess i should go ahead and kick

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,559
off by introducing myself

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
my name is elle marquez and i'm the

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,559
community architect for

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,000
operation safe escape we're a 501c3

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
looking to help victims of domestic

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,039
violence

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,439
be able to take back their digital lives

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,439
we actually have a community channel in

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,320
slack so

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,160
if you're looking to maybe use your tech

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,359
skills to make

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,920
a big difference in someone's life go

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
ahead and jump in and we can talk to you

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,440
about what you can do

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,160
unfortunately that doesn't pay the bills

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,840
full time i guess i'm a community

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,480
advocate

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,559
that means i get to travel the world and

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,000
help people find their passion

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,760
help people figure out how to begin

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,680
their journeys and as a part of that

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,559
i've become

27
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,840
a technology evangelist i teach on

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,120
everything aws

29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
containers security i mean give me

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,480
three weeks and i'll teach a brand new

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,359
course on

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,840
whatever subject you want and i say that

33
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,080
not to brag but i say that because

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,040
when people ask me who i am i say hi i'm

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,760
lo punk

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,240
i'm a professional newb that might be a

37
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
weird title but it really

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,000
encompasses what i like to view myself

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,479
as i always say i'm not a subject matter

40
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,119
expert

41
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
and that's not to say something about

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,560
myself that's negative

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,960
it's because i don't want to be i never

44
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,000
want to be an expert

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
because that means that i myself view

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,520
myself as having learned

47
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,680
everything that i need to and if you've

48
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,520
been in tech more than 10 minutes

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,240
you know that it's constantly changing

50
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,960
so

51
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
i love to break things i love to break

52
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,240
things and fix them

53
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,479
and find new ways to break them i push

54
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,079
it to the point where the developers

55
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,000
and this has happened look at me and say

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,479
l that shouldn't be possible

57
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
and when that happens that's when the

58
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,320
real fun starts

59
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
but what i've learned is i don't have to

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,759
reinvent the wheel

61
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,600
there are people out there who've done

62
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
this probably longer than

63
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,079
i've been alive so i asked for help and

64
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,520
i know that's hard for some people

65
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
admitting what they don't know so that's

66
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,360
what i'm here to do today

67
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
i'm not here to talk to you about how to

68
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,479
be the perfect mentee

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,280
or how to mentor someone i can't give

70
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
you those skills

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
because those are skills that you

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
already have what i can do though

73
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
is take what i've learned and teach you

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
how to better wield those

75
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,120
so that you can really have not a career

76
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
but an adventure

77
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
well how am i gonna do that i'm gonna

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,239
tell you my story

79
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
and i do this not so you guys can say oh

80
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,239
i'm so sorry that you went through that

81
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:32,720
or

82
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,200
wow you've accomplished so much i'm

83
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
doing it so that

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,160
you can take my story and use it as a

85
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
template for your own

86
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
make it a choose your own adventure use

87
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
it as bullet points for what you want to

88
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,879
do next

89
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,519
use it as a way to view why it is that i

90
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,319
view the world

91
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,800
the way i do because one of the hardest

92
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
parts you're going to have

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,560
at being a mentor or a mentee is

94
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
breaking out of your

95
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
own head and understanding that everyone

96
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,239
doesn't speak your english everyone

97
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,440
doesn't understand

98
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
the way that you teach or what your

99
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,560
question is

100
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,879
but what before we get to that let's get

101
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,159
started with the story

102
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
and every good story has an origin

103
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,519
mine begins a long long time ago in

104
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,560
mexico

105
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,280
but that kind of makes me feel old so a

106
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,000
while ago

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,959
in mexico i hear a lot that i had a

108
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
disadvantaged background

109
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,599
and i hate that no i didn't have tv or

110
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
electricity or running water

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,400
but i had goats and horses and land and

112
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
over 100 cousins to hang out and play

113
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,440
with

114
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
that's why it was so difficult when i

115
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
came to the us

116
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
because i was put in special programs

117
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
for migrants and i was treated

118
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
like i was less than because i didn't

119
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
speak english so that was what we

120
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,000
focused

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
on not learning how to use computers but

122
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,879
i got through it and i graduated and i

123
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,400
did great and i had

124
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,159
great dreams of working with the

125
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
archdiocese so i studied

126
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
christian theology and i went back off

127
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,280
the grid

128
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,879
because i wanted to be able to help

129
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,799
people who grew up in the same

130
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,720
background as i did

131
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,360
but every story every story has to have

132
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
that negative moment when you try to

133
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,879
figure out if your main character is

134
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,480
going to make it through it

135
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,360
and mine happened in 2013 when i found

136
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
myself divorced

137
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
basically almost homeless and i had

138
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,680
no career no background i'd never held a

139
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
job and now i had three kids

140
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,560
that i had to figure out how to support

141
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
so i made the leap

142
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
i found out about a program called linux

143
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
for ladies

144
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
and this program was supposed to take

145
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
women who had

146
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
absolutely no technical background and

147
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
in the span of six

148
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,560
weeks six weeks teach them how to be

149
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
linux administrators

150
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,680
guys that was linux apache and my sequel

151
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,639
in six weeks it felt like it was

152
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,680
impossible

153
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
but the way that the group got through

154
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,560
it is we got through it as sisters

155
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,040
we relied on each other and just in case

156
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,919
you're wondering

157
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,800
that's me um we didn't focus on our

158
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
weaknesses we focused on our strengths

159
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
when the teacher left we'd stay after

160
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,199
class and say i have no idea what he

161
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,680
said like what the hell is a table and a

162
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
column in a database

163
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
that's how new we were and someone would

164
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,199
stand up and say oh that's easy and they

165
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,639
would draw it out and someone else would

166
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,479
say i still don't get it and somebody

167
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,160
would come up and explain it a different

168
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
way

169
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,440
i mean when it came to ssl i rocked that

170
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,680
thing and i taught all of them

171
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,360
maybe some other people helped but still

172
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,199
i was really good at it

173
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,840
and we accomplished great things most of

174
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,240
us

175
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
left the linux and the linux for ladies

176
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,520
program

177
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,400
red hat certified system administrators

178
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
in six

179
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,520
weeks we were proud but every good story

180
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
well every good story has a villain and

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
unfortunately my friends

182
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,960
you guys are the villains the community

183
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,360
because it didn't take long for me to

184
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
hear

185
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,319
that despite what i'd managed to

186
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,319
accomplish in six weeks

187
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,080
i was nothing more than a publicity

188
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
stunt i was able to get

189
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,919
a job interview at rackspace who ford's

190
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:08,880
fortune 500

191
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
that year had called one of the hardest

192
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,680
companies to even land an interview with

193
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
and i got the job but people only saw

194
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
that publicity stunt they only saw that

195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
i was a woman

196
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,680
or minority and that must have been why

197
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
i accomplished what i did

198
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
but my kids they'd gotten used to eating

199
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,960
so what can you do you keep going

200
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,600
and that's when i realized that you know

201
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
what

202
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,639
no matter what they said i had to be

203
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
able to accomplish my dreams and my

204
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,600
goals

205
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
so i did tickets and i worked and i

206
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
tried my hardest

207
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,960
to be able to give back to my team so

208
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,720
imagine the feeling that i had

209
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,919
when six months into my career one of

210
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,919
the texts on a different shift

211
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,880
reviewed my tickets and his feedback

212
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,520
which went

213
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,720
to myself and to my manager

214
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,080
was simply four words

215
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,759
i can tell you that those words what

216
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,240
four

217
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,039
almost five years later still hurt

218
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,680
because

219
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,800
i was really trying and

220
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
i decided you know what they're right

221
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,319
i'm an imposter

222
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
i don't deserve this i'm the publicity

223
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
stunt i need to step away

224
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,360
and let someone who can do this take

225
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
this job

226
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
so i went in the next day ready to

227
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,160
resign

228
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
the only thing that kept me from doing

229
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
it right away was trying to figure out

230
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,039
how to do it

231
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,440
and still keep my dignity so i'm sitting

232
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,240
there looking

233
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,199
at the computer and if you know me you

234
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,840
know that

235
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,319
i don't stay quiet for long unless

236
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
something's seriously wrong

237
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
so one of my teammates they kind of roll

238
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
over and they're looking at my screen

239
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,479
and they're like

240
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,759
ale would you break and

241
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
guys if you've been checking your email

242
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
i should stop saying guys i'm sorry

243
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
y'all if you're

244
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,319
checking your email right now or doing

245
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,560
your nails or talking to your kids

246
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,960
just focus for a moment because this

247
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
this is the most important part of this

248
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:07,759
talk

249
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,400
and that's because i had a moment there

250
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
i was given a moment in which i had to

251
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,199
choose

252
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,360
do i just shrug this off and say ah i'm

253
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,840
fine do i do what most of us say and oh

254
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
i'm just thinking don't worry about it

255
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
or do i show vulnerability and i decided

256
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
i don't have anything left to lose

257
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,520
so i looked at him and i told him what

258
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,879
was happening

259
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
what i realized now is what i did was i

260
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,719
took that moment

261
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,519
and i passed it on to him and there are

262
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,599
people who will do this for you

263
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
and you need to do what he did don't

264
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,080
shrug it off don't say oh that guy sucks

265
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
don't worry about it you're doing fine

266
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,000
oh you'll get better

267
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
no he took that moment and he ran with

268
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,120
it

269
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
and he said you know what let me take

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
those tickets i'm gonna review them

271
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
i'll get back to you i promise it'll be

272
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,160
more than four words

273
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,120
and thus enters our hero that's aaron

274
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,760
and

275
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,839
yes i have permission to use that photo

276
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,880
of him

277
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
so later he comes back to me and says

278
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,519
okay let's take a real look at this

279
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
here's where you started and you're like

280
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,279
oh customer something's wrong with your

281
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:13,920
server

282
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
what should i do and then from there you

283
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,959
went

284
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
customer your stuff's still broken

285
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,160
pick one of these and in the last few

286
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,920
months you've gone customer your stuff

287
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
was broken i fixed it

288
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
close a ticket yes you are doing the

289
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,880
same work

290
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,440
over and over again but you're growing

291
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,560
your confidence

292
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,839
so the next step is to take something

293
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,240
harder

294
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
and i want you to hear that and say that

295
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
there was never a formal agreement for

296
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,360
mentorship

297
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,880
he never said all right el i'm your

298
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
mentor this is what we're going to do i

299
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
have your career planned out for you

300
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
and i never looked at aaron and said

301
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,200
okay i want to grow will you mentor me

302
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,839
it was just one person who saw a need

303
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
and one person who asked for it

304
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
and what i saw is what we ended up doing

305
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,800
was we changed the culture of our team

306
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
because i'd look at aaron and say man i

307
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
don't understand why the server

308
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,959
is paging so much and it has enough

309
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,920
memory

310
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,600
and then he would start explaining and

311
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,959
kevin behind him would say

312
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,079
wait aaron have you thought about x and

313
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,399
then

314
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,560
corey behind me would say you guys are

315
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
making this way too deep

316
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,399
all right i'll look at this whiteboard

317
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,640
and he would draw it out for me

318
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,760
it no longer was asking stupid questions

319
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,440
it was 100 growing our team

320
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,959
once again no formal mentorship no court

321
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,680
program

322
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
just people helping each other grow but

323
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
to me

324
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,360
this is the key foundation of what

325
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
mentorship is

326
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,880
because a mentor is simply someone who

327
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
helps you fill your knowledge gaps to

328
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
seek opportunities to help you grow and

329
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
excel

330
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
that's all they wanted to do and a

331
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
mentor is someone who

332
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
can let your guard down who share your

333
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,480
insecurities

334
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,040
that moment of vulnerability and to ask

335
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,800
all those stupid questions

336
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
that we all have sometimes and if you're

337
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
one of the people that always says

338
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,399
there's no such thing as a stupid

339
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,240
question quit it

340
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,480
because when you're the person asking

341
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,519
the question

342
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,600
trust me there's such a thing as a

343
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,880
stupid question

344
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
and if you keep saying that there isn't

345
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,480
it makes me feel

346
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
like i'm the only one that doesn't know

347
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,360
enough to be able to ask

348
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
i once heard the saying that people come

349
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
into your life

350
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,920
for a reason a season and a lifetime

351
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,880
this right here

352
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,279
is what i want to be the way that you

353
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
guys view mentorship

354
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,279
because i truly believe that everything

355
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,800
happens for a reason

356
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,040
and what i'm asking from you today is

357
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,519
for you to be that reason

358
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,760
what my talking with corey and talking

359
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,959
with aaron did

360
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
is it planted all these different seeds

361
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,480
that began to grow

362
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,959
seeds that completely engulfed the

363
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,880
concept of embosser syndrome so i

364
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,399
couldn't even think about it

365
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,200
because i was having too much fun and

366
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
one of those seeds

367
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
really began to flourish see aaron's a

368
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
great guy and he is a great teacher and

369
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
i spoke to him last week we're still

370
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,200
connected

371
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,639
but corey corey could speak my english

372
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,360
he taught the way that i learned i asked

373
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
him a question about the osi model and

374
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,320
he says don't worry about that

375
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,079
let's talk about a post office and the

376
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,519
way that letters go

377
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,120
in the end he goes all right let's take

378
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
that story and break it apart into each

379
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,959
part of the osi model

380
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,920
i will always remember that when i

381
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
learned about paging he's sitting there

382
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
handing me books talking about swapping

383
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,480
feeling that book and remembering that

384
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
memory will help me be able to grow

385
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,959
and so we entered a season i became very

386
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,880
comfortable with asking him questions so

387
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,639
when i was ready to move on

388
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,040
and grow from a linux one admin i was

389
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
like all right i got this i'm gonna

390
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,519
become a level two

391
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,440
corey here all the things that i need to

392
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
do to be able to pass the test

393
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,200
this one i know this one i know i don't

394
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,959
even know what that says

395
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,720
can you help me figure out an action

396
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,480
plan to do my learning

397
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
once again i never said hey corey will

398
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,000
you be my mentor

399
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,839
will you figure out everything that i

400
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,600
need to do he never looked at me and

401
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,560
said we got this

402
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,040
this is what you need to do i just asked

403
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,600
questions

404
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
i didn't ask him to teach me specific

405
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,760
things i asked him to help me set the

406
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,480
groundwork for what i needed to do

407
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,920
so you've been listening to this for a

408
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,399
while and some of you may going all

409
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,200
right elle

410
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
that was a great story right good for

411
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
you you did the thing

412
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
but what i'm here to learn today is to

413
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
figure out how do i get

414
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,519
a mentor i'm not you i don't have that

415
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,760
vulnerability

416
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,600
if you've been listening to this you

417
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
know what the answer is

418
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,519
and if you've tuned out i can tell you

419
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,399
that you're not

420
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,639
gonna like the answer because what you

421
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,920
need to do

422
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,720
is you need to quit looking for a mentor

423
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,120
it's

424
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
fruitless you're not going to hand your

425
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,199
career over to somebody else

426
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,519
and have them build a successful one for

427
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,720
you because

428
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,959
they're not you they don't view the

429
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,800
world the way you do they don't have

430
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
the same experience as they do and even

431
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,279
though they might understand the concept

432
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:03,680
like

433
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,839
i want to be an sre or i want to be a

434
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,040
linux admin

435
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
they don't understand why you wanted to

436
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
do it therefore they can't craft

437
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,639
what you need to do what you need is

438
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,440
teachers

439
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
you need to find those people that when

440
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,199
you ask them a question they light up

441
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,800
and they just start talking to you

442
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
and they start teaching you and they

443
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
have no ulterior motive

444
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
other than being excited about the

445
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,519
subject

446
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,760
but make sure you find someone who

447
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
teaches the way that you learn

448
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,199
i have some friends that if you hand

449
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,720
them white pages

450
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,480
man give them a couple hours and they

451
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
will be able to break things down for

452
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,040
you

453
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,199
i can't do that you give me white pages

454
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
i'll be ready in a year

455
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
you give me videos maybe six months

456
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,320
you sit someone down in front of me so i

457
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,880
can ask

458
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,959
questions and so we can learn together

459
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,920
i'll be ready in six weeks

460
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
with that though you need to look for

461
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,959
your moment

462
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,519
and you need to take it you need to find

463
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,480
the courage

464
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
just to ask a simple question and not to

465
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,760
feel that it has to be this big blown

466
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,519
out thing where you have to come back to

467
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,480
that

468
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,079
just ask just say hey i don't understand

469
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,639
why this mysql server is completely

470
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,760
sharding itself

471
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,399
and yes that's actually a thing and then

472
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,240
go back to that person and say hey i

473
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
really loved the way that you explained

474
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,519
that

475
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,399
can i ask you one more question don't

476
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,440
worry about a formal mentorship

477
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,240
but with that when you ask questions be

478
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,759
willing to ask more

479
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,680
nothing is more heartbreaking to me than

480
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,600
when somebody asks me to help them

481
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,160
i'm excited if you can't tell i love

482
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,079
mentorship and i love learning so i'm

483
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,600
just going on and on

484
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,920
and they're nodding along and by the end

485
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,000
i realized i lost them and they

486
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,399
haven't the slightest clue what i was

487
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,759
talking about

488
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,320
but they walk away i've had this happen

489
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
and i'm like wait wait stop

490
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
i understood every third word of that

491
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,399
alphabet soup that you just spoke

492
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,720
so let's break it down forget explain it

493
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
to me like i'm five

494
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,240
explain it to me like i'm too and i've

495
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,079
had people call me out and then say okay

496
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:08,560
you're just

497
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
you know making yourself seem worse

498
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,000
you're making yourself look bad

499
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,399
i don't care i want to learn i don't

500
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,560
care what i look like in that moment

501
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,440
because way i'm going to prove myself is

502
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,759
by being able to go out and do

503
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,320
what i learned and in that when you're

504
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,759
asking for help

506
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,120

507
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
and so i'll have people come up to me

508
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240

i don't know can i what do you want do

512
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,839
you want to learn about networking

513
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,759
do you want me to review your resume do

514
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,839
you that isn't a question

515
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,240
for me that is taking all of the

516
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,440
emphasis

517
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,519
and putting it on me being like all

518
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,440
right i don't know what i'm doing you

519
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,480
figure it out

520
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,639
i have kids i have a new relationship i

521
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,160
want to learn myself

522
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,639
i don't have the time to take on your

523
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,240
your burden

524
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,279
but within that be open to failing

525
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
i found the best mentor when i was

526
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,959
looking to get into openstack

527
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,319
this guy spoke in a way that i mean

528
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,079
cool things when my lights would just

529
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
turn on and what should have taken me

530
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
six months to learn in six hours i had

531
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,039
it down

532
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,520
so i said okay would you help me in this

533
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
season because i want to grow in this

534
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,240
area

535
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
and he looked at me and said no i can't

536
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
and i think he saw how it was a little

537
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,280
heartbroken

538
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,799
he goes my wife is due to give to have

539
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,360
lord my wife is due to have our baby

540
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,480
pretty soon

541
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,919
she would kill me if i took this on

542
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,400
some people might view that as a failure

543
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,039
i just

544
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
asked hey do you know anyone else that

545
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
can help me

546
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,559
but how do you know what your question

547
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,960
is i have a talk that says you know

548
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,039
uh containers how to know what you know

549
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,640
that you don't know how to know like

550
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,520
that is such a complicated statement but

551
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
when you don't know how to start

552
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
that's how it start up that's how it

553
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,320
feels so what you need

554
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,799
is you need an action plan and there are

555
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,960
several different ways that people go

556
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
out and they talk about this

557
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,720
they're great being able to uh bullet

558
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,440
journal

559
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,160
it's a great thing i see a lot of really

560
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,559
cool decorations in bullet journals

561
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,200
that kind of keep you from focusing on

562
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
your plan

563
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,720
and i hear people talk about okrs hey

564
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,240
i've done okrs

565
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,240
but i do okrs after i've already set up

566
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
what it is that i want to do so the way

567
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,760
that

568
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,679
i want to teach you is smart goals

569
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,200
i don't know if people might be like

570
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,799
leaving the chat right now and just

571
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,240
watching another talk

572
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
people have a really big hatred for

573
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,400
smart goals

574
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
and i think that's because when they're

575
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,760
taught they're taught so

576
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,400
stringent it's like okay let's draw this

577
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,840
out and you're gonna fill out each

578
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
individual part and then somebody goes

579
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,720
and grades it

580
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,200
like okay that's not specific enough and

581
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
that's not measurable

582
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
how do they know they don't know you

583
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,400
right what these things mean to you

584
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,440
is completely individualized this

585
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
is one of those tools that i can't teach

586
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,960
you how to use

587
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
i can teach you how to yield wield it

588
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,160
but

589
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,520
this has to be all you recently i have

590
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
taken on a new mentee and

591
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,679
i thought i was liberal this quote is a

592
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,520
freaking wild child

593
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,720
like trying to get her to focus is

594
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,320
almost impossible she's a fairy she's

595
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,919
all over the room

596
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,720
but what i learned is the moment i start

597
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
speaking the way she learns

598
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,080
whether she's running around the room

599
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,840
she's listening so when i

600
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
decided to teach her smart goals this

601
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
didn't mean anything to her

602
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,120
she doesn't care if something specific

603
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,600
but she does care if it's significant to

604
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,480
her

605
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
she doesn't want to measure things like

606
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,640
who has time for that

607
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,000
but it's meaningful she'll work at it

608
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it's attainable okay and i could walk

609
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
you down the rest of these but

610
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,480
you need to find the words that speak to

611
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,799
you why is it that you're looking to

612
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,280
change

613
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
jobs why is it that you're looking to

614
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,360
get into security

615
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,799
your why is yours and that's the first

616
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,240
step to looking for

617
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,200
a teacher is to know what you want them

618
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
to teach you

619
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
so i want to show you the way that i was

620
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,720
able to accomplish this and

621
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,520
finally leave being an admin because i

622
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,240
didn't like it

623
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
all right i worked at openstack

624
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,080
openstack is

625
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,919
the cloud comp our booklet openstack i

626
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,520
worked at rackspace

627
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
and rackspace is the cloud company

628
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
that's what they advertise themselves

629
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,799
for so

630
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,559
i should learn the cloud if i want to

631
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,240
progress right

632
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
that my friends is a dream like i want

633
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,840
to learn the cloud

634
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,679
cool i want to learn a marathon i want

635
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,039
to do a lot of things

636
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,280
but how many of them do you actually

637
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,559
accomplish

638
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,559
so i needed to make this a little bit

639
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,000
more specific

640
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,919
because who in the world even knows what

641
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,159
the cloud is it's a lot of jokes on that

642
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,360
you should google it

643
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,280
but anyways i worked at the openstack

644
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,880
company so i said okay

645
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,039
i'm gonna learn openstack that's pretty

646
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,280
specific i know exactly

647
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,400
what i'm gonna tackle right

648
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,480
is that measurable i mean like how do

649
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,919
you know when you know openstack i got a

650
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,520
job i know this

651
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,360
if you've ever been new to a job which

652
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,280
i'm guessing some of you are

653
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
you don't know anything the moment you

654
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,480
get that job

655
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,919
so maybe that's not measurable i found

656
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
out though that as a part

657
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,240
of the openstack technology rackspace

658
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
had written a

659
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,840
certification program around it all

660
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,480
right

661
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
i'm going to become an openstack

662
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
certified administrator

663
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,840
either i am or i'm not that simple

664
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,679
that's measurable is it attainable

665
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,559
that one was hard because i wanted it

666
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,480
and i wanted it to be attainable

667
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,880
but i had three kids at home i was still

668
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
having to do my day job

669
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,960
i had three mentees who were in their

670
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,039
season who i was trying to help

671
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,760
become linux admins i had a study group

672
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
that i was running at the same time i

673
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,200
should have turned my phone off

674
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
um at the same time i didn't have the

675
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,400
time

676
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,520
i it wasn't attainable at that moment

677
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,679
so i took a break from my smart goals

678
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,440
you don't have to rush through them it's

679
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,480
like okay

680
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,200
let's take a moment i had somebody else

681
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,720
take over my study group

682
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,200
i helped each one of my mentees be able

683
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
to find a new mentor

684
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,440
i sat my kids down and said alright look

685
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,919
mom

686
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,320
wants to do new things do you know how

687
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
you go up to the next grade in new grade

688
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,039
and you've learned

689
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,200
to read more and you learn new math

690
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,720
that's what i want to do

691
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,320
so i'm going to sit at this table with

692
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
you guys while you're studying and i'm

693
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,360
going to study too

694
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
and i'm going to take a test just the

695
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,640
way you guys do

696
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,440
when they understood that it made this

697
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,000
dream

698
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,200
completely attainable to me

699
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,320
all right so next is it realistic

700
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,520
well yeah yes this is when you start

701
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,240
kind of

702
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,880
doubting yourself like oh i could but i

703
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
don't know if i'm good enough

704
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,400
screw it rackspace had a training team

705
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,720
so i got really proud and i walked up

706
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,760
there and i said

707
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,000
i want to become an openstack certified

708
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,960
administrator

709
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,760
will you guys help me and byron looked

710
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,600
up and said who are you

711
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,559
and okay so maybe i i went the wrong way

712
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,520
about that

713
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
but you know what i didn't know and i i

714
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,000
didn't know about smart goals quite yet

715
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,760
i didn't know how to develop them

716
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
so i sat down with them and we started

717
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,280
talking and i don't know if matt is

718
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,720
actually in this talk right now because

719
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,559
he runs the k-8s group

720
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,880
but he really took me under his wing he

721
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
gave me vms to practice on he

722
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,240
broke down the test for me it was a

723
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,360
wonderful way

724
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
for me to get started and once again i

725
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,760
didn't ask for a mentor

726
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,919
i just asked for questions when i had

727
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,159
them i asked for answers when i had

728
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,919
questions

729
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,520
and so i said okay matt you told me that

730
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,000
each

731
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
one of these parts of the test is broken

732
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,080
down into domains

733
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,520
that's attainable it's that whole

734
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,000
concept of how do you eat an elephant

735
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,480
one bite at a time how do you pass the

736
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,200
test

737
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,679
by figuring out each section that you

738
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,960
need to study not

739
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,480
focusing on the big picture just yet

740
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
this was realistic to me i could tackle

741
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
this

742
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,880
the next one guys there i go again the

743
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,159
next one y'all

744
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,279
don't be like me i am insane

745
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,120
and anyone who knows me that's listening

746
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,480
to this right now will

747
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,679
back it up i decided that

748
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,799
i was going to do this in

749
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,360
60 days that was the time that i gave

750
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,000
myself

751
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,279
two months from what's openstack too

752
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,640
i got this i'm certified it was hard

753
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,200
i asked so many questions i would go up

754
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,360
to the admins and say okay

755
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,279
what are these logs saying i don't even

756
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,400
know what i broke

757
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
and i remember one of them asking me

758
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
what customer is this for

759
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,720
it's like myself that's when they got

760
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,360
interested

761
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,279
they were excited that somebody wanted

762
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,799
to know what they did

763
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,120
so now i had a training team and i had a

764
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,799
group of admins

765
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,080
willing to answer anything so yeah i got

766
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,159
certified in 60 days

767
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
and one of the coolest parts is about

768
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,480
that time matt decided to move on and

769
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
look for new things

770
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,559
the training team said we know the way

771
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,520
you think

772
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,279
we know the way that you break things

773
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,400
down how would you like to work with us

774
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,720
aside where uh that's just an amazing

775
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,679
part of

776
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,000
looking for teachers and not mentors is

777
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,600
they become some of your biggest

778
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,520
advocates

779
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
this plan though doesn't always work and

780
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,679
as i told you guys sometimes

781
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,240
you have to embrace failure when i

782
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,000
started working at linux academy they

783
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,039
said l

784
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,120
write a program on write program write a

785
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,640
course on containers

786
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,880
no clue what containers were so i'm

787
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,640
trying to tackle this and i'm trying to

788
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,200
you know

789
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,159
still go for my i guess my passions and

790
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,480
still take care of my family

791
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,520
what i hit was burnout i was done

792
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,080
so i decided i'm gonna do something that

793
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,559
i'm

794
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,480
passionate about so i sat down with a

795
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,799
piece of paper and i thought to myself

796
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,840
l what do you want this is actually the

797
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
piece of paper that i drew it on

798
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,480
i love you guys i love security i love

799
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,760
the community

800
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,960
i want to learn about security that's a

801
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,080
great dream

802
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,000
so we need to break it down and i asked

803
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,760
a few people i asked cinders and ash i

804
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,679
asked sciatic nerd i said

805
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,240
how do i get started and they said

806
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,159
you're great you help out a lot you

807
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,159
don't know what we're talking about

808
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,760
why don't you start with your security

809
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,080
plus it'll give you a foundation to just

810
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,039
understand the alphabetic suit all right

811
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:49,919
that's measurable

812
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,320
once again either i am or i'm not it's

813
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,080
attainable i have all of you guys i

814
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,240
literally have a community

815
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,200
of people willing to help me is it

816
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
realistic

817
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
i just started a new job i had

818
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
everything that i told you guys about i

819
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
was fighting burnout

820
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
maybe not so i went to my boss and i

821
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
said this is important to me

822
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,880
i want to do this and i'm willing to

823
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,360
you know what take a back seat whatever

824
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,279
like i will do what you need me to but

825
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,760
i'm not putting anything extra in

826
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
i know that's almost impossible for most

827
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,159
people but i had an amazing relationship

828
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,240
with my manager and he said okay

829
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,480
you know what find a way to make your

830
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,000
passion and what you want to do

831
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,080
something that we can benefit for so i

832
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,919
started running study groups like i need

833
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,399
to learn

834
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,159
other people need to learn let's put

835
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,240
these on the web and do it together

836
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,120
from there i started podcasting you know

837
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,200
willing to admit my failures

838
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,520
meant that other people wanted to teach

839
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,440
so i brought on industry professionals

840
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,159
and i asked

841
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,720
questions and it was a wonderful

842
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,960
experience for me and really helped me

843
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,679
fight burnout and so i said okay i'm

844
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,159

845
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,919
pass that exam and did i tell you guys

846
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,120

847
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,440

875
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
burned out now i had to teach a workshop

876
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,480
in it

877
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,600

878
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,320
days

879
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,720
a little bit of a panic attack oh yeah

880
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,760
since you're done with that

881
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,120
can you attend cubecon 2 i was done

882
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
there was no way that i could accomplish

883
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,640
this

884
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,559
but i told you guys that i'm crazy right

885
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,080
so i said screw it

886
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,640
i'll push it back a little bit april 1st

887
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
april 20th what's the difference between

888
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,919
20 days and 30 days

889
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,600
i'll get this before i even have to

890
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,399
start everything out

891
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,520
maybe not this was my tweet saying hey

892
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,880
i couldn't do it maybe i'll prolong

893
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
you know my experience i ended up giving

894
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,480
up

895
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,919
that burnout will bite you every single

896
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,279
time

897
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,200
but this is where i want to be different

898
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
and i want you guys to be it

899
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,360
even when you're working with mentors

900
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,399
even when you've

901
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,399
set that goal and you just know you're

902
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,640
going to accomplish it failure is part

903
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,679
of the ride

904
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,600
so the way that i live my life whether

905
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,760
it be personal and technical

906
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,320
it's a great quote from samuel beckett

907
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,760
that really spoke to me

908
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,279
he said ever tried ever failed no matter

909
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,000
try again fell again but felt better

910
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,200
what have i told you guys i

911
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,640
love to break things to the point where

912
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,399
the developers start questioning their

913
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,520
own code

914
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,440
because you won't believe what you can

915
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,399
accomplish by attempting the impossible

916
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,320
with the courage to repeatedly fail

917
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,919
better no

918
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,880
i did not get my sac plus in the time

919
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,559
i'd allotted to myself

920
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,799
but when the end the year i'd gotten my

921
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,840
g sec

922
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,679
and thanks to some mentors that i had

923
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,240
along the way i went back and i don't

924
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960
know with like

925
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
three days worth of studying because i'd

926
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,120
been doing that work all along

927
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,000
i passed my stack plus it took me way

928
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,520
longer than i thought

929
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
but finding those mentors to cheer me on

930
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,159
finding those people to be advocates

931
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,399
finding those teachers that were willing

932
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,840
to take a moment

933
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,960
really helped me accomplish my dream

934
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,679
and as you can tell it was about one day

935
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,559
before my

936
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,760
third voucher actually expired

937
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,039
so those of you that are going you know

938
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,120
what el i've accomplished so much i'm

939
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,039
exactly where i want to be

940
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,799
but what i want to know is how can i

941
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,159
help others how can i

942
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,519
be that mentor that they need me to be

943
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,840
remember you're not there to do their

944
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,720
job for them

945
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
help them develop smart goals talk to

946
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
them about what it is that they want to

947
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,519
do

948
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,480
but in the end your job is simple be

949
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,120
open

950
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,919
be honest be vulnerable be open for

951
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:30,720
those moments

952
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,960
look for them there are times that i

953
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
don't need

954
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,159
i don't know that i need a mentor or a

955
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,039
teacher i'm just

956
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,120
mad at myself i can't understand why i

957
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,640
can't learn something that's so

958
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,679
simple for everyone i remember throwing

959
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,080
the

960
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,200
biggest hissy fit being in tears

961
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,519
because i couldn't understand a freaking

962
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,360
kernel parameter that everyone on my

963
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,600
team did and i was like flip the table

964
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,000
pissed off and corey looks at me he goes

965
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,799
okay

966
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,480
let's step back for a moment what you're

967
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
saying is that you really didn't

968
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,039
understand

969
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,200
the whole concept of swap that you

970
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,480
didn't understand how this was

971
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,840
configured

972
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,080
when you're ready come to me and i'll

973
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,200
help you learn that

974
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,519
he gave me my space he let me feel what

975
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,120
it is that i needed to feel

976
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,279
but he helped me have an out so that i

977
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,399
could go and

978
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,760
tackle it all over again with that be

979
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,640
honest

980
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
i don't know how many times my career

981
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,240
has been set back

982
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,080
because i go and i ask somebody and

983
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,159
they're too ashamed to admit that they

984
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,200
don't know

985
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,440
so they tell me this big convoluted

986
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,600
story with lots of acronyms that make

987
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
them sound so good

988
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,919
so then i spend months trying to dissect

989
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,559
that because

990
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,159
obviously they know they wouldn't have

991
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,240
set me on the wrong path and the more

992
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,679
that i learn the more that i

993
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720
realize they're full of hot air they put

994
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,919
my career back pretending to be teachers

995
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,640
it's a horrible feeling but also be

996
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,600
vulnerable

997
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,080
when we take on a mentee when we start

998
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,440
teaching somebody we

999
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,200
want them to know that we're going to

1000
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,720
set them straight we know what we're

1001
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
talking about you can have confidence in

1002
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,840
me

1003
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
no one wants the perfect teacher no one

1004
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,600
wants the perfect teammate

1005
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
they want somebody who's human somebody

1006
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,360
who has failed that can teach you

1007
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
from their failure someone who has

1008
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,200
modesty who can take the time

1009
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,240
and acknowledge that things are hard

1010
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,200
that vulnerability is what makes you an

1011
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,440
amazing teacher

1012
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,640
i said that i'm telling you a story and

1013
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,200
every story has to have an ending right

1014
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,480
i don't know mine yet

1015
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,440
i've been in tech five maybe six years i

1016
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,600
have so many goals that i want to

1017
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,480
accomplish

1018
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,640
because to me it's not a career it's an

1019
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,720
adventure it's a story

1020
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,559
that's what i want you to start viewing

1021
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,080
it as enjoy

1022
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,640
what you're doing and if you don't find

1023
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,360
it

1024
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,600
use the teachers along the way to be

1025
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,559
able to pursue your dreams because

1026
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,720
the last part is a lifetime right and

1027
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,799
the best gift that any of my teachers

1028
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,600
had given me

1029
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,840
is the adventure that i had along the

1030
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,360
way now introduce you to one last person

1031
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,640
this is corey corey was there the

1032
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,760
very first day i had my first interview

1033
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,679
and i remember him asking me a question

1034
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,440
about session persistence

1035
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
and he'd be like i have no idea so i

1036
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
gave that big convoluted answer and he's

1037
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,480
like just stop

1038
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,159
just stop you don't know what it is

1039
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,000
admit it tell me how you would

1040
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,440
troubleshoot it

1041
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,839
and move on and at the end i said all

1042
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,280
right will you tell me what session

1043
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,199
persistence is and why you asked me

1044
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,440
i said you know what go look it up

1045
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,239
figure it out

1046
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,879
here's my email get back to me i did

1047
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,599
that and hey

1048
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,359
i got the actual interview besides the

1049
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,679
phone interview i got the job

1050
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,239
i walk into my team the first day and

1051
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,280
there's corey

1052
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960
remember when i talked about corey who

1053
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,040
sat behind me who started drawing out

1054
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,440
who learned to teach me the way that i

1055
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,320
learned

1056
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,119
same guy so now i'm ready for my new

1057
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,119
adventure i want to learn new things and

1058
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,000
i decided hey

1059
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,920
programming is probably something that i

1060
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,440
need to understand

1061
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,599
so what three days ago i called corey up

1062
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,960
and i said hey corey

1063
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,720
this is what i want to learn can you

1064
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,640
help me kind of develop an action plan

1065
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
like i've got my smart goal but i don't

1066
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,760
know the first step

1067
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,280
i said you know what go and build

1068
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,200
something whatever spend an hour

1069
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
figure out a script i'll give you a zoom

1070
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,680
call we'll start dissecting it together

1071
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,359
there's no promise of a mentorship

1072
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,599
there's just somebody reviewing my code

1073
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,440
despite the fact that he's been my

1074
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,599
teacher for six years

1075
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,200
now i can't promise that this is gonna

1076
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,079
work for you i can't there's no way for

1077
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,960
me to say

1078
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,880
if you try this you're not going to fail

1079
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
and honestly i hope that along the way

1080
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,640
you do fail because that's going to be

1081
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,520
your best

1082
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,640
way to be able to move on let me show

1083
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
you though what it's accomplished for me

1084
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,480
you know i started out with linux for

1085
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,119
ladies and i got my rhca

1086
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,520
and i got a job at works at rackspace

1087
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,440
then i had the horrible moment with that

1088
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,480
ticket review

1089
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,720
and i decided i wanted to prove myself

1090
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,040
so i got my rhce

1091
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,839
then i realized i failed at being a

1092
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,280
linux admin i'm not

1093
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,200
saying bad things about me i just hated

1094
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,320
the job

1095
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,359
so i got that open back training job and

1096
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,640
i got my coa

1097
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,720
and it was one of the coolest

1098
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
experiences because they said hey

1099
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,960
why don't you go to sydney my first

1100
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,240
international trip

1101
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,680
and talk about what you were able to

1102
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,520
accomplish and how and that's really

1103
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,440
what started my job at speaking at

1104
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,560
conferences

1105
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
and while i was there i admitted my

1106
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,240
faults i admitted what i broke

1107
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,359
so i asked tons of questions and when it

1108
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,040
was time for reboot the mentorship

1109
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,520
program

1110
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,040
they called me up and they said hell

1111
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,960
elle why don't you take this

1112
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,119
and i said all right but i need mentors

1113
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,320
along the way

1114
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,560
one of those mentors was spots i asked

1115
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,640
her every openstack question you could

1116
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,839
ever get to

1117
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,280
so when there was a position open at

1118
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
linux academy who do you think she

1119
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,400
contacted

1120
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,320
i had a great time that's when i became

1121
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,000
a technical evangelist and i started

1122
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,119
traveling more

1123
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,440
the company saw that people were

1124
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,520
responding to my message about asking

1125
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
questions and they said don't worry

1126
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
about doing training

1127
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,440
anthony's actual job description for me

1128
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:03,839
was

1129
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,160
change the community one student's life

1130
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,599
at a time

1131
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,599
i asked about the study groups we

1132
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,119
started podcasting

1133
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,200
all of these had failures along the way

1134
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,599
they weren't perfect it's all about

1135
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,720
breaking it down and keep trying i can't

1136
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,560
tell you what the rest of the future

1137
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,800
brings for me i don't know and you know

1138
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,599
what

1139
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,359
i'm sitting here working on an archbox

1140
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,200
that's right here that i can't get to

1141
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,320
boot anymore

1142
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,000
but i'm actually excited about it i've

1143
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,240
never tried arch so

1144
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,960
here's hoping that it works alright guys

1145
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
thank you so much for learning this i

1146
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,560
promise i will eventually learn how to

1147
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
stop saying god is in a talk

1148
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,040

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,599
asking for job

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,839
you know resume interviews for people

1154
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,079
i've been asking for advice for people

1155
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,000
and that's because people are showing me

1156
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,320
their

1157
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,480
vulnerability and though i can't help

1158
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,560
them i know somebody in the community is

1159
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,599
going to

1160
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,640
so thanks for helping me and uh i am

1161
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,800
going to try to make this window small

1162
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,320
so i can look to see if there are any

1163
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,720
questions

1164
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,599
thank you so much that was awesome

1165
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,280
i really enjoyed that and inspired me

1166
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,880
and let me see we had one person asking

1167
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,640
