1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,960
thanks for the introduction welcome

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,439
everyone

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,880
i hope everyone's having a good time at

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,720
this virtual conference today

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,840
uh kudos and thanks to the staff and uh

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
stephen for putting this together and

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,480
running this

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,719
uh really great encouraging to see all

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,679
these

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,840
these uh conferences that have continued

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,320
even though virtual so this is awesome

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,119
and another great uh side effect is the

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,640
fact that people that normally couldn't

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,560
attend these are able to attend

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,119
people that geographically distanced

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,640
that could make it so this is an awesome

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,920
deal so it's really

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,000
been great this year be able to have so

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,160
much access to so many great conferences

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,559
online

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
so uh so

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
you heard a little bit about me so just

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
a little more detail on my background i

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,079
like to share this background because um

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,160
it kind of gives you an idea of how i

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,079
got into pen testing

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,920
and so you you know you can relate your

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,680
own path where you're at

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
and how that can relate into becoming a

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,359
pentester if that's something you're

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,480
interested in

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,959
so i've been in iit and infosec for over

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,479
22 years

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,799
i've been in infosec specifically since

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,320
2004

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
started out doing network security did

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,640
that for about a year and a half moved

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
into application security

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
and application security is where i

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,920
learned that i wanted to be a pen tester

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,960
i was using

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,520
web application vulnerability scanners

43
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,080
started

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
you know attending some different little

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,720
uh vendor talks on different tools and

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,159
really got interested in

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,920
in pen testing so in 2012 i got laid off

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,119
from my job

49
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,759
and i went to work as a pen tester so

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
i've been pen testing for a little over

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,159
eight years

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,600
the first five years was spinning

53
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
consulting if you ever get the chance to

54
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
consult that's a great way to get

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,799
a lot of experience really quick get

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,399
you know exposure to a lot of different

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,320
environments than you would in just one

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,960
place

59
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
so that's really molded and helped my

60
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
career a lot i'm also the co-host of the

61
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
uncommon journey podcast and this is a

62
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,079
podcast on

63
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,840
becoming you know we're getting into

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
information security and

65
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
i co-host this podcast with alyssa

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
miller and chloe mustaghi

67
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,080
it's a little more to my background just

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,599
to kind of show

69
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,520
if you're doubting that you or don't

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,959
think you can do this

71
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,800
you know i was a former meat head you

72
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,239
know power lifter

73
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,040
pro wrestler and never thought i'd ever

74
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,680
be paid to use my mind to think

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
so i started i was a pro wrestler after

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
high school

77
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
and then i had to find a more stable

78
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
career because i got married so i went

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
to trade school to become a dread

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
cad draftsman and during my drafting

81
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,840
career i found out about sysadmin work

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
i was working for a company and we were

83
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
billed like

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,239
out at they were built out twice of our

85
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,200
hourly

86
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
rate and then i noticed the sysadmin was

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,720
making about

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
10 would have worked out to be about ten

89
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,280
dollars an hour or more than what we

90
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,080
were making

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,519
and what they were doing seemed a lot

92
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,159
more interesting so i became a cis admin

93
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,760
did that for a little over six years

94
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,519
moved into information security and then

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,840
pen testing

96
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
and so this is a this is a slide i share

97
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,080
each semester with my ethical hacking

98
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
class my web app pin testing class

99
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
with great power comes great

100
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
responsibility

101
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,280
only hack if you have permission and

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
even better written permission

103
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
hacking without permission is illegal if

104
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
you get into legal

105
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,799
problems then that makes it hard to get

106
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,120
any kind of job development

107
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
i t security in general so you want to

108
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,720
really be careful

109
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,080
when you're doing any kind of hacking

110
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,840
make sure you have permission

111
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
uh this can be done practice wise

112
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,440
through ctfs or bug bounties

113
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
but make sure you have permission you

114
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,480
don't want it's not worth getting in

115
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,798
trouble

116
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,159
what is pen testing so pen testing is

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
assessing security from an adversarial

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,720
perspective

119
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to

120
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,920
get unauthorized access

121
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
to systems and sensitive data also known

122
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
as hacking

123
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
and some of the things i like to do here

124
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
too is people new to the community

125
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,280
people just getting started you know

126
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
make sure you differentiate between

127
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,439
hacker and cyber criminal there's a lot

128
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,200
of people in the industry that are in

129
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,879
that are offended by that and you know

130
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,040
starting off on the wrong foot by

131
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
labeling them

132
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,680
negatively is is a bad thing so just

133
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
remember that so and

134
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
keeping that in mind you know be able to

135
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
assess security from what an adversary

136
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,080
or a cyber criminal would would view is

137
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,040
a way to uncover

138
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,919
vulnerabilities that may not otherwise

139
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,759
be detected you may run a vulnerability

140
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,560
scan

141
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,759
but unless you're able to get on that

142
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,360
system you really don't truly understand

143
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
how vulnerable that system is

144
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
and exploitable vulnerabilities are

145
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
higher risk at a higher priority for

146
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,000
remediation

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
sometimes remediation these security

148
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,440
flaws

149
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
can be very expensive it could mean

150
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
replacing firewalls or adding

151
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
new software possibly adding new

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
security roles to the company so this

153
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
could be expensive

154
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
and an exploitable vulnerability is a

155
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,240
higher risk and more of a priority to

156
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
remediate

157
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
and so this a lot of times go into the

158
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,919
justification for budgeting new

159
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,680
new equipment and staff too so this is

160
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,639
why this is really important

161
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
also regulatory compliance pci dss the

162
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,360
payment card industry data security

163
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,320
standard

164
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,800
has driven a lot of pen testing over the

165
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
past several years i

166
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
used to work for a bank and we had like

167
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,960
a 13 person pen test team

168
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,039
and all of our pen testing was focused

169
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,479
on pci

170
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
that was the reason in the what

171
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
drove the pen test and the budgeting for

172
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
the staff for that size to perform

173
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,720
pentest

174
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
it's a fun job and there's a lot of

175
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,840
opportunities as pen testing

176
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,320
when i got started in 2012 most of the

177
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
pentest jobs were either contract or

178
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
consulting jobs

179
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,039
and so as pci and other

180
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,039
industry needs and compliance has come

181
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,560
along then there's been more opportunity

182
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
for jobs

183
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,720
if you have like 500 applications you

184
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
need tested for a company

185
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
and you go through a consulting company

186
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,759
you're going to spend a lot of money so

187
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,840
if you have your own internal staff

188
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,360
then that makes it a little more

189
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,919
affordable

190
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
in pen testing jobs when you're looking

191
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
for a pen testing job

192
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
you know the more professional terms you

193
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
know you've heard you've heard pentester

194
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
but penetration testers in the long

195
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,919
long-term

196
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,280
uh form of the name security consultants

197
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,639
analysts and engineers

198
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,000
so a lot of times you have to kind of

199
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
dig down into the description dot

200
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,919
job description sometimes to see if it's

201
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,199
a pen testing job

202
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,240
because a lot of times you're going to

203
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
see consultant or engineer

204
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
so other terms synonymous with pen

205
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,759
testing

206
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,960
is ethical hackers offensive security

207
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
adversarial security and threatened

208
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
vulnerability management is a popular

209
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,000
department where

210
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,759
some of these type of functions reside

211
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,840
under

212
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
there's other skills that pen testing is

213
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,639
important in so you may not be

214
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
pen testing may not be your goal maybe

215
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,599
this is interesting you want to learn

216
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,720
the skill

217
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
and maybe you you know you aspire to be

218
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,160
a pen tester

219
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
but these skills will help you as you're

220
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,199
learning along the way

221
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
if you're a sock analyst you're able to

222
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
understand malicious traffic better

223
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
same same with a security analyst

224
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
network security analyst and engineers

225
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
understanding that malicious traffic

226
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
digital forensics and incident response

227
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
this is important that you're able to

228
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,000
identify

229
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,400
malicious traffic and it helps you to to

230
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,479
investigate your your cases better if

231
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,759
you understand

232
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,360
the hacker mindset understand these

233
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,039
attacks

234
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
purple teams this is beginning to be

235
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,599
something pretty popular where

236
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,080
the red team offense and defense are

237
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,199
working together

238
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,560
to improve the defenses during pen tests

239
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
you can monitor the activity see if that

240
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,639
it's being detected and then you know

241
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,840
once you're finished go back

242
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
in and run some of these types of

243
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,319
attacks and tune your systems to make

244
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,199
sure they're

245
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
actually detecting that malicious

246
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
behavior

247
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,919
on the network also you know you're

248
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,680
testing the people

249
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
that are defending the network in

250
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
application security this is another

251
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,639
popular area

252
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,840
and one of the areas if you're wanting

253
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,759
to do pen testing the through bug

254
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
bounties it's a quick way to get

255
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,280
experience through working in production

256
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,800
applications in different types of

257
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
pentest targets it's not all

258
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,879
just cutting dry network you have your

259
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,400
wireless networks

260
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,680
and then when you're testing networks

261
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
you want to test it internally as well

262
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
as external

263
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,720
external is not only a threat sometimes

264
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
internal there was

265
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,039
there's been stats thrown around over

266
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,760
the years and i've seen

267
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,599
sometimes threats there are actually

268
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,559
internal can be up to 60 to 70 percent

269
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,360
of the time

270
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,039
not sure on the exact stats on that but

271
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,120
there are insider threats

272
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
you know there are people that will try

273
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,959
to steal intellectual property that are

274
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,240
actually hired

275
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
that'll get a job within the company to

276
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,279
go into the company to steal the

277
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
intellectual property so

278
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
the uh adversaries are internal as well

279
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,480
as

280
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,800
external and then wireless and external

281
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
this is you know

282
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
outside facing you know someone doesn't

283
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
have to be inside your building to

284
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,640
attack your

285
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
your network so these are very important

286
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,440
applications are very important because

287
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
you know a lot of the applications

288
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,480
before used to be thick clients sitting

289
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
on your desktop

290
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,120
while you still have your microsoft

291
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
office and those sort of tools a lot of

292
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
the applications have gone to web-based

293
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
because web-based is more mobile you can

294
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
run it on mobile devices

295
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
different operating systems and some you

296
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,120
know

297
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,720
kiosks and all sorts of things so it's a

298
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,600
lot more flexible application

299
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
that people are using so those are

300
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
there's a big need for testing that

301
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,720
as well as cloud and mobile applications

302
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,279
hardware

303
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,920
testing the routers and switches testing

304
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,120
products you know

305
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,959
right hard you know network hardware

306
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,640
products you know when they

307
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,120
create new routers and switches they

308
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,880
need to test the security on those that

309
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
way that any bugs can be

310
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
remediated before they're released out

311
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,399
into the public

312
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,959
iot is another popular area medical

313
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:01,519
devices

314
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,399
pacemakers and insulin pumps are

315
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,320
connected by bluetooth even

316
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
wi-fi i've done wireless pen tests

317
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,079
before where

318
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,680
for hospitals that i was going through

319
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
there doing my scans and i saw

320
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,920
you know medical devices showing up on

321
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,839
the wireless network as well as i've

322
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,279
done pen tests for

323
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,320
for manufacturers of medical devices

324
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
and just seeing those devices attached

325
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
to a network kind of gives you a little

326
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,079
you know kind of wears you a little bit

327
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,600
look kind of scares you of what the

328
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,120
possibilities could be you know these

329
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
are devices that

330
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,079
if taking down it can harm someone so

331
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,200
it's really important

332
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
that they're secured as well as

333
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
transportation

334
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
with the self-driving vehicles

335
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,560
on the horizon and soon to be out we

336
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
need to make sure those are secure

337
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
because if someone was able to take

338
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,560
control over a self-driving vehicle

339
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
you know they could cause a lot of harm

340
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,079
so we need to make sure that those are

341
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,200
secure

342
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
uh people in buildings you know you have

343
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,880
to make sure that the people that are

344
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
doing the job

345
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,240
of protecting your company whether

346
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,880
they're security or just people that are

347
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,560
just employees in different areas you

348
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
have to make sure you need to make sure

349
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,640
that they're

350
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,839
not letting people in the building

351
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
without proper access

352
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,160
and protecting your company so the way

353
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,240
you test that is the social engineering

354
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,560
you also test the building security like

355
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
through physical security testing

356
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
so these are a lot of times part of red

357
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,160
teaming activities

358
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,839
but these are all important areas that

359
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,360
need to be

360
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,920
tested and based on where you may start

361
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,560
out

362
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
is based on the experience you have if

363
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
you have experience in networking

364
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,279
then network pen testing may be the area

365
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,480
for you to go into

366
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,959
if you're a developer then application

367
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,320
pen testing is going to come

368
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
more easy for you as well as if you have

369
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,959
experience working with hardware you

370
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,360
know firmware and that kind of stuff so

371
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
work look in these different areas maybe

372
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,959
if the the

373
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,440
spot that you may want to focus on where

374
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
you want to start your career as a pen

375
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
tester

376
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,480
in types of pen testing knowledge when

377
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
you're doing a pen test

378
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
there's a amount of knowledge that the

379
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
tester has

380
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,959
you know the black box pen test is going

381
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,680
to be more similar to what an attacker

382
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,000
is going

383
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,480
to try to perform and it's important to

384
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,639
do this while the white box or crystal

385
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
box pen test

386
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
is is important as well maybe that

387
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
exterior is really tough to get into

388
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
but if someone was able to find some

389
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,639
someone's password

390
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,240
or you know brute force the password to

391
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,600
get into it then you need to be able to

392
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,040
test all the other

393
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
security controls so with application

394
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,079
pen tests you want to use

395
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,720
a account level for each level of access

396
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,800
thoroughly test that system

397
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
and a lot of these are based on the

398
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
amount of time you have if you have a

399
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
lot of time

400
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,079
then uh you can do black box that record

401
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,920
requires more reconnaissance more time

402
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,200
to test whereas

403
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,279
the white box of crystal blocks test

404
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
requires less time because you have more

405
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,720
knowledge of the system

406
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,279
you can have anything from like on top

407
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
of a couch you can have diagrams of the

408
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
network as well as documentation

409
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
about how the application is reading

410
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,240
written even source code

411
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,399
you know these are helpful in testing so

412
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,160
that provides a more thorough test

413
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,079
and grey box testing is kind of more

414
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,920
common of what you're going to see

415
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
as a pen tester it's kind of a cross

416
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
between the two methods

417
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
they give you enough information to be

418
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
able to test the application

419
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,519
or network well without giving you too

420
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,240
much or too

421
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
little so it's kind of a happy medium

422
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
between the two

423
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,959
and that can vary not everything is set

424
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,959
in stone there's not just those three

425
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,079
identical you know types of knowledge

426
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,279
you could do

427
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,440
you know it could be more defined or

428
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
less defined so there's a lot of

429
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,160
variance in there and it's going to

430
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
depend on the time

431
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,800
and different types of pen test steps

432
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
now these first two as you see the red

433
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,720
text it's not a pen test vulnerability

434
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,839
scans

435
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,760
is not a pen test this is running a

436
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,240
scanner to look for vulnerabilities

437
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
and this is actually part of a pen test

438
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
is running vulnerability scans and then

439
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
your vulnerability assessments is the

440
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,199
next step above

441
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,600
you run your vulnerability scans and

442
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,639
then you validate

443
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,920
those vulnerabilities to make sure

444
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
they're not false positives

445
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,760
and you can also run other tools during

446
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,519
this process to detect

447
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,800
vulnerabilities that maybe the

448
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,680
vulnerability scanner might have missed

449
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,720
and so the next step of these methods

450
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
is pin testing so basically you've done

451
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
your vulnerability scans we've validated

452
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,199
any of the vulnerabilities found any

453
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,279
extra vulnerabilities with other tools

454
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
so now we're going to go in and try to

455
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
exploit or hack any of the

456
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,240
vulnerabilities that we found that are

457
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,800
not false positives

458
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,240
once you get in that system you can see

459
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,839
if you can go further

460
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,279
and then you get into your red teaming

461
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,120
or adversarial tests

462
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,040
this is where you're testing the blue

463
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
team it's an attack simulation

464
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
less restrictive in scope usually so

465
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
that way you're able to go in

466
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,639
and test the reactions so you want to

467
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,680
make sure

468
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,320
that the ir team is seeing this activity

469
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
that your

470
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,399
ips ids is detecting this so you can

471
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,279
shut down any of those kind of

472
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,880
activities so it's a good way

473
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
a good exercise to test the test the

474
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,959
blue team

475
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,880
and different specializations so we kind

476
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
of covered some of the different targets

477
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,240
so some of these specializations there

478
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
are in in pen testing

479
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
most people are going to start out as a

480
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,519
generalist this is the way i started out

481
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
i did network pen testing

482
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
and eventually moved in shortly after

483
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,199
into wi-fi pin testing and then some

484
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,040
light web application

485
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,880
so even though it's a network pen test

486
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
you're going to find web-based

487
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,560
clients web-based servers and

488
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,320
in admin portals for different

489
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,839
administrative consoles

490
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,759
so there's so sometimes that may be your

491
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,600
only way in as a pen tester into the

492
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
network is through the web application

493
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,839
layer

494
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,680
and so there's applications web app

495
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,000
mobile thick client and cloud

496
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,519
and then social engineering a lot of

497
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,639
people there's some people that will

498
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,920
specialize

499
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
in social engineering dealing with you

500
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,360
know physical and

501
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
security and and social engineering

502
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,279
people i've known people who got their

503
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
start that had no

504
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
technical background but they were

505
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,240
really good at

506
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
talking to people had really good people

507
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,279
skills and were good at social

508
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,639
engineering so that was a way for them

509
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,360
to start

510
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,880
so that's a place for someone to start a

511
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,720
lot of people just seem to be drawn

512
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,600
to that area it seems more fun a little

513
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
more thrilling to do so

514
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,680
that's kind of an interesting area and

515
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,199
gets a lot of interest from people

516
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,440
wanting to break in

517
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,639
and then transportation there's

518
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,399
companies a lot of the automobile

519
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,399
industries they've got people to test

520
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,360
their

521
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,079
their vehicles and then red team the

522
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,040
adversarial

523
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
simulation and sometimes people just

524
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,959
don't jump right into this

525
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,160
it may be someone that's worked in

526
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,399
social engineering have worked as a

527
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
generalist

528
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
this some light web application is good

529
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,880
here but a lot of your skills there

530
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,800
is going to be more focused on your your

531
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,399
network pen testing

532
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,399
as well as your social engineering

533
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,120
and how to become a pen tester this is

534
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,680
usually the

535
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
reason people attend this talk they're

536
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
wanting to get into pen testing

537
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,919
so you need to understand the technology

538
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,919
before you can secure it or break into

539
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,559
it

540
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,359
so you really need to know networking

541
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,480
operating systems

542
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
at a sysadmin level meaning you can go

543
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,679
into windows

544
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,480
you can disable the network adapter

545
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,640
connect to networks make configuration

546
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,839
changes

547
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,240
because if you get access to the system

548
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,760
as a pen tester you want to see what

549
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
else you can do if you've only got like

550
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
a shell

551
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,720
or command line access if you know the

552
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,880
command line of that operating system

553
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
you can shut down firewalls or services

554
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,000
depending on

555
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
your level of access to that system so

556
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
you really need to know those operating

557
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
systems otherwise you'll spend a lot of

558
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,360
time

559
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
on google trying to figure that as you

560
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,799
go and you need that base knowledge so

561
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,520
you can

562
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,919
utilize your time better and then

563
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,440
understanding security because

564
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,200
understanding security makes it easier

565
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,760
to break into

566
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,919
and then application and hardware other

567
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,600
helpful areas to know

568
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,559
as a pen tester

569
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,440
and so you're so if you have your

570
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
technology knowledge then the next thing

571
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,640
you got to do is you got to learn to

572
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,039
hack

573
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,640
and this is kind of where the point i

574
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
was at when i became a pen tester

575
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,679
i had done vulnerability scans network

576
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,520
as well as web application

577
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,360
so i needed to learn how to hack so i

578
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
started my job

579
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
and i signed up for the oscp

580
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
certification

581
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,679
course and that's one of the courses

582
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,120
i've learned the most about pentesting

583
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,240
because you really learned

584
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
how to hack in that course and so it

585
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,799
really helped help me in my career

586
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,440
and conferences classes you know like

587
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,799
these conferences you know we have

588
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,080
workshops here

589
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,160
in different talks on the subject going

590
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,600
to meetings and meetups your local

591
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
defcon groups your

592
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,960
your hacker associations and stuff

593
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
that's a good way to get in

594
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
and learn about the different types of

595
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,360
techniques and the more

596
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,760
views and ideas of pen testing you get

597
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,120
and hacking the better

598
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,480
because everyone does it a little bit

599
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,559
different and so

600
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,160
someone may explain something that

601
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,600
clicks with you better sometimes it's a

602
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,039
matter of seeing this

603
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,000
topic more than once to really get it

604
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,360
self-study

605
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,600
home labs are great everyone should have

606
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
a home lab

607
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,080
there's a lot of good videos out there

608
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,320
on youtube

609
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,679
there's different tutorials that you can

610
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,440
follow for self-study

611
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,919
blogs articles and twitter and towards

612
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,880
the end of this we're gonna

613
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
we'll cover some different resources in

614
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,200
these areas that'll help you and your

615
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,679
your studies to become a pen tester but

616
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,360
twitter is a great place to get

617
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,799
information you're gonna find out about

618
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,480
all the latest conferences where you can

619
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,440
learn

620
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
hacking techniques and pen testing so

621
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,559
that's a really good

622
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,640
great resource a lot of good people to

623
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,280
follow there too

624
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,360
and so to become a pen tester you really

625
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,720
need the hacker mindset

626
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
and so the hacker mindset is the ability

627
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
to think like a hacker

628
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,840
be able to find ways and vulnerabilities

629
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
into the system

630
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
the hacker mindset is is kind of a

631
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,919
combination

632
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,039
of creativity and analytical thinking

633
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,600
and so this is like one of the areas

634
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,679
there's other areas in i.t and security

635
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,360
that are creative but this is one area

636
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,320
that really

637
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,200
calls upon your your creativity and so

638
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,039
developing the hacker mindset is similar

639
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,480
to troubleshooting

640
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
you know the first time you install

641
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,280
windows or linux and if it goes perfect

642
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,799
that's fine but then once you start

643
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,039
having problems connecting the network

644
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,880
or you install linux or windows another

645
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,960
time and it doesn't go just right

646
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
then you have to troubleshoot it and you

647
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,480
learn so much from troubleshooting

648
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
and just kind of like hacking you when

649
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,720
you try something that doesn't work

650
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
then you know other directions to go

651
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,480
other things to try and continue your

652
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
research and continue to enumerate the

653
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,200
system

654
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,240
performing more recon so

655
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
and then along the way you'll learn

656
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
different hacks and so you'll identify

657
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,960
okay this this is a java server

658
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,240
you're able to upload uh a shell to it

659
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,799
you know a malicious file to create a

660
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,400
shell and get access to system so you

661
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,880
kind of

662
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
learn the different types of attacks and

663
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
put those together

664
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
and the best way to develop this is the

665
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
repetition and hands-on

666
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,640
hands-on hacking experience ctfs

667
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,799
bug bounties home labs just practicing

668
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,559
that and you just kind of build this

669
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,320
base level of knowledge that

670
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,760
after a while there's just things that

671
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
you just built you're able to know

672
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,280
how to do without referring to your

673
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,679
notes it's good to keep notes but you

674
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,640
once you

675
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
like any area of i t you know you know

676
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
how to connect to the network

677
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,799
you know how to set up apache web server

678
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,159
these different things once you

679
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,679
know those a little better then you're

680
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
able to get your testing better you're

681
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,039
building up that base knowledge

682
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,480
and able to function better as a pen

683
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
tester

684
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
and so the pen tester blueprint formula

685
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,799
is technology knowledge

686
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,640
plus security knowledge plus the hacker

687
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
mindset so these are the items that you

688
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,159
need to be

689
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,320
successful as a pen tester and this

690
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,840
takes time and one of the things i want

691
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,400
to tell

692
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440
anyone getting into this be patient give

693
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,320
yourself time

694
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,960
hacking wasn't easy for me to learn it

695
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,559
took some time to learn it

696
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,720
so it takes time so give yourself you

697
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,760
know

698
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,559
time and be patient don't try to rush it

699
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,080
and take your time as you learn you'll

700
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,960
better absorb

701
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,880
and remember things if you take your

702
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,159
time

703
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,200
don't try to rush through it

704
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,120
so where do you start so you want to div

705
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
you need to develop a plan so you kind

706
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
of you're going to do a gap analysis

707
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,559
on what you know and what you need to

708
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,720
know so we've discussed that you need

709
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
technology knowledge you need

710
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,480
to understand the technologies the

711
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,799
security as well as the hacker mindset

712
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,320
so we need to fill in those gaps

713
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,840
some examples here if you have no i.t

714
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,880
experience then start learning

715
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
the basics the operating systems

716
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,080
hardware and networking

717
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
a good place to start here is look at

718
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,559
like your a plus certification type

719
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,679
material

720
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,039
not saying that you have to get the a

721
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,039
plus certification but there's videos

722
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,000
out there like professor

723
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,240
messer that you can go through learn the

724
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,880
operating systems learn basic networking

725
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,440
and then progress into like network plus

726
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,640
type materials

727
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,039
or even like the ccna learn your

728
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,320
networking

729
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,799
and then you know if you're you've got

730
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,760
it experienced

731
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
fill in those gaps of things that you're

732
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
you don't have experience with

733
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,000
if you're a a help desk person you may

734
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,440
not be dealing with linux much so learn

735
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,400
linux

736
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
learn security and networking so just

737
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
fill in those gaps that you don't that

738
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,720
you don't know

739
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,600
an infosec experience same there you you

740
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
may be to a level

741
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
that you're understanding linux

742
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
understanding networking but you got to

743
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
get the hacking down

744
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,360
so ctfs and bug bounties and labs and my

745
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,320
my advice for everyone is build a home

746
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,640
lab

747
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,600
even if you're an experienced pen tester

748
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:41,840
i

749
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,640
t person security analyst having a home

750
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,480
lab is good even as a pen tester we have

751
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
labs set up that we can test our proof

752
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,760
of concept codes

753
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,679
if we have some exploit we want to

754
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
perform on a vulnerability we found on

755
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,840
the network or something new comes out

756
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,120
we want to test that ahead of time

757
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,520
because sometimes exploits can have

758
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,559
adverse

759
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,880
reaction effects on a network so you can

760
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,720
crash a system so you want to test it

761
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,520
first

762
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,039
and work out any kind of bug so this is

763
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,960
good and it's way to learn techniques

764
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,480
because you may not run across all these

765
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
scenarios in a pen test

766
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,960
so having a lab you're able to test all

767
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,480
the newest latest attacks

768
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,760
in your home lab

769
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,080
and then your labs so i kind of

770
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,200
categorize this

771
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,679
and this can vary the minimalist lab is

772
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,440
one of my favorites

773
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
and this is just having virtualized

774
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,799
hosts on your

775
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,760
your laptop or your desktop computer so

776
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,559
you're running

777
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,640
a virtual machine with uh kali linux

778
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,760
or and then your attack platforms the

779
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,600
vulnerable vms that you want to attack

780
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,520
and then you have your dedicated labs

781
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,640
where you can have

782
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
like separate systems you can have like

783
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,400
a one computer with just your vulnerable

784
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,279
vms on it

785
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
and you can get more advanced you can

786
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,200
have separate servers

787
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,120
you know you can hook up some raspberry

788
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
pi's to your network for your

789
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,440
like client computers or little servers

790
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,159
uh

791
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
you can set up routers and switches even

792
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,000
wireless networks so you can

793
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
build it as complex as you want to and

794
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,000
that's a good way to learn

795
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,159
learn these uh technologies but keep in

796
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,600
mind also too

797
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,679
the more complex you build it the more

798
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,880
troubleshooting

799
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
you may have to spend when you're

800
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,840
working your lab if something doesn't

801
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,919
work right then you have to go back and

802
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,080
and fix that so keep that in mind as

803
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,960
you're building your lab

804
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,159
and i personally have a small server

805
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,159
that i built with vms on it as well as i

806
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:32,960
run

807
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,679
some vulnerable vms on my laptop and so

808
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,400
your home tech

809
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,320
lab attack platform so you have to have

810
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,159
something that your tools are on that

811
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,360
you're hacking with

812
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,400
and so kali linux is my my top

813
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
choice and parrot os is a good uh

814
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
operating system as well for linux i

815
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
recently used that for the first time i

816
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,120
did a wireless pen test

817
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,279
cali linux wasn't working out so well

818
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,440
with the drivers for some of my

819
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,159
network cards that i was using and some

820
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,840
of the tools just with the newer version

821
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
of kali linux

822
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,000
some of the updates trying to use some

823
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
of the wireless tools just didn't work

824
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,400
right

825
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,960
and paired os everything worked like a

826
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,840
champ

827
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,679
and i was able to install other tools

828
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,679
pretty easily and ubuntu is another

829
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,480
route to go

830
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
you can use the pentester framework

831
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,159
scripts from trustedsec

832
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,159
and install all the pen testing tools on

833
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,159
there and run it from that perspective

834
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,440
and then there's also your windows

835
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,559
option windows 10 with the commando

836
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,760
vm scripts it runs some automated

837
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,799
scripts similar to

838
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,200
what the pen tester framework does but

839
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,640
this installs the

840
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,039
pen testing and hacking tools on windows

841
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,120
and it also sets up security so

842
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
windows defender doesn't go in and

843
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,279
delete your pen testing tools

844
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,200
and exploit code from your system so it

845
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,799
sets the security up for

846
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,840
free there so that's a nice added

847
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,720
feature

848
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
as your pen testing platform i recommend

849
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,919
even like from a

850
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
professional perspective i like to have

851
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
like either a

852
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,760
a intel based system that i'm running

853
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,679
ubuntu as my host os

854
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,600
or mac os with vms on that

855
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,720
or windows and i will run like a a

856
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,799
windows vm for the windows tools

857
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,240
as well as a linux vm so it's good to

858
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,600
get the experience with the windows

859
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,559
tools

860
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,159
linux i mean the experience with windows

861
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,600
tools because the linux stuff is very

862
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
popular but it's good to learn

863
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,880
the windows stuff because there's some

864
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
tools there that can that are very

865
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,440
helpful on a pen test

866
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,640
and home lab targets so you can create

867
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,600
virtual machines

868
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
there's a lot of targets on vault hub

869
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,320
that you can download a lot of ctfs will

870
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
will upload their their the vms of their

871
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,200
ctfs so you have those to play around

872
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,840
with

873
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,520
as well as there's metasploitable two

874
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
and three these are two

875
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,000
vms i highly recommend starting out with

876
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,039
they're really dense with

877
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,520
vulnerabilities that you can exploit

878
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,320
to get the same similar

879
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,919
benefits from other vms you may have to

880
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,320
install multiple vms or vulnerable

881
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,399
applications to get the same amount of

882
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,720
targets but with metasploitable 2 you

883
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,399
have a lot of vulnerability so one of

884
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,440
those vms

885
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,520
can keep you busy for a while and

886
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,120
there's a lot of walkthroughs on those

887
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
two vms

888
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,000
that you can go through and learn how to

889
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,279
pen test you can

890
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,799
look at the different walkthroughs and

891
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,880
compare how other people are doing it

892
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,399
differently and pick up some helpful

893
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,440
techniques

894
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,720
and then a wasp web goat as well as uh

895
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,480
juice shop and several other vulnerable

896
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,399
vms that you can find

897
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,279
on owasp.org's website are great and you

898
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,880
can build your own vm targets

899
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,960
go to exploitdb download the vulnerable

900
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,159
software

901
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,520
build your own targets at home just like

902
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,679
testing your proof of concept code some

903
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,360
new vulnerability comes out

904
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,960
and maybe it's been patched then you can

905
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,559
go back and get vulnerable versions of

906
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,600
the software

907
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,279
and set that up in your home lab to test

908
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,880
it

909
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,399
then of course like your your

910
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,520
different vulnerable vms like hack the

911
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,760
box and try hack me are good options as

912
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,000
well

913
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,000
and some recommended reading here so uh

914
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
the first semester of or actually the

915
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,600
first year i taught the ethical hacking

916
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,480
class

917
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,399
i used the book penetration testing a

918
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,640
hands-on introduction to hacking

919
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,480
by georgia whitman this is a great book

920
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
for anyone starting out

921
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,520
it takes you through setting up your own

922
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,640
home lab so you can go through and

923
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,919
set up your lab this was really great

924
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,039
book for anyone's

925
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,840
going through the oscp they cover a lot

926
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,679
of topics there that are helpful

927
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,279
in preparing for the oscp and the next

928
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,480
book i'd recommend

929
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
or the next books would be the hacker

930
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
playbook two and three

931
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,960
and don't skip version two because

932
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,159
version

933
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,480
three gets more into red teaming which

934
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,159
is good but you don't want to miss out

935
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,360
on the items in the hacker playbook too

936
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
so the hack the first book the

937
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,679
penetration testing hands-on

938
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
introduction to hacking will help you

939
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,880
build a base

940
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,760
and the hacker's playbooks will help you

941
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,360
you hone your skills and and

942
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,520
improve your your pen testing skills

943
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,760
with that then the hacker's playbook

944
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,080
exploiting discovering exploiting flaws

945
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,360
security flaws

946
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,240
is a great book created by one of the

947
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,080
creators of burp suite so this is a

948
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,840
really good book for web application pen

949
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,000
testing

950
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,520
and the red team field manual that's

951
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
that's another good book

952
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,440
that's filled with a lot of different

953
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,279
command lines for

954
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,159
linux windows powershell a lot of

955
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:32,640
different

956
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,880
admin related functions and there's

957
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,039
another book out that i

958
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,880
didn't put on i forgot to update this

959
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,600
slide but another book that

960
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,360
i recommend getting this is good for

961
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,919
anyone blue team or red team

962
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,440
uh pen testers but the

963
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,320
the operation operator handbook this is

964
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,120
a good book

965
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,159
uh it's a lot thicker than the red team

966
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,200
field manual

967
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
this covers anything from like

968
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,559
kubernetes

969
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,360
uh gets into a lot of advanced

970
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,880
networking stuff so this is a really

971
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,519
great resource to have

972
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,200
and it's available in ebook format

973
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,519
whereas the red team field manual

974
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,159
is only in a printed format

975
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,320
and here's some learning resources so

976
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,480
i've got these divided out by paid and

977
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,159
free resources

978
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,480
and if you look at the top section i

979
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,519
start these by

980
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,240
from most expensive to least expensive

981
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,279
sans institute

982
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,039
if you're these are usually courses that

983
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,200
if your company's paying for your

984
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
training that's great there's 7 200

985
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,919
courses typically for a six day course

986
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,039
they've got some other ones that are

987
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,559
like two days long

988
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,640
like the red team course that are like

989
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,600
thirty eight hundred dollars they're

990
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
less expensive

991
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,000
but then you get to your elearn security

992
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,760
these are like from a thousand

993
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,000
to like thirteen fourteen hundred

994
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
dollars per club

995
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,200
per class it's really good defensive

996
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,480
security

997
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,320
they have a lot of advanced pen testing

998
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,679
related uh

999
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,760
courses there like the oscp that's a

1000
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,720
good one

1001
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,480
and then virtual hacking labs that's

1002
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,080
like 750

1003
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,559
for a year's worth of access to this

1004
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,600
hacking lab

1005
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,360
and it has an online course with it

1006
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,760
that's a good one to prep for the oscp

1007
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,200
and then you have pentester academy

1008
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,880
pentester academy

1009
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,679
has a large library of pen testing

1010
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,919
videos covering anything from

1011
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,279
mobile to wireless to javascript for pen

1012
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,720
testers

1013
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,159
python for pen testers different uh

1014
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,760
topics related to wireshark t-shark

1015
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,840
some light forensic stuff active

1016
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,000
directory security and hacking

1017
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,399
and then there's pentester lab this one

1018
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,360
focuses more

1019
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,640
on web application pen testing but where

1020
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,720
they differ from some of the other

1021
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,200
the other resources are that they go

1022
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,320
into

1023
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,919
types of exploits that will get you

1024
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,840
command line access that you're able to

1025
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
actually hack the system and not just

1026
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,080
discovered vulnerabilities and that

1027
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,960
one's pretty

1028
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,559
pretty cost effective in a really good

1029
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,000
course you can build a lot of

1030
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,760
linux security skills from that course

1031
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,120
they teach you how

1032
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,640
you can exploit the different uh

1033
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,120
unix linux vulnerabilities and then

1034
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,640
practical pentest labs

1035
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,720
is 64 for lifetime access it's mainly a

1036
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,519
linux based

1037
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,720
lab you access it through vpn

1038
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,360
and they've got like a short little pdf

1039
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,440
course showing you how to do port scans

1040
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,720
and stuff to get started

1041
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,360
so that's a very cost effective uh

1042
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,399
resource

1043
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,919
and i kind of played around with that

1044
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,320
it's a lot of fun and

1045
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,399
good to have and then you get into we're

1046
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,399
getting into our free resources

1047
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,600
uh bug crowd university and hacker one

1048
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,640
these are bug bug bounty resources uh

1049
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,840
they have videos

1050
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,320
as well as different tutorials and stuff

1051
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,120
hacker one has an online ctf

1052
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,919
and they actually you go through the ctf

1053
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,760
and the training modules to learn how to

1054
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,000
do web application pen testing which

1055
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,960
helps you

1056
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,600
in turn be a bug bounty hunter and those

1057
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,720
skills can also be used as a pen tester

1058
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
sans has a really good blog the sans pen

1059
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,079
testing

1060
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,960
blog there's uh different cheat sheets

1061
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,440
on different tools and techniques

1062
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,399
out there so this is a really good

1063
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,119
resource and hackingtutorials.org

1064
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,960
this is from the creators of the virtual

1065
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,119
hacking labs that i mentioned

1066
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,359
on the above part of the slide and this

1067
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,119
is tutorials related to nmap

1068
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,359
metasploit different types of exploits

1069
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,560
out there so it's a really good free

1070
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,359
resource

1071
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,399
for learning and then cyborg.it

1072
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,320
has some free resources some paid but

1073
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
there's a lot of good

1074
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,918
uh free materials out there on pen

1075
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,119
testing

1076
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,040
and then web security academy from the

1077
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,719
creators of the web application

1078
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,839
hackers handbook and burp suite the web

1079
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,440
web security academy out there in

1080
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,879
portswigger

1081
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,599
has a lot of learning materials they

1082
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,719
have

1083
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,199
learning content plus online labs that

1084
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,239
are completely free

1085
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,800
so it's a really good place to learn and

1086
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,960
then owasp the wasp website

1087
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,599
the creators of the owasp top 10.

1088
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,680
there's the owasp testing guide

1089
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
for web app pen testing as well as

1090
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,800
testing guides

1091
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,760
and recommendations for mobile and iot

1092
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,560
and then hack the box.eu

1093
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
is another good place there's some good

1094
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,000
vms on there tj null

1095
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,880
recommends some vms on there for

1096
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,640
preparing for the oscp

1097
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,800
and then over the wire ctf as well as

1098
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,560
under the wire ctf

1099
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,359
over the wire is more linux based and

1100
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,040
then under the wire is more

1101
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,359
windows based and power and powershell

1102
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,880
based so those are really good

1103
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,480
and to find these resources if you go to

1104
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,200
my website the hackermaker.com

1105
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,839
learning dash resources there's a link

1106
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,720
to this page with links to the resources

1107
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,040
so you can check that out if you don't

1108
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,560
have the

1109
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,520
screenshot of the slide

1110
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
in different certifications this is a

1111
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,040
question i get a lot

1112
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,560
you know uh what got me into

1113
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,640
teaching and doing conference stuff

1114
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,920
workshops and all that was

1115
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
originally just sharing information with

1116
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,119
people i really like that

1117
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,680
teaching and conference is a way to do

1118
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,800
that on a bigger scale

1119
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,119
so the question you always get is you

1120
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,560
know do i need certifications

1121
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,040
and which certifications do i need to

1122
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,320
get your foot in the door it's very

1123
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,839
helpful to have a certification

1124
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,200
because sometimes it can really be

1125
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,119
difficult to get that first interview

1126
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,200
if you really understand and know it

1127
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,400
then you could possibly get through the

1128
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,760
interview but just getting your foot in

1129
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,359
the door can be difficult

1130
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,839
so things like the ceh and pentest plus

1131
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,119
you know could possibly get you

1132
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,599
interviews because hr

1133
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,400
and hiring managers are really familiar

1134
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
with the the ceh

1135
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,400
but to get into your certifications that

1136
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
are going to help you

1137
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,800
from a standpoint of the knowledge

1138
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,720
you're gaining from that

1139
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,440
and and looked at by a lot of hiring

1140
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,960
managers are your

1141
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,040
your sans g pin cert your oscp

1142
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,320
your gxpn by sans and the osce

1143
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
these are pretty similar certs between

1144
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
the sans and offensive security

1145
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,079
although with offensive security you

1146
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,680
actually have to perform pen test you

1147
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,520
actually have to hack into systems

1148
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,320
to pass the exam whereas the sans

1149
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,839
certifications

1150
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,880
are more question and answer

1151
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,240
they'll give you items to be able to say

1152
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,800
what is this nmap scan do or whatever

1153
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,240
that that type of stuff it's good

1154
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,359
information

1155
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,640
and uh and very helpful for

1156
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,680
getting employment but like my oscp

1157
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,480
i've gotten out of the hands-on portion

1158
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,240
technical portions of interviews before

1159
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,960
because

1160
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
the hiring manager or the person who

1161
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,480
recommended me said you know

1162
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,520
he was able to pass the oscp he's able

1163
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,440
to do our lab so it's it's a

1164
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,240
the oscp is has given me a lot of

1165
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,119
mileage as far

1166
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,200
in my pen test career and that you know

1167
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
this and then the other one you know the

1168
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,000
difference between you know

1169
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,760
the we have the intermediate

1170
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,280
intermediate and advanced and these are

1171
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,560
these are all good to have one thing

1172
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,160
i'll say too is while you're preparing

1173
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,920
for these certifications

1174
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,200
learn the topics the ones like the

1175
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,320
you know your ceh or pentest plus where

1176
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
you're not actually having to do

1177
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,040
a pen test or stuff or hack things you

1178
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,240
need to make sure to learn it because

1179
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,280
when you go through the interview you're

1180
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,480
going to need to be able to answer the

1181
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,599

although their their certifications are

1193
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,720
starting to gain

1194
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,200
more uh notoriety people are starting to

1195
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,640
become familiar with it

1196
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,240
it's really good and i can tell you as

1197
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,800
far as taking those certification

1198
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,160
courses

1199
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,520
to learn how to pen test they're really

1200
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,800
good you'll learn how to pen test

1201
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,320
because you have to perform a pen test

1202
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,680
and write a report

1203
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,560
so those are very very valuable although

1204
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,280
not as

1205
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,040
quite sought out yet i think that'll

1206
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,359
change as popularity catches on

1207
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,119

and interview tips so when you're

1271
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,880
getting ready for interview prepare for

1272
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,079
your interview

1273
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,800
even as an experienced infrastruct

1274
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,319
person and pen tester

1275
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,319
i find that i do better on interviews if

1276
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,520
i prepare for it there may be some

1277
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,200
thing that you're not touching or you

1278
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,040
haven't worked with in that

1279
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,200
in the current job you're in in a while

1280
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
so sometimes go back and review

1281
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
review those topics uh the oau's top 10

1282
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,800
pen testers are always asked these

1283
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,319
questions their interviews

1284
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,359
cross-site scripting sql injection or

1285
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,079
two of the most

1286
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,599
popular items you're going to be

1287
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,520
questioned on during a pen test

1288
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,119
interview so understanding those

1289
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,960
vulnerabilities

1290
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,839
not just memorizing understand the

1291
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,040
vulnerabilities the different variations

1292
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,720
and types like sql injection you want to

1293
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,520
make sure

1294
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
you understand blind sql injection

1295
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,359
time-based sql ejection

1296
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,040
cross-site scripting your stored and

1297
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,520
reflected cross-site scripting

1298
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,359
understand those and how to remediate

1299
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,880
those because those are the questions

1300
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,839
i'm going to answer you

1301
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,760
ask you so really go over to know that

1302
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,200
and knowing that oh watch top 10 is

1303
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
going to help you a lot in your career

1304
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,720
and then some of the stuff that's that

1305
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,040
you wouldn't expect to get asked like

1306
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,000
the basics like 3-way tcp handshake or

1307
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,440
osi model

1308
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,720
people that are more experienced in

1309
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,880
management that may have been away from

1310
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,319
things for a while they don't

1311
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,400
they may not be as technical and may not

1312
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,079
ask some of the more current type

1313
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,359
questions so they're going to ask you

1314
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,040
stuff about the osi model

1315
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,280
in a three-way tcp handshake this is

1316
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,079
kind of

1317
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,200
you know basic stuff you know it101 that

1318
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,480
they expect you to know so

1319
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,319
kind of know those when you're going to

1320
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,640
the interview that'll go a long way

1321
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,040
one of my last job interviews i had the

1322
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
director asked me questions on the osi

1323
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,839
model

1324
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,560
and tcp handshake during my interview so

1325
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,839
not a lot of times those aren't

1326
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,119
technical interviews but they will throw

1327
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,680
in some

1328
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,280
some technical questions to get a better

1329
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,119
idea of you know your skill set

1330
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,040

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,200
professionals on there that have pen

1348
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,560
testing background

1349
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,119
blue team background we've got people

1350
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,720
thread hunting experience

1351
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,880
so it's a really good place to network

1352
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,000
and share ideas and get information

1353
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,400
and i i teach ethical hacking classes

1354
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,160
and web app testing classes originally

1355
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,920
college which recently

1356
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,839

number of questions that are coming from

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,720
the track three uh

1389
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,119
discord channel so if you don't if you

1390
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,480
don't mind i'd go ahead and just start

1391
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,440
those off for you

1392
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,520
uh what about documentation during an

1393
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,680
event um the hardest part for me is

1394
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,359
writing the report is there a template

1395
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,280
that you find helpful to leverage

1396
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,200
maybe a punch list you use of all the

1397
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
things you cover

1398
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,280
yeah what what i recommend is looking at

1399
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,960
when you look at stuff like the p-test

1400
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,160
standard

1401
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,760
they kind of show you things that you

1402
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,079
need to do during your pen test

1403
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,800
and as far as documenting that a great

1404
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,599
resource

1405
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,839
is tradis they have dratis has a

1406
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,000
community edition

1407
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,920
of their software and it's a report

1408
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,079
writing and collaboration tool

1409
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,920
and i believe it's if it's not installed

1410
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,000
by default on kali linux

1411
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,200
it's in the the kali linux repository so

1412
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,680
you just

1413
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,680
can do like an apt install uh dratis

1414
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,599
you know install that but what dredis

1415
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,400
does is not only does it

1416
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
collaborate it's a report generating

1417
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,200
tool and it also has like a checklist

1418
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,680
so you can define your pen testing

1419
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,880
methodology

1420
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,760
and it creates your checklist so i've

1421
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,440
used the pro version before and it works

1422
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,240
great

1423
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,319
and the community edition also has this

1424
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,400
checklist so you can choose the p-test

1425
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,000
standard for your typical

1426
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,880
pen test and you will select on what

1427
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,480
portion of the pen test and it'll show

1428
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,000
you different things to try for the type

1429
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,280
of pen test you're doing

1430
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,119
so it's kind of a good reminder and a

1431
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,400
checklist

1432
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,359
and aside from the report generating

1433
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,880
functions because there's not a lot of

1434
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,640
it's hard to find a good report template

1435
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,960
out there but this will let you track

1436
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,359
your

1437
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,599
your pen test as you're going along you

1438
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,760
upload your nmap scans to it

1439
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,400
you upload your nessus scans burp suite

1440
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,920
and then you create a report out of it

1441
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,119
it takes all that information and

1442
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,960
generates a report for you

1443
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,720
so this is a way to keep track of your

1444
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,400
pen test

1445
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,800
and also note taking you use something

1446
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,160
like joplin

1447
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,560
evernote keep note onenote one of these

1448
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,839
note-taking tools

1449
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,400
and as you're pen testing go through and

1450
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,280
attach your

1451
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,000
ness's output or take screenshots take

1452
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
your screenshots as you're going along

1453
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,040
if you exploit a system it may not be

1454
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,800
exploitable next time you may have ran

1455
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,960
it sometimes the exploits does something

1456
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,920
to the tcp

1457
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,560
ports that you're not able to do that

1458
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,680
exploit again

1459
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,359
so as you're going make sure you're

1460
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,280
taking notes so that way you remember

1461
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,560
how you exploited it

1462
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,160
take your screenshots your notes and

1463
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,240
populate that notebook that note taking

1464
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,119
tool

1465
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,599
create a node for each ip address or

1466
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,520
even group of ips that you run your map

1467
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,640
scans again

1468
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,839
take the output of each one of your

1469
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,040
tools that way you can refer back to it

1470
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,599
to look for you know exploits you can

1471
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,800
use against those vulnerabilities as

1472
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,079
well as when you write your report

1473
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:30,559
you've got

1474
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,040
screenshots there you've got output from

1475
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,680
nmap

1476
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,040
all your evidence there so when you go

1477
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,960
to build your report you've got a

1478
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,640
nice neatly organized another question

1479
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,599
from our channel

1480
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,760
do you feel that the news and others

1481
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,119
have maligned

1482
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,520
the term hacker i noticed that you used

1483
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,599
the term cybercriminal appropriately and

1484
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,520
would like your thoughts on this

1485
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,359
yes it's it's exactly the media and

1486
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,800
that's where it came from

1487
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,680
so most people that know the story of

1488
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,760
hackers back when

1489
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,160
you know hacking at one time the hacker

1490
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,599
term was really people

1491
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,119
if you think about the hackerspace

1492
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,440
makerspace where people are building

1493
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,160
things

1494
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
or trying to modify technology to

1495
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,280
different different things

1496
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,359
that's where hacking came from in the

1497
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,640
media the news

1498
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,240
would refer to cyber criminals as

1499
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
hackers so that's how it got

1500
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,920
coined is that way so we like to make

1501
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,680
sure you know because it's even

1502
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,760
locksmiths know how to break into a

1503
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,720
house

1504
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,000
but they do it ethically so

1505
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,319
as a security professionals we need to

1506
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,280
kind of help

1507
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,040
try to correct the mindset that way

1508
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,559
people separate it you know

1509
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,640
because it kind of gives us makes us

1510
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,319
look bad and and trying to build the

1511
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,200
trust

1512
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,280
you know media has made hackers sound

1513
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,119
bad so so definitely it's

1514
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,440
been the news that his coin that's where

1515
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,480
the where

1516
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,119
you know cyber criminals got the tag

1517
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,280
from

1518
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,160
um another uh post from inside of our

1519
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,720
channel

1520
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,160
uh one of the uh attendees is asking

1521
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,960
uh the guy that has cea certification

1522
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,720
after the training he is the pressure

1523
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,520
for the job

1524
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,599
uh and he would not know where to fly

1525
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,200
and how to apply

1526
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,040
how can he enter into the field of cyber

1527
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,680
security if he is a

1528
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,960
newbie without much experience

1529
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,440
well one of the things i'd recommend is

1530
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,200
try is do bug bounties

1531
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,720
and and ctfs uh that way you're gonna

1532
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,760
get the experience

1533
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,880
network go to different meetups and

1534
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,319
connect with people online because

1535
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,160
people try to help you out there but

1536
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,559
uh is trying to get connect sometimes if

1537
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,359
you're

1538
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,599
you may have to take a job in i.t or

1539
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,680
security and then work your way into

1540
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,520
a pin testing role and there's nothing

1541
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,440
wrong with that if you

1542
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,240
say you're just you you got a ceh cert

1543
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,160
or you just finished school

1544
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,680
nothing wrong with taking a sock analyst

1545
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,280
job you can learn a lot about that so i

1546
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,800
don't know if anyone here follows tinker

1547
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,119
sec

1548
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,280
from from twitter he's like a really

1549
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,880
great hacker

1550
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,760
and he never took any certification

1551
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,400
courses

1552
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,680
all self-study no certs and

1553
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,800
uh you know he's he's done well with

1554
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,640
without having the certifications and he

1555
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,440
just

1556
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,800
knowing you know knowing people in the

1557
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,040
community and he was a sock analyst so

1558
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,760
he worked

1559
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,000
as a sock analyst and someone heard him

1560
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,440
speak at dallas hackers and he got his

1561
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,319
foot in

1562
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,440
just you know you just have to get out

1563
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,319
there and and network with people

1564
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,760
and you know and it doesn't have to be

1565
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,240
like a immediate meet up that's geared

1566
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,920
towards pen testing you're going to find

1567
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,079
a lot of your opportunities in more of

1568
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,079
the generic security type meetups your

1569
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,599
issa meetings

1570
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,880

managers are going to looking for people

1572

1573
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,400
on it you know the bug bounty stuff i

1574
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,440
mean

1575
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,440

1577
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,880
pen tests they a lot of these bug

1578
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,559
bounties companies also do pen test

1579
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:51,760
along with

1580

and you know working on projects working

1584
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,640
on scripts volunteers some of these open

1585
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,520
source projects

1586
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,240
is a good way to get that information

1587
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,640
good stuff on your resume

1588
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,640
okay philip we have uh one more question

1589
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,680
if you don't mind

1590
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,000
no i don't know what is your advice to a

1591
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,680
current help desk person who wants to

1592
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,760
become a pen tester red teamer

1593
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,359
i got the oscp in my pocket

1594
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,640
do they already have their scp

1595
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,880
or is that what they're focusing on

1596
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,480
that's uh i believe what they're trying

1597
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,359
to focus on

1598
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,400
yeah the oscp is going to help you is

1599
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,440
going to help you get your foot in the

1600
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,079
door there

1601
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,640
and where you're at one thing's it's

1602
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,480
easier to sometimes get into a role if

1603
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,920
you already work somewhere

1604
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,520
so if your company has a security

1605
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,359
department you know just let them know

1606
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,839
you're interested in security because i

1607
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,400
uh expressed my interest of wanting to

1608
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,960
move into security back in like

1609
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,440
2009 and 2000 when i worked at the

1610
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,200
company and it took me to 2004 to

1611
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,119
actually get to move into security

1612
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,800
they knew i had the interest at the time

1613
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,559
they didn't have the roles but yeah work

1614
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,960
on the oscp

1615
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,559
the information you get for that if you

1616
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,079
can land an interview and you

1617
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,880
you pass the oscp and really dig in and

1618
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,079
learn that stuff you're going to be able

1619
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,359
to get through a technical interview

1620
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,559
