00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880

their job search before the pandemic

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,680
started

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,759
and now we actually have some new

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,720
challenges

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,240
with overall job search so first i want

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,680

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
what in particular they're hiring for so

to have you join us

here and i am honored

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,200
that you asked me to be on this panel um

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,840
i

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
am from san antonio texas i work for cps

54
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,520
energy

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,759
um for the talent acquisition team i'm

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,840
the senior recruiter

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
my background i have over 20 years of

58
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,439
human resources

59
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,799
um but my favorite spectrum

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
in hr is recruiting i feel that i'm

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
really good at

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,799
match making people with their the right

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,360
job

64
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,880
because anybody can get a job but it has

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,878
to be the right job and the career

66
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,800
a career track um so that's what i

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,200

68

everything from finance to marketing

105
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,159
hr we've got a lot of cyber security

106
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,599
roles that we're looking to fill

107
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
we are a federal contractor so a lot of

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,360
different openings so

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,640
certainly glad to tell you about all of

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,280
them so great so

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
what's interesting in the conversations

112
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,760
that i've had for over the last 20 years

113
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,239
between

114
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,720
job seekers and recruiters has really

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,519
been

116
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,680
you know they don't understand a typical

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
day for a recruiter they

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,280
you know there's a lot of memes and

119
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,200
images out there that a recruiter just

120
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,000
sits with their

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
feet up on the desk and plays games and

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,480
and maybe sneaks a beer every now and

123
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,560
then when in actuality

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,880
uh recruiters are some of the most

125
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,199
hard-working people that i know

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,839
so rachel you know just tell us sort of

127
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,440
what is your typical day

128
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
like who how many different people do

129
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
you need to interact with

130
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,680
you know do you have emergencies do you

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
have down time

132
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
you know what's a difficult day for for

133
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
rachel

134
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,360
absolutely so for the typical recruiter

135
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
we're going to carry a workbench

136
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,440
anywhere between

137
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,080
10 to 80 openings at any time so that

138
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
means 10 to 80 different

139
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
hiring managers you take each of those

140
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,759
wrecks and you're looking at anywhere

141
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,479
from 100 to 400 applicants

142
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,160
so just in that that's just your

143
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,520
audience that you're working with on a

144
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
day-in day-out basis

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,560
and those come in terms of emails

146
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
emails emails emails and then some more

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,759
emails

148
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,680
we get a lot of phone calls as well hey

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
just wanted to follow up and see if you

150
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,240
got my application

151
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,000
then you have a hiring manager calling

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,280
you the next beat saying

153
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
hey why haven't you sent me any

154
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
applicants or why'd you send me too many

155
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,919
applicants or hey where are the

156
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,720
applicants

157
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
um so really working with just a broad

158
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,120
spectrum of different things i would say

159
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
in an eight hour day

160
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
you're probably working nine hours of

161
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
that just communicating with different

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
hiring managers and candidates alike so

163
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,360
busy is an understatement

164
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
lisa you were mentioning earlier that

165
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,199
you know even though you're not hiring

166
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,800
right now i know that in

167
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
a typical day that you are doing a lot

168
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,240
as far as

169
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,520
cultivating candidates um following up

170
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,160
on

171
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
various different projects following up

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,759
on different people that you've hired

173
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,039
so what happened to cps energy behind

174
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,080
the scenes for you

175
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
as far as developing your overall talent

176
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
pipeline

177
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
well with the covet um i actually i feel

178
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,400
like

179
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
we have come as our my team has come

180
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,160
together even more

181
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,880
we're not so much at our desk now in the

182
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,160
office at our desk

183
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,479
24th we when we go to the office we're

184
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,520
at our computer

185
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,840
all the time we don't interact very much

186
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
but because of this

187
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,560
we meet every morning in webex

188
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
and so i see my co-workers and my team

189
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,520
and my managers more now

190
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,759
than i did when i was in the office i

191
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,880
also feel that

192
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,400
um our communication with candidates

193
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,080
is is more often now because now they're

194
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
looking for employment what's the status

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
what's going on

196
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,080
are y'all hiring contractors or reaching

197
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,639
out

198
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,160
so i think our communication has

199
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,120
increased our more one-on-one

200
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
has increased than it normally would

201
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,440
have if we were in the office

202
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
so what i do is a lot of outreach i go

203
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
on linkedin

204
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
i check my candidates that have applied

205
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,080
and

206
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,319
i look at those every day because it

207
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,520
like i said that one position is up

208
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,639
until july 31st

209
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,720
so one thing i will say is that the

210
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
candidates have

211
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,039
we will have more time to look at their

212
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,280
resumes than we normally would

213
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
would y'all agree on that rachel that

214
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,039
you have more time to

215
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,520
do a second or third review of resumes

216
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,360
because of this situation or

217
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,720
no not quite as much sometimes we do

218
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
right now we're just seeing a large

219
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
amount of applicants and i think a lot

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,599
of that's due to the unemployment rate

221
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,160
when it went

222
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,319
shot up from single digit now to double

223
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,400
digits the number of applicants we're

224
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
getting is tremendous so

225
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
i would almost say probably the opposite

226
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
we're getting to spend a little less

227
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,080
time

228
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
on each resume just because where it may

229
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,240
have been 50 applicants before now we're

230
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,319
looking at 150 applicants

231
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,240
from coast to coast and the other piece

232
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,160
to that is before

233
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
everything was very geographically based

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
so we needed you to be in broomfield

235
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
colorado

236
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
or in monroe louisiana or wherever the

237
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
case was and now it's we've realized you

238
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
can do work anywhere so it's opened up

239
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
where folks were applying from so that's

240
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,800
also increased our applicant pool so

241
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,639
um i would say we've developed better

242
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
relationships with candidates just

243
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,479
because technology has changed so much

244
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000
that we're able to do things like this

245
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,720
face-to-face

246
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,960
interviews and things like that but for

247
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,479
us i would say we probably even shorten

248
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,080
that seven second window to probably

249
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,800
five seconds

250
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
of reviewing those resumes so rachel you

251
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,160
you

252
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
you uh rachel you you touched on

253
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
something there which was you know my

254
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
next question

255
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
what are some of the tools like you know

256
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
lisa was mentioning that there's much

257
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,160
more face-to-face going on

258
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,479
but what should be some of the tools due

259
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,080
to covid that

260
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,399
job seekers really should get a handle

261
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,360
on because

262
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,159
we are doing a lot more virtual

263
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,519
interviewing but also

264
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,120
what about these events i mean i'm

265
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
seeing a lot of career events and

266
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
networking events so

267
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,839
rachel what are some of the tools that

268
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,200
the job seekers should really be

269
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
focusing on

270
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
i think before you even come to the

271
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
events a great tool right now is to go

272
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
out there and check those resumes

273
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
there are so many free databases you can

274
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
just google it google knows everything

275
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
but there's so many different ways that

276
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,279
you can enhance your resume

277
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,800
just since we are in those really

278
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
tightened resume review periods

279
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
go out there make sure that you're

280
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
putting all of that relevant information

281
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,480
first

282
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,760
and there's tools out there that can

283
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,279
help you do that and we've seen a lot of

284
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:13,839
those

285
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,360
really rise to the surface just because

286
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,880
the need has become greater for people

287
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,519
to

288
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,120
create resumes and such so i would say

289
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,279
that's step one the second piece is

290
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,080
become very

291
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,399
familiar with the different platforms we

292
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,839
use microsoft teams an

293
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,920
awful lot um and that's what we're doing

294
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
for video interviewing we're using it

295
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,080
for

296
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,880
different ones zoom is another one go

297
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
out there and download them now

298
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
learn to play with them there's

299
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
different backgrounds you can even use

300
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,640
in there to make it a little bit more

301
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
fun and show your personality

302
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,560
so become familiar with those platforms

303
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
make sure you've

304
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,200
you know tested out your technology

305
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
before you're going to engage

306
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
with any kind of recruiter or any kind

307
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
of hiring manager there's nothing worse

308
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
than sounding like charlie brown's

309
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,640
teacher

310
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
in the middle of an interview so make

311
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
sure you've practiced it you've gone

312
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,880
through it

313
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,399
but really harness that so really make

314
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
sure you're using the tools ahead of

315
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
coming to there so that your resume can

316
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,959
be selected

317
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,720
to make it to the event and when you're

318
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,000
doing events like this

319
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,360
same kind of thing make sure you're

320
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
actively engaged not very often do you

321
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,680
get that

322
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,839
face-to-face interaction even though

323
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,360
we're not physically next to each other

324
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
you're getting that audience so

325
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
take advantage of it you know it's not

326
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,079
very often that happens

327
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,200
so seize the moment carpe diem

328
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
so lisa what are some of the what are

329
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
the platforms the technical platforms

330
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
that you're using to engage with

331
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,480
candidates and also

332
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
engage with your co-workers we use webex

333
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,200
and microsoft team with my co-workers

334
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,920
and we do

335
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,720
our virtual interviews are with webex um

336
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,240
because they can do calendar invites

337
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,360
those are the platforms i use we use for

338
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,000
our interviews

339
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
and our our staff meetings

340
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,160
yeah it's it's interesting because when

341
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
we started with kovid

342
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
everyone was saying oh everyone's going

343
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,040
to be on zoom

344
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,519
and then all of a sudden i realized that

345
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,640
we had people

346
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,720
that were on go to webinar they were on

347
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
zoom they were on microsoft teams they

348
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
were on google hangouts they were

349
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,440
on you know a whole variety of different

350
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,399
platforms

351
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,320
so this is something i would really say

352
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,519
as far as

353
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,920
as you're going through your job search

354
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,079
be sure you ask in some of the initial

355
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,240
conversations with the recruiter

356
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,519
you know if we're going to go to the

357
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,600
next step if we're going to go beyond

358
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,079
the phone call please find out the

359
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,519
platform that you're going to be on

360
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
because i can't tell you how many times

361
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,920
i've naturally assumed

362
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,120
that there was going to be um

363
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,480
you know everything was going to be on

364
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,959
zoom and i didn't check my calendar

365
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,640
invite and all of a sudden it's in the

366
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,800
go to webinar it's in the webex

367
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,440
it's in the join me it's something so

368
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
and realize that you do

369
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
have to uh do a little bit more

370
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
technical checkup i mean i know we're

371
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,839
talking to an extremely

372
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,720
technical audience here but so many of

373
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
us have gotten tripped up

374
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,079
at the last minute an update decides to

375
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,680
come through right in the middle of an

376
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,560
interview

377
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
or something else happens on your

378
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,360
computer that you didn't plan i mean

379
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
you know there's there's always going to

380
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
be you know

381
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,160
something will happen so we just had a

382
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,200
question come in from the audience and i

383
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
think it's one that we can we can expand

384
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,959
on a little bit and i'm happy

385
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,079
to answer this also in the um

386
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,480
in the career channel later but in what

387
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
ways do you think the job market will be

388
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,120
different

389
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,440
after the pandemic will it be more or

390
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,279
less competitive

391
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,079
before uh more or less competitive than

392
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:36,560
before

393
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,959
covet so rachel you were touching on

394
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,399
that a little bit

395
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,360
so you want to expand sure i think you

396
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,880
know the major change is just going to

397
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,600
be how

398
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
and where work is done and you know

399
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
we've talked about that and

400
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
meetings across from our ceo down has

401
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,120
just said the way we thought work could

402
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,079
be done we've

403
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,920
realized that it's been toppled and now

404
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
we can do work a whole different way

405
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
so i think just the landscape and the

406
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,880
way we're doing work is going to feel

407
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,639
different the way we collaborate feels

408
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,680
different

409
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,200
i feel like it's going to be more

410
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,360
competitive and what we're looking for

411
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,040
in the future there's different skills

412
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,760
people that

413
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,360
again where some of those geographies

414
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
may have limited folks before

415
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,519
now that it's open from coast to coast

416
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,440
or even internationally

417
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,720
it really it's going to be able to take

418
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,399
in all of those different talents so

419
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
before if we were only hiring in

420
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,959
broomfield

421
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,959
folks only from the broomfield area may

422
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,399
have been willing to apply or would have

423
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,360
to relocate

424
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
but now that we can consider folks from

425
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
norcross for

426
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
georgia i mean it completely changes so

427
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
i believe the competitive landscape

428
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
is also going to change just because

429
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
there's talent now available from coast

430
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,519
to coast

431
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,519
and so rachel what you're really talking

432
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,199
about are sort of the admin

433
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,040
jobs and things like that but we also

434
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,560
have a lot of people who

435
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,720
have to go to client sites and they have

436
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,399
to visit specific

437
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
uh facilities and lisa this is you know

438
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:53,839
i

439
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,000
wanted you to address this question sort

440
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
of from the standpoint that you have

441
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,440
people that need to go into specific

442
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
headquarters or specific

443
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,440
facilities do you think the job market

444
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
will be more competitive after covid or

445
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
less competitive

446
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,399
i think it'd be more competitive i think

447
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,800
that we have learned to work

448
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,199
virtually remote you know we are located

449
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,839
in san antonio texas and we've had

450
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,920
we were we did have hi we hired some

451
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
candidates that couldn't come to san

452
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
antonio texas because of the covet

453
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,839
um so they were working remote from

454
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,680
illinois in fact we have one guy in

455
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,959
illinois right now

456
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,800
that's working for cps energy san

457
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
antonio texas but he's in illinois

458
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,519
right now um so we would we would have

459
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,880
never done that

460
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,079
so i think it's going to be more

461
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,240
competitive and more

462
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,639
geographical like rachel had stated that

463
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,000
it's not necessarily you have to come

464
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,440
into the office and work monday through

465
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,920
friday

466
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,320
eight to five at a desk so i agree with

467
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
rachel on that

468
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,240
yes we would also say we have i'm sorry

469
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
kathleen i was just gonna say even for

470
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,440
roles that we have that do

471
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
that maybe our customer facing or things

472
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,720
like that where they're going into

473
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,920
offices

474
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
a lot of customers don't want folks

475
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
coming into their house or maybe those

476
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,000
businesses are closed

477
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
so i think it's completely

478
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
revolutionized the way that you're even

479
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
able to engage with them so we now have

480
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,079
technicians that are able to do installs

481
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,079
from over we've got cyber security doing

482
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,920
things from different locations so

483
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,839
even the way the work is done has

484
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
completely changed so outside of just

485
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,639
the normal

486
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,279
you know eight to five you know paper

487
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:23,839
pushers

488
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,760
uh us and hr you know it really has

489
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,279
changed the way our folks that are more

490
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,959
engaged with customers or different

491
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,680
businesses

492
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,440
and um you know we're a federal

493
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,880
contractor so even working with the

494
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,160
department of interior

495
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
it's different how we engage with them

496
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
than it was pre-covet so

497
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
it's been you know transformed not only

498
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,600
our industry and every industry but

499
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480
our customers and their customers yeah i

500
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,199
was really

501
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,920
in um felt really great when i saw that

502
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
the gsa which really sort of establishes

503
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,079
guidelines for

504
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,759
how government contractors and

505
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,360
government agencies

506
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,600
work and their workflow they had

507
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,959
actually started

508
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,399
uh under the leadership of casey coleman

509
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,199
um gosh 10 11 years ago they had already

510
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,279
started doing more telework more

511
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,639
hoteling more

512
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,440
you know getting the workforce ready for

513
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
being more remote because we were

514
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,880
constantly being hit here in the

515
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,759
washington dc area with very large

516
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,160
snowstorms or things that would really

517
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,720
impact people going into the offices so

518
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
you know everything sort of has been

519
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
building uh

520
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,199
to this being more of a remote workforce

521
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,680
i know that when kovid started i was

522
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,519
part of a podcast with

523
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,360
several people who were recruiters out

524
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,639
of the silicon valley

525
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,600
and several of them were startups and

526
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,279
they were saying you know wow this has

527
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,440
really opened our eyes because

528
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,519
we were really concerned about how we

529
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,360
were going to compete with really good

530
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,079
talent

531
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,800
in the san francisco area and all of a

532
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,399
sudden as you said they can talk to

533
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,519
people in colorado

534
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,120
utah so uh this is ever shifting

535
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,839
so i i think that every three or four

536
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,279
months we're going to see a different

537
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,439
kind of job competitiveness

538
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,679
but i think one thing what we will see

539
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,640
is

540
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,839
people who are more comfortable being

541
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,679
independent and having their own

542
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,520
initiative and being

543
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,079
able to set boundaries those are going

544
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,640
to be

545
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,839
another set of the soft skills

546
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,720
that many people are looking for because

547
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,240
many of the managers

548
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,480
are haven't been trained on how to

549
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,440
manage

550
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
through zoom but if you do want to learn

551
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
how to manage through zoom

552
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
come back to this track our last talk of

553
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,320
the day

554
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,280
is with mike murray who is a founder of

555
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,400
a healthcare

556
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,039
security firm his second entrepreneurial

557
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,840
venture

558
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,080
and he is going to be talking about

559
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
leading and managing teams through

560
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,160
uh zoom so just a little advertisement

561
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
for later on

562
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,400
so i want to get back more into this

563
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
sort of job search because job search

564
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,480
pre-covered or deering kovid is

565
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,559
some of the basic elements are still the

566
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,160
same and

567
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,120
we over the 20 years that i've been in

568
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,240
the community

569
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,880
i have seen the exact same problems the

570
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,679
exact same

571
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,960
challenges on the candidate side over

572
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
and over and over again

573
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,919
so you know lisa what is what are one or

574
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,320
two

575
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
things that you have seen job seekers

576
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,320
continually do

577
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,600
that is a hindrance to their job search

578
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,360
well i think the first you have to meet

579
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,640
the minimum requirements

580
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,720
look at the minimum requirements first

581
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
before applying

582
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
make sure that you can check the box

583
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
i've done this i've done this and then

584
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,520
could you

585
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
if i'd ask you to give me example when

586
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
you did this you you need to be able to

587
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,679
come up with

588
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,240
an answer that you actually did it so

589
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,520
meet the minimum requirements

590
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
and then we were talking earlier if you

591
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,039
have any certifications

592
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,880
put them on the top of the resume put

593
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,039
them that that's the most important

594
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,960
um in it positions i'm looking for

595
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
certifications

596
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,760
so i'm looking at minimum requirements

597
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
and i'm looking at certifications

598
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,280
and if you're new to the i.t arena or

599
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
you want to break into the it arena

600
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
you need to go find out what search you

601
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,960
need in the area of i.t

602
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,480
that you want to work in and start

603
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
working on those right now

604
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,720
um so those are those two two items that

605
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
i would look at first

606
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,960
yes it's i've been doing some resume

607
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
review in my spare time

608
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,000
over on discord on several other servers

609
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,160
and i can tell you that there is just

610
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,600
this trend

611
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,840
and has been a trend for 10 years with

612
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,480
tech resumes to make it look pretty

613
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,320
and i'm sorry please stop making your

614
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
tech resume look pretty

615
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
keep it very simple i don't need boxes i

616
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,440
don't need

617
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,559
shading i don't need graphs i don't need

618
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,120
anything

619
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,240
please realize that it is going to be

620
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,039
sent through an

621
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,440
applicant tracking system and that

622
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,799
applicant tracking system

623
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,880
is going to pull data and if it can't

624
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,400
pull data cleanly

625
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,799
it is going to pull something else and

626
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,559
you're never going to know

627
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,039
the user interface of the applicant

628
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,720
tracking system that the recruiter is

629
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,520
using there are

630
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,760
several applicant tracking systems out

631
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,679
there and you're never going to know

632
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,159
what is the applicant tracking system

633
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,480
that the recruiter is using so please

634
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,159
keep it as simple as possible now

635
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,720
another advertisement we will be doing

636
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
resume review today

637
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
at one to three over in the career

638
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,720
channel so you'll have an

639
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,799
opportunity to have your resume reviewed

640
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,200
by two tech recruiters and myself

641
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,760
so rachel what are one or two things

642
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,400
that you

643
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
see candidates constantly doing that you

644
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
wish they wouldn't do

645
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,919
i would say resumes are not one size

646
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,960
fits all

647
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,600
so you may have a resume for one role

648
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
and there's nothing more disheartening

649
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,000
than reading a resume

650
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,159
that says applying for a you know

651
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,760
medical receptionist and you're like but

652
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,960
you applied for

653
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,280
a scrub master i don't understand so

654
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
make sure you know anything you have in

655
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
there is relevant

656
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,919
to what you're applying for that you're

657
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,480
not just having

658
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,159
those relevant things up front but that

659
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,679
it all matches think about those

660
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,600
different skills that relate to the job

661
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,679
so it does take time looking for a job

662
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,520
is a job and it shouldn't be something

663
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,200
that just takes three seconds to apply

664
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,520
it is work so make sure that those match

665
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,799
and the other piece that i would add to

666
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,880
that that um i know i've had many

667
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
conversations with candidates throughout

668
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
is if there's an assessment or there's a

669
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,600
video interview required for the role

670
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,159
take it and take it as soon as you apply

671
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,679
we have folks that will sit on it and

672
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,280
wait till the end of the cycle well then

673
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,880
they miss out on the opportunity to be

674
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,760
considered

675
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,360
and will write back and say well how

676
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,039
dare you and it's like well friend you

677
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,320
had 14 days

678
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,919
make sure you take it so take it take it

679
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,000
off and take them seriously

680
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
it's not just a personality quiz like

681
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,440
you'd be taken out of a magazine it's

682
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,640
really to assess

683
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
your fit for that role so take it

684
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,799
seriously take it timely

685
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,480
and make sure your resume matches for

686
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
what you're applying for

687
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
and we we had sort of a question from

688
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,400
the audience as far as

689
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,760
you know we're we're talking about

690
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,320
minimum requirements and i'm always

691
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,840
uh sort of intrigued when i see studies

692
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,280
in the community that women will only

693
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,240
apply

694
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,679
if they believe they meet 95

695
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,720
of what the job asks and most men

696
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,240
will apply if they meet 50

697
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,159
so so i'm just letting you know there

698
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,000
are minimum requirements

699
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,320
you know college degree certain

700
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,440
certifications

701
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
those are the minimum requirements and

702
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,880
being able to have

703
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
a certain amount of three to five years

704
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,159
jobs

705
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,960
experience then start delving deeper

706
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,760
into

707
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,520
what the job is asking for but you know

708
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,400
as if if you're a barista and you're

709
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,679
applying to be a pen

710
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,159
tester i think you know you you might

711
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,520
want to really check those

712
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,559
uh those minimum requirements so there

713
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,200
are many

714
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,840
different stages of the job search

715
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,960
process

716
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,880
and there are many different stages

717
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,320
where someone can

718
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,360
sort of mess up and i'm just wondering

719
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,919
rachel do you is there one place that

720
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,200
you see

721
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
job seekers tending to sort of like mess

722
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,880
up they don't get it

723
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
what they need to do next you pointed

724
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
went out earlier doing

725
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,039
all of the tests but what are some of

726
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,640
the other areas where

727
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,679
uh job seekers sort of miss the the step

728
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,640
that they need

729
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,559
a little bit yeah i would say

730
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,760
communication

731
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,600
um is probably a big one where we see a

732
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
lot of stumbling going on and a lot of

733
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,159
time it's

734
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
it's you know we want to assume positive

735
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,600
intent that it really is you're just so

736
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,080
excited

737
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,520
about the role you want to find out

738
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,679
where you are in the process um but you

739
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,480
then it becomes

740
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,679
almost on the verge of a little

741
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,240
stalkerish uh when you're getting 15 to

742
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,360
20 calls a day hey

743
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,640
just checking in with you how's my

744
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,559
resume looking um you know

745
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,320
have that understanding that there are

746
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,159
many people that are also interested in

747
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:52,960
the same role

748
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
so give a little bit of grace and a

749
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
little bit of understanding to the

750
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,240
recruiter

751
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
and when you are communicating know that

752
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,360
we're not robots um as much as you know

753
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
artificial intelligence exists a

754
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,559
recruiter is a recruiter and we have

755
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,520
feelings too

756
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,679
uh so when you write emails that are

757
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,960
snarky or

758
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
you know well if you would sit around

759
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
and do your job know that we really

760
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,000
are and we have the best interest at

761
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,600
heart we really do just like lisa

762
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
alluded to it's matchmaking it's trying

763
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,080
to find the best

764
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
talent for the best role and the other

765
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
piece that we know we also know the

766
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,880
hiring manager

767
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
so we know the the wants and the desires

768
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
of that hiring manager so it's really

769
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,600
putting together this

770
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,440
master forum to try to find the right

771
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
candidates we want to make the best use

772
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,840
of your time

773
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,120
just like we want to make the best use

774
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
of you know of our team's time as well

775
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
so it's making sure resources are

776
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,919
aligned appropriately

777
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,799
so just communicate appropriately if you

778
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,640
don't get an immediate phone call return

779
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
or you don't get an immediate email

780
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
don't take it personally please know

781
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
that we love you all you're all

782
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,200
beautiful and wonderful and talented

783
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,720
however you know it's usually one

784
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,559
recruiter to a thousand people

785
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,480
um so if you just look at those ratios

786
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,159
it's very hard to make sure that you're

787
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,760
communicating we really want to do our

788
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,559
best

789
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,000
i had an interesting engagement with a

790
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
gentleman who it was related to an

791
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,919
assessment and he wrote back and

792
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,000
was not very kind um he had some things

793
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,440
to say about my mom and everything in

794
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,240
between

795
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
um but you know it was able to respond

796
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,840
and say you know i appreciate that you

797
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,039
responded back and

798
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,799
his immediate response back was you know

799
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,720
i'm so sorry i have gotten

800
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,080
not a lot of response from different

801
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
companies and i forget that you're a

802
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,120
human on the other end and he said

803
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
you've completely changed my perspective

804
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,799
just by responding so know that we

805
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,559
really really do want to respond

806
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,960
but use your communication use it wisely

807
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,720
and my mama's a very nice person

808
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,559
so please no more mama jokes

809
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,679
i'd love to be a fly on the wall

810
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,679
listening reading your emails but

811
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,640
i get the same i do i i get a lot of

812
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
people who

813
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
don't understand that i'm not a

814
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,440
recruiter that i'm not a head hunter

815
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,799
that i'm not a staff

816
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,559
person and they'll send me a message

817
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,480
saying look at my linkedin profile and

818
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,360
find me a job

819
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,159
and i'll be like that's not my job

820
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,360
that's your job

821
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,600
and your job is to read my profile to

822
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,640
find out if i

823
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,840
am someone who can help you so uh

824
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,720
realize that that uh finding the right

825
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,159
person to communicate with

826
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,720
really does help so lisa what are some

827
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,520
of the

828
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,840
areas where you have seen job seekers

829
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
sort of miss the boat on

830
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,000
uh their overall engagement with you

831
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,559
i i really i can't think of anything

832
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,440
other than the

833
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
virtual interviews now that's a new

834
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,120
thing so

835
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,960
what we do what we've done before the

836
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
covet is we would set up the interviews

837
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,360
and then before the recruiter such as

838
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,400
myself i would

839
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,279
do a practice run the day before just to

840
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,240
make sure you're

841
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,000
ready to go and most of them haven't

842
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,840
even opened their inbox

843
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,480
and haven't downloaded the the software

844
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:44,960
or

845
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,279
you know whatever it was microsoft team

846
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,080
or webex they hadn't even done that yet

847
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,679
so it takes a little bit of effort on

848
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,520
the recruiter's side just to make sure

849
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,679
that all the check and balances are done

850
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,120
before the actual interview

851
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,559
and practice the interview and get your

852
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,480
background i think someone had a

853
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,039
had it out in their garage so make sure

854
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,320
even though it's at home you're still

855
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,720
doing

856
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,440
a professional interview so dress up and

857
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,400
show up and

858
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
make sure your background isn't your

859
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,320
garage or your closet

860
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,960
you know something like that and just

861
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,679
practice

862
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,520
practice your ques you know get used to

863
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
seeing yourself on the screen

864
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,880
and just do a practice run a dry run um

865
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,600
that's really it today is that and then

866
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,480
rachel

867
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,600
hit on something we are human beings and

868
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,679
please remember that we know the hr

869
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,520
manager we talk to them

870
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,000
they've told us what they really want it

871
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,840
may not be on the job posting but we

872
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200
really know

873
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,279
what the hr man we know his personality

874
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,799
we know the culture

875
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,200
um and so we are the matchmaker so let

876
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,399
us do our job

877
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,640
and then rachel and kathleen how much

878
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
how often

879
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,640
should a candidate check in with you

880
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,919
on a job what would be the grace period

881
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,760
so i i usually say first and foremost be

882
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,159
sure you've sent a thank you note after

883
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,840
any virtual interview or

884
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,559
any phone screening or anything like

885
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,360
that

886
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
and then use the thank you note as a

887
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,039
time to

888
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,240
add in another selling point as to why

889
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,399
you're good for that job or something

890
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,399
that was part of the conversation

891
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,440
sort of like yes i went to alabama or

892
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
you know it was great to talk to you

893
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,360
about i know rachel i had to throw that

894
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,080
one in

895
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
you know it was great to talk to you

896
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,440
about how we're missing the football

897
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,360
season or something like that so

898
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,919
personalize the thank you note and also

899
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,360
realize that the thank you note

900
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,480
is a time where you

901
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
can add in information that you sort of

902
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,480
forgot because we all

903
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,120
tend to freeze up during interviews and

904
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
there's like that one really great story

905
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,840
or that really great tidbit that really

906
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,799
shares

907
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,039
why you're great for that position well

908
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,120
you add that into the thank you note

909
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,000
and then as you're doing your last

910
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,360
conversation

911
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,799
with the recruiter ask them what is the

912
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,320
follow-up timeline

913
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
you know should i call you next week

914
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,919
should i call you tomorrow

915
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,039
get an idea from them on the timeline

916
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,760
rachel anything you want to add to that

917
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,279
you took the words out of mouth i was

918
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,480
going to say you know kind of be the

919
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,399
master right there and ask that question

920
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,120
and say

921
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,960
hey you know so what do next steps look

922
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,200
like what does that timeline look like

923
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,279
i think it also puts the recruiter in a

924
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,240
state of accountability

925
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,480
as well so if you say if they say hey

926
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,760
you know we expect to have a decision

927
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,960
the next week and a half

928
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,320
or something like that hold them

929
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,559
accountable as well because things do

930
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,200
happen

931
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
so make sure you ask ask you know what

932
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,200
is a good time should i follow up

933
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
how can i follow up things like that i

934
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,000
think the thank you notes are fantastic

935
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
i think sometimes where candidates again

936
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,679
sometimes stumble and and i

937
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,360
i completely empathize because sometimes

938
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,880
it does feel like you're putting your

939
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,960
application into a dark hole and are you

940
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,399
ever going to hear anything back

941
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,000
so i understand that that lack of

942
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,919
certainty of did they even receive my

943
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,799
application

944
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
so find out if there is some kind of

945
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,080
usually you know i know we have an

946
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,679
automated service that you can send an

947
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,799
email to and just say

948
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,559
i want to make sure my application was

949
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,159
received and we have a team that can

950
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,440
look at that just to you know give you

951
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
that level of comfort

952
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,320
that it is being received and i will

953
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,600
tell you something that we're striving

954
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,279
for and trying to do and i'm sure lisa

955
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,240
is doing the same and

956
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,399
across the board in all industries is

957
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,240
the thing we hear most often is i never

958
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,440
heard anything back

959
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,039
i've applied and i've never heard

960
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,120
anything back so something i know i do

961
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
with my team is i'll go in and audit

962
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,440
and make sure emails have been sent um

963
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,120
that we are doing those things so we are

964
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,960
really trying to shore up that gap

965
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
because i think we do own the fact that

966
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,159
sometimes communication

967
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,720
isn't as timely so my apologies for the

968
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,640
entire industry we're going to do better

969
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,399
uh but just know that we do want to

970
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,240
communicate with you we are looking for

971
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,799
ways

972
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,799
but i think the advice kathleen gave is

973
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,399
100 spot-on

974
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,480
ask at the end of that interview you

975
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,559
know what is a good time how often and

976
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,480
how can i do it and you know we'll be

977
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,679
glad to make sure we

978
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,120
align with that sounds great so

979
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,480
it's it's interesting that one thing

980
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,640
that i noticed that a lot of job seekers

981
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,240
don't understand

982
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,440
is that if they don't get the job

983
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,320
they actually should continue networking

984
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,240
with you correct

985
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,519
so um and you know even though i know a

986
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,360
lot of people would really love to get

987
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,720
sort of that feedback

988
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,840
and that download as we talked earlier

989
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,440
it's just not going to be

990
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,200
possible but realize that keeping a

991
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,600
relationship with a recruiter

992
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,240
is definitely one part of your overall

993
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,360
career success

994
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,120
because we look at our network of people

995
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,399
so we'll have someone who

996
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,720
we go to for movie recommendations and

997
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,320
we'll have someone who'll go to for

998
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,919
restaurant recommendations and we'll

999
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,039
have someone to go to

1000
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,720
for vacation recommendations but our job

1001
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,320
is a key component of our overall life

1002
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,200
but how many recruiters do you have in

1003
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
your overall network

1004
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,679
so my recommendation is if you've had a

1005
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,600
really good conversation

1006
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,159
with a recruiter if someone has treated

1007
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,039
you very well

1008
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,080
you got along on in the interview but

1009
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,240
all of a sudden you weren't the right

1010
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,279
fit

1011
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,880
still thank that recruiter for their

1012
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,440
time and still keep up to date with them

1013
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,120
you know make sure you've connected on

1014
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,080
linkedin

1015
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,159
and then if something has happened like

1016
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,240
if you've gotten a new certification

1017
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,600
if you've gotten a promotion or

1018
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,519
something like that just take a few

1019
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,000
moments

1020
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,760
to reach out to the recruiters in your

1021
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,440
network and say hey

1022
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,120
you know just wanted to say hi hope

1023
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
you're doing well are you staying safe

1024
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,480
during covid

1025
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,000
just want to let you know i just passed

1026
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,679
my cissp

1027
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,519
would love to keep in touch with you if

1028
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,720
there are any other

1029
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
opportunities come down your way because

1030
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,440
i know recruiters specifically in

1031
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,480
the communities i'm in they have

1032
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,159
candidates that they keep in touch with

1033
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,000
for three to six years

1034
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
because they know that there is going to

1035
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,440
be at one point

1036
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,880
that they're going to have the right job

1037
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,200
for that person so i'm

1038
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,120
i'm going to sort of switch gears here

1039
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
just a little bit

1040
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,039
and i'm going to touch on two specific

1041
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,440
segments of the community that

1042
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,240
really sort of always ask questions so

1043
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,679
the first and i'm going to throw this to

1044
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,120
lisa because i know this is one of her

1045
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,559
favorite topics

1046
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,039
if we have some folks in the audience

1047
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,360
who are transitioning military

1048
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,440
what are one or two things that you

1049
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,600
would recommend that they do

1050
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,919
to help their job search moving into the

1051
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,320
civilian world

1052
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,600
the first thing is take a personality

1053
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,039
test

1054
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,519
because and why i say that is because a

1055
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,279
lot especially if they've done their 20

1056
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,120
years or even 10 years

1057
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,720
they think that they need to find a job

1058
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,240
that they did in the military in the

1059
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,320
civilian world

1060
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,880
but they have to remember the military

1061
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,360
chose

1062
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
them for that job right based on their

1063
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,679
test scores so this time around

1064
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,880
let's find a job that matches you um so

1065
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,720
there's several personality tests that

1066
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,960
you can take and it'll kind of tell you

1067
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,440
where

1068
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,559
um i think the brixmeyer myers-briggs i

1069
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,279
always get those

1070
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,880
that's a really good one because it'll

1071
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,719
tell you what kind of job you'd be

1072
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,639
a good fit for and when you take the

1073
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,239
test it's

1074
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,320
it should only take a less than one or

1075
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,760
two minutes to take the test

1076
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,079
and don't think about it so the military

1077
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,679
will think about it what should i do as

1078
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,560
a leader

1079
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,480
in this situation you take the test to

1080
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,320
take it very quickly don't think about

1081
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,719
it

1082
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,879
and that way we can pinpoint where your

1083
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,040
next job should be what area

1084
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,599
um the second thing is you've already

1085
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,399
been told this

1086
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,159
well actually the second thing is

1087
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,800
network you don't know how to network

1088
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
because you've been wearing that uniform

1089
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
for so long you walk into the room i

1090
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
know your name i know your rank

1091
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,918
um so you don't have to introduce

1092
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,119
yourself so practice your elevator pitch

1093
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,280
start networking start getting used to

1094
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,159
these virtual career fairs

1095
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,719
linkedin's a very good one start

1096
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,560
networking on linkedin and don't put

1097
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,800

1098
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,280

1100
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,920
as a suit don't and take all military

1101

who is a retired navy captain

1126
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,440
and had spent the last three years

1127
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,480
before he

1128
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,760
uh retired as a recruiter bob wheeler

1129
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,079
and uh he is someone that rachel knows

1130
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,119
quite well but

1131
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,680
bob is also well known in the community

1132
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
for writing about

1133
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,520
transitioning military and the things

1134
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,720
that they need to do

1135
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,000
to be successful in their career and bob

1136
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,240
will be floating around in the career uh

1137
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,480
track today answering any questions for

1138
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,680
transitioning million

1139
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,280
uh military folks so rachel

1140
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,119
anything to add for our transitioning

1141
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,960
military folks

1142
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,359
i would just say look at your skill set

1143
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,960
holistically and while that may have

1144
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,560
been your assignment or that particular

1145
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,599
job that you held

1146
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,200
think of those different relatable

1147
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,880
skills and how they could fit into other

1148
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,320
roles so i think lisa

1149
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,000
hit the nail on the head you know just

1150
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,200
kind of talking about those different

1151
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,640
assessments and what is it that you want

1152
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,359
to do

1153
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,800
but also give yourself some

1154
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
understanding that you are bringing

1155
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,640
so much talent to the table and just

1156
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,079
make sure that you're collecting that

1157
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,440
and that you're using that and

1158
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,040
ask the question say hey this is what i

1159
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,680
did how would this fit in and ask those

1160
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,119
questions find somebody in a similar

1161
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,640
role and say what what does your day

1162
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,440
look like

1163
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
um and you'll find amazing ways that

1164
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,880
those are those just

1165
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,640
cross over one another and you're the

1166
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,920
perfect person for the role and you

1167
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,359
didn't give yourself enough credit to

1168
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,000
assume

1169
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,280
that you were the right person for the

1170
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,240
role so the other segment

1171
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,400
of the community that we tend to get

1172
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,599
some challenges with

1173
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,440
and it's not that they're challenging

1174
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,760
it's just they have unique needs as far

1175
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
as their job search is concerned so

1176
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,720

1178
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,599
networking great place to start learning

1179
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,079

1180
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,119
practices and skills uh it's really

1181
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,320
uh very interesting that people don't

1182
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
understand that all of the experience

1183
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,040
that you

1184
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,359
have being part of the capture of the

1185
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,000
flags or volunteering for the virtual

1186
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,800
cons

1187
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
any of that all of that is technical and

1188
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,800
soft skills that you are developing

1189
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,280
and it's getting you experience so be

1190
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,839
sure you're getting that experience

1191
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,240

1192
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,160

lisa so i would look at your local

1198
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,640

1202
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,000
um membership you can join to start your

1203
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,440
networking

1204
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,720
um example uh i know we have

1205
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,960
i mentioned geektem and then this form

1206
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,800
here you could meet someone

1207
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,160
that could help you in the future

1208
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,079
that's what i would do just start start

1209
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,280
getting out there and

1210
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,359
networking with people that could

1211
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,800
possibly

1212
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
help you the other thing is it's easier

1213
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
to find a job or

1214
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,000
get your application looked at if you

1215
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,320
know somebody in the company

1216
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,240
if you know that that's why networking

1217
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,839
is so important

1218
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,800
because you're competing for one job and

1219
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,359
there could be over 100 applications

1220
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,920
so if you know someone buy them through

1221
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,720
a membership

1222
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,000
you can say hey i applied for this

1223
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,839
position is there anything you can help

1224
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,520
me with or can you assist

1225
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,000
so that's why networking and joining

1226
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,680
your clubs and memberships

1227
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,280
in the field that you want to get to is

1228
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,000
so important

1229
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,040
rachel how about you i think those are

1230
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,119
both amazing examples and finding a

1231
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,800
mentor that's going to give you honest

1232
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,560
constructive feedback

1233
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,079
um i would take it just that one next

1234
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
layer up just because you want

1235
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,359
you know we all assume we're the best at

1236
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,040
everything but having someone offer that

1237
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,480
constructive feedback

1238
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,640
really helps you better craft your you

1239
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,400
know your skills and your talents and

1240
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,000
and be more prepared so

1241
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,680
uh you know find that good mentor that's

1242
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,440
in that field or related field and i

1243
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,480
think that's just

1244
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,720
one additional step but i think you know

1245
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,599
networking is fantastic

1246
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,560
so um i'm gonna throw you a question

1247
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,280
that we

1248
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,040
haven't prepared for because i like

1249
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,960
doing that every now and then

1250
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,760
so what's interesting is a lot of people

1251
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,079
go

1252
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,119
through all of this sort of like help

1253
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,880
to get a job and they sweat it out

1254
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
and they finally get the job and then

1255
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
they rest on their laurels like oh god i

1256
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,839
finally got the job

1257
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,880
however i was told over 30 years ago the

1258
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,119
most important time in your job

1259
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,359
is the first six months so what are some

1260
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:20,720
recommendations that you want to give

1261
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,359
people to say what they would do in the

1262
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,000
first six

1263
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,960
months of their job to make sure that

1264
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,599
they're successful so rachel

1265
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,280
i think it goes back to that interview

1266
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
when you're asking the questions what

1267
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,280
should

1268
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,359
what does success look like at 30 60 in

1269
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,319
90 days

1270
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,800
ask that hiring manager what you know

1271
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,319
how can i be successful

1272
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,160
go ahead and map out what does your

1273
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,520
success look like

1274
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,760
set goals set objectives and reach those

1275
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,640
goals don't

1276
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,560
like you said just sit back and be like

1277
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,920
oh i got this

1278
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,440
uh you really need to go ahead and make

1279
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
sure you're investing continue with that

1280
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,960
continued education

1281
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,480
um most companies have different

1282
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
databases that you're able to get into

1283
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
um and do additional learning so if you

1284
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,480
want to get a certification in this

1285
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,800
or certification in that or just want to

1286
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,640
you know sharpen up some skills

1287
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,319
there's all sorts of things so take it

1288
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,880
as you know be aggressive get out there

1289
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,560
and learn but i think the first step is

1290
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,760
really understanding

1291
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,599
how does that hiring manager measure

1292
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,359
success you already know the game plan

1293
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,440
so then you just execute that game plan

1294
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,359
lisa knowledge is power

1295
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,599
knowledge is power so rachel i agree

1296
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,280
continue your education i

1297
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
i'm continuing my education i'm always

1298
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
learning so learn on the job ask

1299
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,599
questions know the system know what goes

1300
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,280
on behind the scene i'm i'm process

1301
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,800
oriented so i want to know

1302
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,720
what happens before it comes to my desk

1303
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,240
and then what happens afterwards the

1304
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,440
onboarding i had to like

1305
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
how do you do your onboarding because

1306
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,119
we're not part of that so i wanted to

1307
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,720
learn behind the scenes

1308
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,400
comes to my desk and what happens

1309
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,839
afterwards

1310
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,000
and then certification education

1311
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,440
learning is very important

1312
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,920
you can it never stops you need to be

1313
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,079
fresh and knowledge is power is all that

1314
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,839
i can say just continue educating

1315
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:02,960
yourself

1316
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,400
there's never there's never a finish

1317
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,800
line

1318
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,760
when it comes to learning never um

1319
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,200
knowledge is power that's all i can say

1320
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,240
just remember that

1321
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,680

um also realize that you can go into

1347
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,800
career general

1348
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,440
and look at and just ask questions

1349
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,040
there'll be several of us who will be in

1350
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,760
there and

1351
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,720
happy to point you in the direction of

1352
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,800
you know do i need to have a college

1353
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,119
degree to go into cyber security or

1354
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,319
anything like that

1355
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,240
a lot of some new questions have been

1356
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,680
popping in and

1357
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,200
um i'm being told that i might have

1358
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,280
chance to answer one or two questions

1359
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,520
okay

1360
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,319
okay so we're going to approach this one

1361
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,440
and look at

1362
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,280
this is a an overall dilemma within the

1363
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,119
cyber security community

1364
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,480
and one that everyone has a different

1365
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,440
opinion

1366
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,400
because they operate from different

1367
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,599
employment

1368
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,720
cycles or not employment perspectives

1369
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,200
so rachel i'm going to ask you and i

1370
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,400
know that lisa will

1371
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,240
more than likely because she doesn't

1372
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,079
work in the federal contract space

1373
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,160
might have a slightly different answer

1374
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,760
so we're

1375
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,680
having a lot of people ask do they need

1376
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,599
to have a college degree

1377
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,800
to get into cyber security and is it

1378
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,880
possible to break into the industry

1379
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,160
without going to college so rachel

1380
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,920
from your perspective what is your

1381
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,359
answer

1382
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,119
i think as an industry overall we're

1383
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,040
seeing a shift in the education where

1384
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,240
before it was

1385
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,920
a non-negotiable you had to have the

1386
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,000
paper in order to get that interview

1387
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,520
what we're seeing now i mean i think you

1388
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,920
can look at across all planes

1389
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,160
that there's those relatable skills and

1390
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,520
relevant experience

1391
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,079
that are going to be transferable so

1392
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:48,960
most of our

1393
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
most if not all of our job descriptions

1394
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,800
say bachelor's degree

1395
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,200
or related experience um so we really

1396
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,119
are looking for that experience you you

1397
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,880
can't put a price on that when someone

1398
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,400
comes with that knowledge they know how

1399
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,359
to do things

1400
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,960
100 outside of you know medicine

1401
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,680
or law or things like that that

1402
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,839
definitely require that certain level of

1403
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,640
education

1404
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,400
um i think again and i don't i think

1405
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,920
this was happening even pre-covet

1406
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,400
there's really just been a change in the

1407
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,119
appetite

1408
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,119
and the way things are done where we're

1409
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,800
realizing some of those skills

1410
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,160
are better obtained through the school

1411
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,200
of hard knocks so absolutely 100

1412
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,800
not a requirement it is going to be

1413
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,720
something that we're going to look for

1414
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,480
um as there are great things that come

1415
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,800
along with it but we equally recognize

1416
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,640
that there is talent

1417
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,720
and skills that come outside of the the

1418
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,800
formal education process

1419
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,560
now rachel i'm i'm going to put you on

1420
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,480
the spot for that for just a

1421
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,319
moment if you're looking for a job that

1422
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,960
is with a government contractor or for

1423
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,839
an agency

1424
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,920
do we still have the requirement for

1425
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,520
those jobs that you have a college

1426
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,800
degree

1427
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
it varies so we're going to have some

1428
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,839
that do

1429
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,480
it just depends on that the requirements

1430
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,079
of those contracts so

1431
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,000
um most of them though we're really

1432
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,280
seeing that that shift

1433
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,800
where we're realizing there's different

1434
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,200
things that are coming up so i would say

1435
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,480
it's there's gonna be a smaller

1436
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,160
percentage that are gonna have a you

1437
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,040
know steadfast

1438
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,880
yes has to be where we're seeing the

1439
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,480
larger majority is starting to move to

1440
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:16,800
that

1441
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,839
related skills and lisa what are you

1442
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,440
seeing

1443
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,200
i think rachel's right that's what i'm

1444
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,440
seeing too um it was college degree

1445
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,520
absolutely had to have a degree

1446
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,000
but i've had conversations with um our

1447
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,599
ith our managers and saying you know

1448
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,040
what they didn't go to school they were

1449
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,000
already working on

1450
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,920
their computers they're you know already

1451
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,280
doing that

1452
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,200
um the hard knocks they were already

1453
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,560
working in the industry

1454
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,079
and did they focus on getting

1455
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,760
certifications instead of a

1456
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,680
a college education and that's what we

1457
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,280
really need we need

1458
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,319
um up to date i t people that are that

1459
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:50,560
are

1460
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,520
current i mean those individuals may not

1461
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,960
have ever gone to college or maybe they

1462
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,000
tried and they just weren't

1463
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,359
college ready um so yeah i think we're

1464
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,880
starting to open the doors a little bit

1465
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,480
wider we're going back

1466
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,280
to um not not education we rather have

1467
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,480
hands-on experience

1468
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,880
than the degree and i think we're gonna

1469
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,200
see more of that

1470
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,760
that sounds great so one thing that we

1471
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,720
should then address

1472
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,599
is to make sure that if you do have a

1473
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,480
home lab

1474
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,800
that you put that on your resume if you

1475
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,839
do are

1476
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,240
if you're part of a competition like any

1477
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,760
of the ctfs today

1478
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,680
it's not necessarily we need to know

1479
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,440
that you want a black badge

1480
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,920
we need to know that you did compete in

1481
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,599
the competition and how many of the

1482
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,960
competitions you did

1483
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,720
and what's interesting when we look at

1484
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,800
competitions a lot of people go into the

1485
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,240
competition

1486
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
they play it and then they go have a

1487
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,079
beer and do high fives

1488
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,280
take a few moments after any competition

1489
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,520
and write down in a journal or a notepad

1490
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,200
or something and say

1491
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,839
okay this is what the challenge was this

1492
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,599
was the time frame this was the

1493
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,240
resources i have these are the things

1494
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,760
um that we will do

1495
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,000
you know in the competition were you the

1496
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
leader were you the follower

1497
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
what kind of relationships did you build

1498
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,200
during that time

1499
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,000
and then use those whenever you go into

1500
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,240
an

1501
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,839
interview because you may not have the

1502
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,000
experience the work experience

1503
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,720
to say that you knew how to do this but

1504
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,640
i want to know that

1505
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,520
um you have seen this situation and a

1506
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,480
lot of people

1507
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,640
don't look at competitions as work

1508
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,839
experience but

1509
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,760
we're talking about a short time frame

1510
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
an urgent need people you've never

1511
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,040
worked with before

1512
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,960
and you have a goal to accomplish within

1513
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,559
a six to eight hour period

1514
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,000
if that doesn't sound like work

1515
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,160
experience i don't know what does

1516
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,640
so yeah there's that but be sure you're

1517
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,119
listing your competitions on your resume

1518
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,160
your home labs any of your community

1519
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,319
experience that you've done if you've

1520
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,079
set up a sock or a knock

1521
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,440
for a competition if or for a conference

1522
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,119
you know definitely know that but be

1523
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,119
sure you know how to present that

1524
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,760
in business terms not necessarily that

1525
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,839
you know i got the black badge at defcon

1526
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,680
that's not going to mean much to a

1527
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,680
recruiter you need to explain what that

1528
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,800
is

1529
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,160
so um we just had another question how

1530
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,839
can a person break the experience

1531
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,920
barrier if they're just starting out in

1532
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,480
it for an entry level mid-level jobs

1533
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,200
i think i just covered that by saying

1534
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,480
you know you're going to have the work

1535
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,680
experience

1536
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,440
but what are some of the other things

1537
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,359
that you're doing in the community are

1538
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,599
you doing any hacker boxes

1539
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,079
are you there are so many online

1540
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,400
competitions that you can be part of

1541
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,000
um tons of nonprofits need a lot of it

1542
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
support and help you can offer to be a

1543
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,119
volunteer

1544
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,880
so there are many different ways that

1545
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,800
you can build that experience

1546
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,880
but it is also as lisa was saying

1547
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,800
earlier your network

1548
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,920
you know it's um really important to

1549
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,960
make sure that you

1550
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,760
leverage your network to make sure that

1551
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,960
you're understanding the needs that

1552
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,280
they know about and that they can share

1553
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,240
with you

1554
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,960
and with that i know we have a few more

1555
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,800
questions but what i'm going to do is

1556
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,760
i'm going to

1557
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,440
jump into the career channel later and

1558
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,559

1559
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,240

1560
