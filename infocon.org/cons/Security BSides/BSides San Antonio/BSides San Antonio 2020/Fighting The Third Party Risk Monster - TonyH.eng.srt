1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,080
uh hello everybody good afternoon i hope

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,280

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,040
appreciate you guys sticking around with

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,399
me uh

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,840
after lunch uh we'll be talking today

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,559
about

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,799
third-party risk and what a monster has

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,320
become and how we can

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,160
get that under control um

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,320
first though uh let's just uh take a

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,439
look at the pieces

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,080
first we'll kind of do some backstory uh

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
how we got here

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,760
uh laid that lay the landscape and the

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,119
scenario

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,159
um by the way uh uh apologies to people

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,960
who aren't uh

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
role playing in d d geeks but there will

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,320
be lots of references throughout there i

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,600
think i had that in my

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,840
in my uh abstract so fair warning um

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,520
then we're going to look at uh what kind

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,440
of adventures we have in trying to

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
wrangle this beast

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,039
and finally let's level up with some

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,520
best practices for third-party risk

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,399
management

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
and how you can get it under control so

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,040
more cool which is sailing that's

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
actually an america's cup boat

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,600
that i'm sailing and uh my proudest

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,119
moment was when my band got to play

55
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:53,759
defcon

56
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,040
26 in 2018. uh that was super cool

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,119
if uh you caught us there doing our live

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
karaoke gig

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,960
um so enough about me

60
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
let's roll up a character and get this

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,639
show on the road

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
so how did we get here um

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,520
well outsourcing is a big part of it and

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
outsourcing is great

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
uh it brings us a lot of benefits um

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,800
and we kind of eased into this situation

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
we started outsourcing non-core

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
functions right

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
uh i mean if you look back 10 or 15

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,319
years ago

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,840
you know you really didn't if you

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,959
outsourced anything maybe it was

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,920
accounting

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
or something like that or sales

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
management but as time went on uh we

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,959
outsourced more and more functions to

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,400
the point where now many companies

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
actually

79
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
outsource significant parts of the it

80
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,879
portion of their core business um

81
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
you know a lot of banks now uh they use

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
a a

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
sas platform for their entire bank

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
function basically bank in a box

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
um a lot of hospitals are using

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,319
technology vendors for their key you

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,319
know it's not just a doctor with a

88
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,599
chart anymore they use a lot of

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,200
technology so they depend on those

90
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
vendors

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
it pretty much covers the entire um

92
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,879
it spectrum everything from your

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,239
hardware to your software uh

94
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
and even your infrastructure where it

95
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,920
used to be you felt like you had to own

96
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
the servers on the on the colo we've

97
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
slowly extracted that to the point where

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,159
a lot of that is run by other

99
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,440
companies um

100
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,159
and you know it's like i said there's a

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,760
lot of good reasons for that and we like

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,040
to have people do

103
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
the jobs that we don't really want to do

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
um a lot of

105
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
talented i.t people don't want to you

106
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,720
know maintain a mail server

107
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
or maintain a website and do all these

108
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,080
you know look through logs spend all

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,879
their time

110
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,879
especially if you're you're um you know

111
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,720
a single staff or a small staff

112
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
so you like to have that as a npc

113
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,480
non-player character to throw out there

114
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,840
to do those boring things

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,879
open up that door uh for me take that

116
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,280
danger

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,239
sorry sorry sorry to pause you tony real

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,120
fast

119
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,599
um i believe your screen share is not

120
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,720
showing right now

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,760
sorry about that everyone thanks for

122
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,239
your patience we'll move on but anyways

123
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,560
uh our npcs can be useful our vendors

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
are third parties but they can

125
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,959
uh what this has caused this massive

126
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,320
outsourcing move

127
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,960
is this tsunami of third parties with

128
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,160
the average enterprise

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,720
having about 67 vendors with some sort

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,639
of privileged access within your systems

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,840
and networks

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
you may have a few more you may have a

133
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
few less but this is what the average

134
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,720
enterprise has

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
on the flip side of that the average

136
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,199
technology vendor has 238

137
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,600
customers that they service and that

138
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,639
creates a

139
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,120
a motivation for hackers to go after

140
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,000
these guys

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
and we'll talk about that in a bit but

142
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,360
you can imagine why hack

143
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
one enterprise when you can hack one

144
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,479
company and get

145
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,159
hundreds of enterprises possibly

146
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,919
and this ends up with a lot of vendor

147
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,400
reps wandering around on your network

148
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
hopefully they're not wandering around

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
they're doing the jobs they were meant

150
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
to be but maybe they get bored maybe

151
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,759
they're malicious

152
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,360
or maybe a hacker's taken over their

153
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
account

154
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,160
they might have privileged accounts

155
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
maybe they're accessing it through some

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
simple form of access like a vpn with

157
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
not a lot of controls on it

158
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
they might be sharing credentials maybe

159
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
you've given them one login for the

160
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,000
entire company

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
so they don't have to be uh you don't

162
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
have to be putting different reps in and

163
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,400
now they've got that on a whiteboard in

164
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,800
their

165
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
in their main office maybe like in the

166
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
conference room by the window

167
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,039
um and as i was saying they're not just

168
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:37,680
into your

169
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
back end systems or your website anymore

170
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
they might be running critical systems

171
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
databases things like that uh they might

172
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,880
contain

173
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,639
sensitive data possibly regulated data

174
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,960
that you're supposed to protect so

175
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,320
that's a lot of folks

176
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
wandering around maybe not i'm always as

177
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
skilled as you might always think they

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
are

179
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
again it's great to have this help but

180
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
and hopefully some of these folks

181
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,479
are skilled uh maybe more than than your

182
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,919
companies that's why you've hired them

183
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,520
but they might also hire some new folks

184
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,880
and be training them

185
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,840
uh and a newbie rep can get you in a lot

186
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
of trouble there's your first level

187
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
character

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,479
joining your party uh and they can get

189
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,160
you in a lot of trouble by uh

190
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,919
alerting the monster knocking down the

191
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,520
wrong door or letting a hacker

192
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
in that door

193
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,199
and this perfect storm really has

194
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,160
resulted in a lot of major breaches that

195
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,039
are related

196
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,960
to some third party that come in via a

197
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,400
vendor or a third party

198
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,360
um this is just a short list but um

199
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
target was kind of the uh

200
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,000
er large breach back a while ago

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
uh you all probably heard about it when

202
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
it happened uh

203
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,039
hackers got in it was a christmas time

204
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,720
and stole about 41 million

205
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
credit card records it was a big deal

206
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,400
the company lost a ton of stock value in

207
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,520
sales and

208
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
most of the c-suite ended up getting

209
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,520
cleared out what you may not know is

210
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,560
this was caused by a lowly hvac vendor

211
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
a company that was really supposed to

212
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
only work on cooling systems

213
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,479
was in a project management system and

214
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,599
hackers took over

215
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,080
or got into that vendor got into the

216
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
network

217
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
it wasn't properly segmented so they

218
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,720
were able to jump onto payment systems

219
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,280
and get

220
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,639
get those credit cards a little more

221
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,199
recently uh this last year

222
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,560
lab corp and quest diagnostics probably

223
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,960
uh

224
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
have gotten a test from these companies

225
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,240
these are the largest companies that do

226
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,280
medical tests

227
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,720
if you've got any kind of blood work

228
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,319
chances are you visited one of these

229
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,680
companies for it

230
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,319
they were hacked 20 million plus records

231
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:40,800
uh

232
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
and this included their billing

233
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
information of their customers and

234
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,319
services

235
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,840
rendered so if you can imagine um

236
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
you know what kind of test you were

237
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
getting maybe it was an aids test or a

238
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,479
drug test or a

239
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,280
cancer test very sensitive uh that phi

240
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,400
information that if you're in health

241
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
care you have to protect

242
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
and the way they got hacked is through a

243
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,560
collections agency again pretty low tech

244
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,879
seeming uh not something you think of as

245
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
being a critical vector

246
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,160
but they did have all that information

247
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,919
they got hacked therefore those two

248
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,879
companies plus several others got hacked

249
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
capital one was also in the news last

250
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
year

251
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,759
they had a online application form

252
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,879
and it got hacked 100 million

253
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,520
credit card applications got stolen and

254
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,199
again imagine what's on that it's pretty

255
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
much your entire financial history so

256
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
your social security number how much you

257
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
make where you work

258
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,320
et cetera et cetera very valuable

259
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
information to identity thieves

260
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,360
and this happened through a broken aws

261
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,399
application firewall so um

262
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
again the fingers are being pointed and

263
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
capital one says it's aws's problem adbs

264
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,600
of course

265
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,920
using their shared responsibility model

266
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
says no that's your responsibility

267
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
and that legal fight will go on for a

268
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
while but capital one is the one in the

269
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
news capital one is the one getting sued

270
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,080
for all those records uh getting

271
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
breached um

272
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,279
another one uh this myfitnesspal.com app

273
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,680
and

274
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
you may not recognize that particular

275
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
name but they run a lot of these uh

276
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
track my bike ride track my run type of

277
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,640
apps they have

278
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
a bunch of them and they got hacked

279
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
their customers emails usernames and

280
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,519
passwords were stolen

281
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,120
and if you think about what's stored on

282
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,279
these phi personal health information so

283
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
it's going to be maybe your heart rate

284
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,360
how much you weigh pretty sensitive

285
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
information

286
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
um and that was 150 million records like

287
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
that's half the country

288
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
in terms of numbers and the way these

289
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,519
hackers got in is through

290
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,760
a security vulnerability in an acquired

291
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,120
business unit

292
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,920
so um the lesson here is if you're

293
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,959
acquiring companies

294
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
or maybe being acquired you definitely

295
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
need to do your due diligence

296
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
because you don't want to acquire their

297
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,880
vulnerabilities

298
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
and that happens quite a bit and my

299
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,320
final example

300
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,839
is also last year this was um

301
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,320
what i call a mass ransomware attack

302
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
where uh

303
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
they launched attacks on 22 separate

304
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,040
small texas cities

305
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
uh and this affected their municipal

306
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,959
sort of management systems their law

307
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,040
enforcement systems 9-1-1

308
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,240
payment utilities or utility payments um

309
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,519
all the core things that

310
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,760
that a small government does was shut

311
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
down and demanded ransom

312
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
uh they launched it simultaneously so

313
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
that it would be very hard

314
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,480
uh for um these folks to to react and it

315
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
would draw a lot of resources in fact

316
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,440
the um the governor actually declared a

317
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
small state of emergency because the

318
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
texas rangers security

319
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,079
cyber security unit had to come in and

320
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,920
help um

321
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,279
we don't really know how many records

322
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
were possibly stolen but

323
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,640
thousands of citizens obviously were

324
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
impacted if you needed to call 9-1-1

325
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,959
or needed to access a property record

326
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,320
you were out of luck maybe you're

327
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
closing on a home

328
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,120
uh pretty pretty massive several more

329
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
have happened like this in louisiana and

330
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
several other states

331
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
and this came in through a managed

332
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,560
service provider they all used jointly

333
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,320
happened to be a company that that ran

334
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
i.t departments for small

335
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,320
uh police offices so if you're in a

336
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,760
really small town and you just have a

337
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,959
couple officers

338
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,160
maybe they're just out there giving

339
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,800
tickets at the speed trap

340
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
but uh you don't have an i.t guy and

341
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
they would run the i.t for you well

342
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
turns out they weren't using mfa to get

343
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,000
into those remote systems

344
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,880
it got hacked and they got into all the

345
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,800
other city systems as well so

346
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,040
that was pretty bad and again this is

347
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
just a representative example there are

348
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,079
hundreds and thousands of more uh out

349
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,200
there

350
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,560
that you can look at

351
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
here's an example i think that i'd like

352
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,320
to bring up to identify a

353
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
emerging vector uh hacked by fish well

354
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
i mean real fish uh this casino had a

355
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
large fish tank like you see behind

356
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
their

357
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
their uh check-in desk sometimes and uh

358
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,639
of course i doubt they were thinking

359
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,320
this is a cyber risk when they when they

360
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
put that in right one of the fish gonna

361
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
jump out of the

362
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,360
of the tank or whatever but it did have

363
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,320
an ip

364
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,560
sensor in there ip based sensor that

365
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,920
would check the temperature

366
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,120
and let the servicing company know when

367
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,880
uh when that needed to be serviced

368
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,200
well they got hacked they got into that

369
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,639
got access to the network

370
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,240
jumped over onto the payment systems and

371
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
of course got the valuable stuff

372
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,040
uh again i doubt the it people ever

373
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,240
thought or worried about this little

374
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,600
fish tank

375
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,040
may not even know about it for that

376
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,200
matter so that just gives you

377
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
a feel for this world of iot of internet

378
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,200
of things

379
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
and how much of a threat it's becoming i

380
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,279
think it's approaching

381
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,959
the threat of the servers and

382
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,560
workstations because we just have so

383
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,399
many of these devices

384
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,920
y'all may have heard of the i don't have

385
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
a slide on it but the ripple

386
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,120
20 uh or 2.0 however you say it

387
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
announcement about two weeks ago they

388
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
found a massive vulnerability

389
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,079
actually 19 of them in this ip stack

390
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,839
built by a company called trek

391
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,040
you've probably never heard of them

392
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,600
because they build tcpip stacks for

393
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,839
iot devices like webcams and things like

394
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,079
that uh

395
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,839
and it literally affects hundreds of

396
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,519
millions of devices we don't really know

397
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,360
the full number because we don't know

398
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,490
who all used this this um

399
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,720
[Music]

400
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
uh stack and even there's companies that

401
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,639
use

402
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
equipment that use equipment that used

403
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,120
it so uh we'll talk later about the

404
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,680
supply chain problem but um we don't

405
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,120
really even know the full scope and this

406
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,240
is going to be a problem for

407
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
years and years trying to get just this

408
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,519
one

409
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,839
issue resolved

410
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,959
so i mentioned earlier uh the attraction

411
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,560
of hacking a vendor or

412
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
someone that works with a bunch of

413
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,800
customers and has access to their i.t

414
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,519
and uh there has been a concentrated

415
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,399
concerted

416
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,079
targeting of vendors and managed service

417
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
providers because the hackers really see

418
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
this as a force multiplier right

419
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
again i can hack one company and get out

420
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,240
possibly get access to hundreds of

421
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
networks

422
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
probably some some big people too

423
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,120
because a lot of these technology

424
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,440
vendors are smaller than their customers

425
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,720
so i might be a little no-name uh a

426
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
hvac vendor but you've never heard of

427
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,079
them

428
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,120
uh but they got into target and that's

429
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
the kind of thing

430
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,959
they like and these managed service

431
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,120
providers provide services across a wide

432
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
spectrum i mean it services is probably

433
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
the most common but

434
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,320
security web hosting like your wp engine

435
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
and wix uh networking services mdm

436
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,639
uh security monitoring companies like

437
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,800
alert logic and secure pipe

438
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,320
uh data storage a la the uh

439
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,519
amazon s3 and so forth uh and you know

440
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,320
the big

441
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,079
big uh state actors the apts as we call

442
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:48,399
them

443
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,800
advanced persistent threats are using

444
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
this extensively china

445
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
uh has hacked into at least 45 msps and

446
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
tech companies and they have actually

447
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,279
specially designed tools to go after

448
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,279
these these type of vendors

449
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,760
uh and again that that texas uh city

450
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,279
ransomware attack was

451
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,480
packed through an msp

452
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
here's uh just a specific example now

453
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,920
during covid

454
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,360
they've even focused tighter on

455
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,959
healthcare msps

456
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,680
uh nice guys that they are um this

457
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,399
quampears

458
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,160
malware uh targets uh healthcare msps

459
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,199
uh and you know they're not completely

460
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,079
heartless though

461
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,839
some of these ransomware folks have been

462
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,000
offering discounts if you get uh

463
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,680
your healthcare organization gets what

464
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
nice guys i mean i really appreciate

465
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
them giving a discount to

466
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,519
uh our hospitals but yeah it's it's

467
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,800
pretty bad and they they

468
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
um i'm being facetious of course they

469
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
take advantage

470
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,759
of uh these situations and will kick you

471
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,320
when you're down

472
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,880
and you know uh you may think that uh

473
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
well i've got all these

474
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,759
contract clauses and they're going to be

475
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,600
liable for my breach and i've locked

476
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,519
them up tight in the contract phase

477
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,120
that's great you should definitely do

478
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,920
that but in a large breach like some of

479
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,560
these

480
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,399
uh your your third part of your small

481
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,519
vendor is probably going to go out of

482
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,800
business they're not going to be able to

483
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,680
shoulder

484
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,040
um the the costs and and the

485
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,120
lawsuits that you're going to endure so

486
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,680
in the case of the quest diagnostics

487
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,320
and lab corp hack the company that

488
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
caused it

489
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
they went bankrupt right away so that's

490
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,959
going to be on labcorp diagnost

491
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,720
diagnostics and those other companies to

492
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
shoulder the costs and

493
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
the burdens

494
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,839
and uh i spoke earlier about the vendor

495
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,040
of your vendor's vendor and this is

496
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
called nth party risk so

497
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,079
we're not just talking about the third

498
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,920
party we're talking about

499
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
uh the fourth party in the fifth party

500
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,560
um you can see that kind of

501
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,199
webbing out from there so example you

502
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,480
might have a vendor

503
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
that does something for you they host

504
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,079
some system you use but they actually

505
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,759
store that on aws

506
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,199
or some other colo provider et cetera or

507
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,360
they might use some tool or something

508
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
that's another company that stores your

509
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,799
data in some place you're not aware of

510
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,559
and again it only takes a breach of one

511
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,319
of those people in the chain

512
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,079
possibly for the bad actors to work

513
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,520
their way through

514
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,000
um so you may end up feeling kind of

515
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
like this fellow here

516
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
uh surrounded by a thousand orcs and

517
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,559
getting attacked

518
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,039
and and really surrounded on all sides

519
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
by the way extra credit uh for uh

520
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
knowing who this where this picture

521
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,720
comes from you can put that in the chat

522
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,600
if you want

523
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,880
uh but um that is how you might feel

524
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
when you're trying to manage this

525
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,559
like this massive web of third parties

526
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,799
so what we have is a bunch of different

527
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,640
kinds of risks uh that these third

528
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
parties bring

529
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,400
um the operational risk right so these

530
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
hospitals and

531
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
uh some of these power plants and

532
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,360
manufacturing companies

533
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
uh ransomware or any company really

534
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,559
takes them down

535
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,559
that's time and money right um

536
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,080
especially when you're talking about

537
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
key infrastructure and healthcare where

538
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
it could be actually a

539
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
life critical so uh you don't want to be

540
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,200
down in those situations and that's what

541
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
the hackers know and that's now why

542
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,760
they're going after

543
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
on using ransomware more and more as the

544
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
primary attack

545
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,160
obviously security risk when you have

546
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,280
all these users

547
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
uh connecting into your network and

548
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,280
systems hundreds maybe thousands because

549
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,640
if you have dozens or hundreds of

550
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,520
vendors

551
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,679
they're going to have more than one rep

552
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,200
and you might have even thousands of

553
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
users wandering

554
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,080
around your network doing different

555
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,679
things

556
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,760
uh the money uh for these types of

557
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,720
breaches

558
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,000
is significant uh the average uh

559
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,400
cost is up six point four percent over

560
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,679
last year to three point eight six

561
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,559
million

562
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,240
that's average even the smallest

563
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,600
breaches i can tell you

564
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,559
every breach i listed in my in my table

565
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:46,960
there

566
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,440
is is a tens of millions if not hundreds

567
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,480
of millions

568
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,840
of breach and some of these are now

569
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,440
reaching into the billions when you talk

570
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,360
about the cost of the lawsuits

571
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,520
and the regulatory fines

572
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,679
and if you're in a regulated industry

573
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,600
you're also looking at a regulatory risk

574
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
so not only might you be hit with

575
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,679
money fines and lawsuits but you might

576
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,039
get shut down or face

577
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,919
operational uh limitations and so forth

578
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,919
like with banks you have your charter

579
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,400
uh you can get sighted and hospitals the

580
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,679
same thing so

581
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,799
it's not just money it's it's uh uh

582
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,640
the regulators can come in and shut you

583
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
down and even find you criminally liable

584
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
if you're uh you know if you're

585
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,360
criminally negligent

586
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,679
so all right we know the problem is big

587
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,600
let's sit down let's form a party let's

588
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,360
uh let's solve this problem let's go

589
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,240
after it

590
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,760
uh what are we looking at what are the

591
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,919
challenges

592
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,280
well it turns out there's a bunch of

593
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,960
them if it was easy

594
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,240
it would be it would have been fixed a

595
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,320
long time ago

596
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,400
so here are some of the barriers to a

597
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,919
good solution to this third party

598
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,640
problem

599
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,679
um well first of all money and resources

600
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,480
uh a lot of i.t and security departments

601
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,320
still don't have third-party

602
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,159
management third-party risk management

603
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,919
budgets you have to to make it up

604
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,000
elsewhere or find it somewhere or do it

605
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,679
in house

606
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,840
you might be using the wrong tools for

607
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,960
the solution

608
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
uh maybe you're just using the same vpn

609
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,720
that your your employees use

610
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,559
i'll talk about why that's a bad idea in

611
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,840
a bit but

612
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,280
it's not necessarily designed for um

613
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,919
letting people outside your company uh

614
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,440
they who aren't employees into it

615
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,640
or uh each vendor has their own tool so

616
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
they're then stuck with uh

617
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,440
having to manage learn and support there

618
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,159
are different

619
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
uh support platforms there's no standard

620
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
you got vendor managers uh not you know

621
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,960
all over the place both in

622
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
physically separate and logic logical

623
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
different divisions

624
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
uh so you've got all these folks who are

625
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,280
managing needing to get people in

626
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
uh that aren't necessarily part of uit

627
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
department or even

628
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,120
in your at your uh physical location and

629
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,480
finally once you once you do

630
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,159
come up if you do come up with a

631
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,880
technological solution or a process or

632
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
policy you've got to get the vendors to

633
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,600
buy into it not so hard if you're a big

634
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
company and they're a small company but

635
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,000
if you're

636
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
us if they're the vendor is a ge medical

637
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,080
or someone

638
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,840
uh it's going to be pretty hard to to

639
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,760
move them off of what they're using

640
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,679
uh into whatever you want to have them

641
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,120
do so you end up with this the sort of

642
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,039
teeter-totter of needs

643
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,360
where as you increase security the

644
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,880
efficiency

645
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,640
of those vendors go down and you might

646
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,799
get complaints from internal

647
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,200
uh stakeholders saying hey i can't get

648
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,880
this app up and running um

649
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
they can't get into services i'm sure

650
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,000
you've all heard that we need to give

651
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,400
them

652
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,840
you know wide open access get rid of the

653
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,440
firewall rules we just got to have this

654
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,559
thing up

655
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,880
and then also you have your vendors who

656
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,280
um you know they're typically graded

657
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,360
uh and paid on on things like time to

658
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
resolution and they have slas they have

659
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,159
to meet

660
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,919
security is not always one of them so um

661
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,760
and you can build that in this in the

662
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,520
contract phase uh

663
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,480
but it's not always in there so uh as

664
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,000
their requirements get met

665
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,280
some of yours drop off

666
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,000
and that's before we get to compliance

667
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,480
right we get the real security done

668
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
but then we got to satisfy the auditors

669
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,919
and it really matters to pretty much

670
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,840
everyone now 85 percent

671
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,320
of companies uh state that they have to

672
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,679
get third parties to

673
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,840
comply with their policies for part of

674
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,280
their regulations

675
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,520
and if yesterday or a year or two ago

676
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
you were in a regulated industry you

677
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,799
most likely are now

678
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,200
because of the privacy laws right the

679
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,000
gdpr for eu and now we have the ccpa in

680
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
california

681
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,600
so you may have been able to brush off

682
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,840
gdpr concerns oh we don't do

683
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,960
business in europe etc but everyone

684
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,679
probably has

685
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,440
does business with a california company

686
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,039
or california customers

687
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,039
that means you do have to comply

688
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,400
so this adds up to a lot of time the

689
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,919
average organization

690
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,960
spends 17 000 uh personnel hours per

691
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,320
year complying with

692
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,440
various regulations audits etc if you're

693
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,360
in the finance industry you know

694
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,200
that you're getting auditors different

695
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,360
auditors in and out almost every week

696
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
i saw that when i was in that side of

697
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
the business

698
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,240
so this adds up to about nine ftes

699
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,960
which we'd all love to have in rit or

700
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
security department

701
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,520
um to do other things to do more

702
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,720
productive things than just pull

703
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,840
paperwork but

704
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,439
that's the reality we have to do it

705
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,360
so another problem we know the

706
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,159
challenges

707
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,640
let's let's see about leveling up here

708
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,159
and how can we leverage

709
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,320
uh some best practices for dealing with

710
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,879
this risk

711
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,159
well first of all there's a lot of

712
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,159
regulations and your your organization

713
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,440
may fall under one or many of these

714
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
uh so you might have a health care

715
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
organization where you have hipaa

716
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,600
and high tech but you also do credit

717
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,880
cards you got pci

718
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,840
maybe you're uh you do gdpr uh you

719
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,039
probably have to do

720
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,919
ccpa for california folks so there's a

721
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,679
lot of regulations which have different

722
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,000
stipulations different levels of

723
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,120
of uh stringent uh

724
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
things so you know if you try to tackle

725
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,480
them one at a time

726
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,720
you might end up like this where you're

727
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
arguing and

728
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,279
i know we need to do this for pci i'm

729
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,279
going to do that for gdpr

730
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,559
um but you know you can really boil most

731
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,640
of these down to

732
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,000
three things uh you need to identify

733
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,039
on authenticate properly you need to

734
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,559
control access

735
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,640
and you need to record an audit much of

736
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,240
this is similar to what you want to do

737
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
with your employees but there's some

738
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,880
important distinctions

739
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,279
i'm going to talk about those so let's

740
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,240
dive in

741
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,200
and see what kind of best practices uh

742
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,159
and uh

743
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
spells if you will that you can cast it

744
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,960
to to get control of these vendors

745
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,480
um identifying your vendors this is the

746
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,400
this is the most important part there's

747
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,320
your identity identify spell

748
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
if you're familiar with the dnd

749
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,559
um problem is that most companies don't

750
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,240
even know how many vendors they have

751
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
coming in 37 percent

752
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
aren't even sure not only who their

753
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
vendors are but how many they have

754
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
and here's the thing uh what i've seen

755
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
is most companies who are sure of it

756
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,960
are wrong uh they might say we have 10

757
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
vendors or we have 20 vendors

758
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,480
and come to find out they have 100 and

759
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,320
it's almost universal i've never seen

760
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,760
someone have fewer vendors they always

761
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,000
have

762
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
more because you've got sas vendors

763
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,679
you've got shadow i.t you've got a lot

764
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,360
of things going on that you didn't have

765
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,039
10 years ago but the best practice is to

766
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,760
move towards

767
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,360
doing a comprehensive list of vendors um

768
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,080
and uh you know i recommend starting

769
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,000
literally with the general ledger

770
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,799
uh and seeing who you pay that's not

771
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,919
going to get all of them by the way

772
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,880
because you might have

773
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
people writing off things on credit

774
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
cards on their expense report like

775
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,360
even aws fees infrastructure on a credit

776
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,799
card it's very hard to track down if

777
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,240
they don't report it

778
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,880
um but you want to end up with who they

779
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,440
are

780
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,720
what are they doing for you and they

781
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
might be doing multiple things if it's a

782
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,440
large company

783
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,000
and what are their access needs in other

784
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,640
words

785
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,840
is it uh remote access is it on site

786
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,480
access

787
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,760
is it privileged access uh so on and so

788
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,039
forth

789
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,279
and and you know this isn't something

790
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,880
that's a one and done it evolves

791
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
obviously you pick up new vendors things

792
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,600
change

793
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
um again i've never seen anyone on the

794
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
first round get everybody

795
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,120
but as you refine it as you refine your

796
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,960
process and get policies and procedures

797
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
into place

798
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,240
you can start to get closer to what you

799
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,080
believe is the true number the actual

800
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,879
number of vendors

801
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,520
another thing that that i recommend as a

802
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,320
best practice

803
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,400
is is not trying to manage these folks

804
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
like your regular users and active

805
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,039
directory

806
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,440
i know a lot of folks do this uh because

807
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
it's there it's already a process

808
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,960
but you end up with something like this

809
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,120
where you have you know vendor acme sean

810
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,799
vendor acme max

811
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,880
uh it gets really unruly after even a

812
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
couple of vendors

813
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,760
um it gets out of date and uh

814
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
you know after some point you have more

815
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,600
vendors and employees in your a.d

816
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,279
or again the naming conventions break

817
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,840
down so uh it may work for a while but

818
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,360
it doesn't really scale well

819
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,559
and there's some other issues with that

820
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,480
too and i'll talk about that in a minute

821
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,279
uh generic accounts if you get anything

822
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,640
out of this presentation this is

823
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,520
probably the

824
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,720
the gem um you know having those those

825
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
shared accounts those acme corp

826
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,640
uh you know you don't want to sit there

827
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,240
and have to manage all their people

828
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,919
coming and going so you give them acme

829
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,720
corp

830
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,320
and again that gets posted on a

831
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
whiteboard shared on emails or sticky

832
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,200
notes

833
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,480
and that that is passed around uh

834
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,960
you know it's just not great and it'll

835
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,000
also take you out of

836
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
compliance with a lot of regulations

837
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,360
especially pci

838
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,679
and things what you want to move towards

839
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,559
is identifying

840
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,480
every individual who needs access to

841
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,799
your systems you need a process that

842
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,960
creates these accounts efficiently

843
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,559
gives them the least privilege they need

844
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,399
and then then off boards them

845
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,000
when they're terminated as quickly as

846
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,399
possible that's again that's the gold

847
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,600
standard that's what you want to move

848
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,918
towards

849
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,520
mfa multi-factor authentication this is

850
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,799
probably number two

851
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,720
as far as the most important things in

852
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,960
this

853
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,200
and this is becoming a standard now uh

854
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,279
in regulatory frameworks so

855
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,919
again pci and a number of things he just

856
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,039
will require this

857
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,679
uh so if you haven't moved towards mfa

858
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,360
at least for privileged accounts

859
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,320
highly highly recommend it it's a great

860
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,880
uh

861
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,960
way to kill a uh it's a great thing in

862
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,159
the kill chain

863
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,760
and if you're gonna do it try to use a

864
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
standard like totp

865
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,919
so if the vendor uses uh authy or google

866
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,360
authenticator whatever they use

867
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,399
it's gonna work with your system

868
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,240
and uh because yeah different vendors

869
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,440
are going to have different ways of

870
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,799
doing it

871
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,600
so again the more standard based you can

872
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,080
the better

873
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,279
okay we've got them in we know they're

874
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,279
who they are and so forth but

875
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,720
let's make sure that they're still

876
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,880
employed there right we talked about the

877
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
uh how we're going to verify them so how

878
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,159
we're going to get them into the system

879
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,760
that onboarding process is very

880
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,799
important

881
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
and then i ideally automated and then

882
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:26,799
how do we

883
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,880
uh off-board them how do we know when

884
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,559
that person's quit because we're not in

885
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,559
their hr department right

886
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,640
we uh we need to know and get them out

887
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,000
of our system as soon as possible

888
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,440
all right number two is uh control

889
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,600
um you see there the control weather

890
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,640
spell

891
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,240
i wish we could control weather

892
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,760
especially in texas

893
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,679
uh oh if only there were controlled

894
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,440
vendor spell but here's the best

895
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,000
practices

896
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
to get you to that um

897
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,320
so again i talked about up front a lot

898
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,279
of this is

899
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,960
happens before the vendor becomes a

900
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,240
vendor when they're still being

901
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,399
evaluated

902
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,000
the more you can get into their

903
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,600
contracts or the more you can uncover

904
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,840
why you're evaluating them the better

905
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,000
um you know what access method is going

906
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
to be used require them to use yours

907
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,880
or at least know what it is and and

908
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,760
approve it

909
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
um require those individual accounts

910
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,200
you're not going to give them a generic

911
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,760
account

912
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,279
require mfa um require them to sync up

913
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,000
with you until

914
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,200
when when reps are terminated um require

915
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,919
them to to

916
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,919
notify you if they have an incident and

917
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,440
and so and also if they

918
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,720
are putting your data if they're

919
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,240
outsourcing if they have downstream

920
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,679
vendors that's handling your data they

921
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,120
need to let you know

922
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,640
all this is stuff that if you do it in

923
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,320
the contract you have recourse

924
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,840
if you try to do it after the fact it's

925
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,440
a negotiation and they don't really have

926
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,840
to say

927
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,520
yes

928
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,640
um you also uh again once you onboard

929
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,840
these folks you want to

930
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,200
you know you want to have a paper trail

931
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,039
or at least a documentation trail

932
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,600
to know uh you know who approved this

933
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,880
what department what's the

934
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,679
application owner and then who approved

935
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,320
it

936
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,080
who set it up and then they have access

937
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
so you want to be able to unwind that

938
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,880
that process

939
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
and roll it backwards so if there's a

940
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,000
problem

941
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,159
you know where it came from

942
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,880
uh again uh you want to make sure this

943
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,720
vendor is actually secure

944
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,519
uh are they using current and managed uh

945
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,799
endpoint protection

946
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
uh especially if they have reps that

947
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,320
work at home are they using

948
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,399
you know free antivirus or any antivirus

949
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,760
at all

950
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
are they using the latest and greatest

951
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,360
encryption so forth are they basically

952
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,880
meeting the same standards that you need

953
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,440
to meet

954
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,320
and can they prove it

955
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,080
i recommend especially if you have a lot

956
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,360
of vendors that when you're doing your

957
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,039
risk assessments you tier them

958
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,279
because not all vendors are the same

959
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,720
your janitorial vendor

960
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,240
carries some risk with them it's mainly

961
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,720
a physical risk um

962
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,120
but they may aren't the same as

963
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,200
necessarily as an administrative company

964
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,720
managing your database

965
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
so put them into tiers and depending on

966
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,840
what they have access to

967
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,279
and what level of access they have and

968
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,960
this will allow you to

969
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,640
develop different systems and different

970
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,720
levels of controls for different tiers

971
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,840
of vendors

972
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,120
least privilege we practice this with

973
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
our employees hopefully

974
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,559
so we should definitely be practicing it

975
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,480
with our vendors and third parties

976
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,000
all the more so um you really really

977
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,679
really don't want to just throw your net

978
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,600
vendors on the network with a vpn that's

979
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,880
unsegmented

980
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,919
um that is the recipe for disaster it's

981
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:36,399
been

982
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,640
the the main technique for a lot of

983
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
these hacks

984
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,640
uh if you're just handing them a vpn uh

985
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,919
like your employees

986
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,640
you know i always like to say a vpn is

987
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,039
like an ethernet plug that's extended

988
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,399
you just let them plug right into your

989
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,320
network and hopefully they'll work on

990
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,000
the servers that you've

991
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,080
you allow them to but nothing is really

992
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,200
to stop them from

993
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,760
scanning the network uh leapfrogging

994
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,000
onto other systems this is pretty much

995
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
a element of almost every successful

996
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,200
deep hack so

997
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,440
um make sure that they have least

998
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,039
privileged access both from a network

999
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,440
standpoint from a host standpoint

1000
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,399
even from application ports on specific

1001
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,439
server standpoint

1002
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,360
control so i talked about earlier you've

1003
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,840
got these

1004
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,000
application vendors and you've got your

1005
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,399
it people and your security people

1006
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,200
and uh if the it people are just being

1007
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,320
handed uh

1008
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,600
they need to get access to an

1009
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,799
application that they don't really

1010
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,120
understand right they're not the expert

1011
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,440
they're just the administrator of access

1012
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,840
they will tend to to do a less granular

1013
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,120
because they don't know and they don't

1014
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,039
want that application vendor

1015
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,360
coming back to them or manager or

1016
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,960
vendors saying hey we don't have access

1017
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,399
got to troubleshoot this so they might

1018
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,519
be

1019
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,919
have a tendency to hand out more uh

1020
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,600
privileged or super easy access than

1021
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:55,919
they

1022
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,559
than they might normally if you let the

1023
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,159
application owners

1024
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,120
delegate delegate down to them they tend

1025
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,919
to understand

1026
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,240
this users just needs view only and so

1027
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,840
forth they understand the application

1028
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,560
so this is a fairly new innovation here

1029
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
where there's technology it's called

1030
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,679
credential vaulting

1031
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,159
that allows you to not have to hand out

1032
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,560
a password and a login to

1033
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,760
to a user to get privileged access

1034
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,000
really all they get is access to a lobby

1035
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,679
and they can check out that privileged

1036
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,280
access for the time they need it

1037
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,119
then check it back in they never

1038
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,399
actually have the login

1039
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,800
privileged login and that's pretty

1040
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,159
powerful

1041
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,040
because it uh they if that again that

1042
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
vendor rep writes it down and leaves the

1043
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,000
company they can't

1044
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,520
necessarily try to come in from a

1045
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
different angle um

1046
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,560
and uh also single sign-on things like

1047
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,320
this where you can

1048
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,079
turn off their access with a single

1049
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,400
switch and if you can again

1050
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,320
push that that authentication down to

1051
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,599
the vendor

1052
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,960
into their ad usually companies

1053
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,160
when they terminate someone that's the

1054
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,320
first thing to go is their

1055
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,560
network access and if it's federated

1056
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,240
down to them then it's going to turn it

1057
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
off pretty much immediately you don't

1058
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,480
have to have

1059
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,640
a sync up process it just goes away and

1060
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,920
they take it out of their

1061
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,800
directory service

1062
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,920
so final piece of this three-legged

1063
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,400
stool

1064
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,160
is is auditing and reviewing um there's

1065
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,000
not such a spell in d d so i'm using the

1066
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
scrying spell but you want to be able to

1067
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,720
keep an eye on things

1068
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,000
once you've got them in you've given

1069
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,480
them least privilege now let's make sure

1070
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,839
they are actually doing what they're

1071
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,640
supposed to be doing

1072
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,240
um so a basic audit you know this might

1073
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
be like a vpn log is gonna you'll know

1074
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,880
like

1075
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,920
destination and source ips

1076
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,119
maybe the username uh maybe a session

1077
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,520
start and stop time doesn't really tell

1078
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,160
you much

1079
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,880
uh other than someone connected and

1080
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,240
maybe did something

1081
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,000
but you want to get more granular with

1082
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
your your uh third-party logs you want

1083
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,800
to know

1084
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,280
who is the authorizer for this access

1085
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,560
why are they connecting

1086
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,400
is this regular course of business this

1087
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
is what they do every day or is this an

1088
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,200
emergent uh

1089
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,720
you know they're trying to fix some some

1090
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,520
problem is there a ticket number in a

1091
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,119
case system that you have so you can go

1092
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,960
to that and see what's going on

1093
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,079
um and ideally this is the gold the holy

1094
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:26,960
grail

1095
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,560
of vendor audit would be to have your

1096
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,960
keystroke logs and your video capture of

1097
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
any graphical sessions

1098
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,560
you probably wouldn't do this for your

1099
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,240
internal people it's just too many but

1100
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,440
with vendors

1101
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,040
again that just gives you an extra level

1102
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,560
of control

1103
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,119
to detect any problem uh while it's

1104
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,720
happening before it happens

1105
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
or worst case if something has happened

1106
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,560
you can sort of uh

1107
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,320
put humpty dumpty back together again by

1108
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,839
backing up and seeing what they actually

1109
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,720
did forensically

1110
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,760
so um if you're looking and you're

1111
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,359
reviewing audit logs

1112
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,280
um if you have them in a bunch of

1113
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,040
different places that it gets really

1114
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,000
difficult

1115
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,800
to to put the the puzzle together and if

1116
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,520
you've ever done

1117
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
this if you've ever tried to pull wrap

1118
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,200
logs firewall logs and then

1119
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,800
windows event logs and so forth

1120
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,520
it can be a real hard thing to get them

1121
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,079
all synced

1122
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,599
up and see what's actually happening so

1123
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,359
having a single sort of source of truth

1124
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,200
for your third-party access and

1125
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,079
an activity makes it uh a lot easier to

1126
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,520
see the forest for the trees you can

1127
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,720
kind of see what's going on

1128
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,359
see if it's benign or uh you know if

1129
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,000
it's not

1130
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,200
you can investigate further

1131
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,320
and if you're going to keep all this

1132
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,240
great audit and

1133
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,760
log data you got to look at it

1134
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,839
so a lot of folks only look at their

1135
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,359
logs when there's a problem

1136
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,160
when they think there's an issue and

1137
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,440
that's probably too late you want to

1138
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,079
have a regular review process

1139
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,359
you want to have you know automatic

1140
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,520
notifications when certain things happen

1141
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,359
tripwires if you will and things like

1142
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,760
that so you don't have to

1143
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,599
uh go to your logs after the things

1144
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,119
already happened and at that point it's

1145
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,560
too late this is the reason why

1146
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,520
over half of breaches are discovered by

1147
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,960
outside sources so

1148
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,440
you get an email or call from the fbi or

1149
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,560
some friendly

1150
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,720
white hat hacker or something saying hey

1151
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,560
find your data in this paste bin do you

1152
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,200
want it

1153
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,640
and at that point uh you panic so

1154
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,240
don't you know the way to get around

1155
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,839
that is to really look through your log

1156
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,680
data have a review process so maybe you

1157
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,079
can catch that before

1158
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,359
before it becomes an incident

1159
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,000
so uh kind of at the end of my deck here

1160
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,680
to summarize though

1161
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
the third party problem is is a clear

1162
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,800
and present danger

1163
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
uh it's becoming bigger and bigger as we

1164
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
have more folks on our networks than

1165
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,560
in our systems who aren't employees and

1166
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,800
you know uh there's a lot of challenges

1167
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,320
to it there are ways to

1168
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,240
deal with these challenges and at the

1169
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,880
bottom line is really third party access

1170
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,040
shouldn't be treated as regular internal

1171
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,119
employee access you have to treat them

1172
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,880
differently and have different controls

1173
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,839
so there's my information uh if if you

1174
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,040
want to email me

1175
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
any questions later or get a hold of me

1176
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:29,839
