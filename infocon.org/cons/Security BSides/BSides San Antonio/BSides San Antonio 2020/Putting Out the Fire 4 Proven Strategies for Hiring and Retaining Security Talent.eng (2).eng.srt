1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,080
thank you very much

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,040
glad to be here

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,360
all right so as an industry we have a

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,559
layer eight problem

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,799
right and it's our own fault we say that

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,079
there's a talent shortage

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,439
and that we need good people but once we

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,240
get them we have a tendency to burn them

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,960
out

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
leaving a trail of dissatisfied and

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,279
unhappy workers behind us

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,519
so this talk will cover some key

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,880
strategies to help

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,320
change that and i want to kind of caveat

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
it to say that

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
we've had some excellent talks here

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,879
today about careers changing careers

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,000
finding careers and there's more to come

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,719
on that subject this is not going to

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,480
answer all the questions and this is not

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,200
about

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
job hunting right the primary focus here

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,160
is people who are in a position to make

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,719
changes

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
and a lot of times that's management but

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
a lot of times it's also

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,680
those of us working in the trenches if

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,080
we have an opportunity to

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,560
influence those who can actually make

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,760
things change

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,320
then we need to work on that we need to

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,640
try to take advantage of that

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,920
and this is really kind of the the big

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
thing here that i want to see

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,758
us as an industry make some changes

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
a little bit about me um besides what

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
was in the intro there

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,960
like i said i spent several years doing

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,079
digital forensics

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,200
and incident response consulting i moved

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
from there into corporate

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
in financial services and i ran our

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,439
security operations team for several

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,479
years

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,320
and i've been with red canary on the

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
detection engineering team now

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,880
for a bit over four years and i lead our

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,360
search

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,560
training program

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
as i said for years infosec as an

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
industry has been complaining about

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,719
talent shortages and retention

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
challenges but from what i've seen

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,600
for the most part we just keep doing the

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,719
same thing

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,318
over and over again and at the same time

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,720
we hope for different results and so

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
we'll talk about that a bit as it helps

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
frame up the conversation

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
i'll share some of my experience

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,760
uh starting a new job and

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
also um as it as it helps show why we

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
need that change right from a personal

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,920
experience standpoint

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
and then we'll go through some of the

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
things that we've done at

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,080
red canary to be the

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
change that we want to see

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,760
and to wrap up with some thoughts on the

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,518
future where do we go from here

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,920
all right so if we have a people problem

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,720
and as with most issues it's complicated

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
this is not a simple thing there's not a

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
straightforward answer

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
but it is a layer eight issue now most

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
of the time

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,640
in infosec or in any kind of technology

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
field when you hear layer 8

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
it's because somebody did something

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,239
wrong

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,640
but this is really more about the

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
overarching issue

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
and while there is a certain amount of

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
responsibility for the individual

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,239
this isn't so much about that aspect

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,959
i'm here to talk about some things from

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,280
the

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,000
business perspective and what can be

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,080
done from that side

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
to help retain good people

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
and we hear a lot about having a

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,239
shortage of qualified people in infosec

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,239
and we talk about the need to hire

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,959
newcomers with little experience

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,080
but then we complain because the

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
newcomers don't know what's expected of

97
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,280
them

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,599
and the people with experience think

99
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,480
that they know what's expected of them

100
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,519
but a lot of times they really don't and

101
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,640
so then we wonder

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,439
why neither category stays at a job for

103
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,400
more than six months to a year

104
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,040
right six months to a year that's not

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
longevity

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
so presuming that we're hiring people

107
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,879
that we think

108
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,600
are capable of doing a good job and we

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,320
want them to stay around for many years

110
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,360
what do we do to change the status quo

111
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,040
a little bit of a side here emphasizing

112
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
the aspect of what it means to be

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
capable to do the job especially when

114
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
we're talking about newcomers that have

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
a lack of experience

116
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
being capable doesn't mean that someone

117
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,160
needs to know

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,800
everything or be able to do everything

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,560
for that job

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
rather it means that they have the

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,320
capacity to learn

122
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,120
what's required for that job can they

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,800
think through a problem

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
can they apply logic and real world

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,360
experience to propose solutions to

126
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,479
problems

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,360
do they understand how theory can be

128
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,639
applied to

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,600
reality these are valuable traits in

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,479
employees

131
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,360
and when we find them we need to

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,639
cultivate them

133
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,919
and help them flourish this is really

134
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,280
important

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
a lot of times we we look for people

136
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,280
that

137
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,400
have everything that we need

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,120
for the specific position but that may

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
not

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
that's in some ways that's like the

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,720
golden unicorn right it may not exist

142
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
so we need to develop those traits in

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,199
people who are capable

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,479
even if they're not immediately ready to

145
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,359
do that job

146
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,919
and as an industry i think that we're

147
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,160
getting a lot better at seeking out new

148
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
talent

149
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
trying to create opportunities and ways

150
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,319
to engage with college graduates

151
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
transitioning veterans and people doing

152
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,199
complete career changes

153
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
there's been some talks already here at

154
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,560
b-sides on those topics

155
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
we're trying to bring in new blood and

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,840
that's a good thing

157
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,919
we're also trying to provide homes for

158
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
displaced old-timers

159
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
which is also a good thing

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,280
but when we bring people on

161
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
we need to make sure that they are

162
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
properly prepared

163
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,919
for the job at hand and then we need to

164
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,240
keep them around

165
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
and this is where training comes in

166
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,479
so we talk a lot and we hear a lot about

167
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
looking for candidates who can

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,680
hit the ground running because it costs

169
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,720
too much and it takes too much time to

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
get people up to speed

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
to do the job and so the average

172
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,639
number that gets tossed around is that

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,360
it takes roughly one year for a business

174
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,840
to start to recoup the initial cost of

175
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,039
hiring someone

176
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,720
between you know job search or candidate

177
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,440
searches

178
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
to try to find people all the costs

179
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
going into screening

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,479
as well as onboarding and then paying

181
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,160
out for that first year it takes a lot

182
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,680
of time and money

183
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,240
and so as a business it's all about that

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,639
return on investment right it's all

185
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,880
about how we're spending money

186
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,800
especially for infosec because it's a

187
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
cost center

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
right so we try to shortcut the process

189
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160
to make it more profitable sooner

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,639
how do we do that by throwing people

191
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,960
into the fire

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,319
but there they get burned out and they

193
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:48,960
leave

194
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,319
after six months to a year

195
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,520
so if it takes a year to get started to

196
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
recoup that initial cost

197
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
and they're leaving after six months or

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
a year

199
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,879
you can do the math pretty easily it's a

200
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
failing cycle

201
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,440
but what if instead what if we change

202
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
that cycle

203
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,400
what if we made that initial investment

204
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,960
and we took some time to properly train

205
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,759
them to do

206
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,039
the job we're investing in somebody

207
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,080
already

208
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,919
we think that they're capable of doing

209
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,000
the job we think that they'll

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,319
be a good person and we want to keep

211
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,360
them around as an

212
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
employee why don't we better prepare

213
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
them for that

214
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,599
if they're better prepared to do the

215
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,080
work they better understand the

216
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
expectations

217
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,080
then they're already off to a better

218
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
start than the majority of new hires in

219
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,519
our industry

220
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,519
and that's making a difference right

221
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
there

222
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,640
now every industry every business

223
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,160
every job needs structure

224
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,800
people need structure it helps us to

225
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,399
function

226
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,839
but within an infosec there are a lot of

227
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,519
silos a lot of tears

228
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,920
a lot of you can't do that approaches

229
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
i work in what most people would call a

230
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
sock and while socks

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
aren't the sole owners of such things

232
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
they are certainly well known for it

233
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,480
just like knocks help desks infosec in

234
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,040
general

235
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,480
i.t in general the newcomers that we're

236
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,959
trying

237
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,080
so hard to bring in

238
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,800
who have very little experience aren't

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,680
allowed to do

240
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,720
anything but triage

241
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,000
and then escalate to somebody else to do

242
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,680
the next step

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,519
it's inefficient it's unfulfilling

244
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
and it doesn't allow room to grow

245
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
so as soon as they get to a point where

246
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
they know something

247
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
or they even think that they know

248
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,080
something

249
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,560
they leave because they're already fed

250
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
up with the status quo

251
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,279
they're fed up with not being able to do

252
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,600
interesting things they're fed up with

253
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
being stuck in a corner

254
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,720
and so those that do stick around and do

255
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
their job well

256
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,519
are forced into management in order to

257
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,079
advance

258
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
to receive pay increases to get more

259
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,839
responsibility

260
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,920
and that's whether or not they want to

261
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,720
go into management

262
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,279
for the majority of technical people

263
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,519
moving into management is not

264
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,760
a good move we have to have a way to

265
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,640
avoid all that

266
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
now i'm a firm believer in the value of

267
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
stories as

268
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,760
a way to help humans relate to one

269
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
another

270
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,800
and so i'll use my own experience as an

271
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
example

272
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
and while this is from when i started

273
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,160
with red canary

274
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,839
it's not too different from other

275
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,440
experiences that i've had

276
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
and i expect that it will be very

277
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,399
familiar to many of you

278
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,720
so i started with ray canary in early

279
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,200
2016

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,279
and at the time there were a total of 10

281
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,040
people working there

282
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,519
i was the fourth hire for the analysis

283
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,399
team

284
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
all of whom worked remote

285
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,600
and starting off followed the basic

286
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,640
outline here

287
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,000
as with so many jobs the primary

288
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,959
difference

289
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,079
was that our ceo tasked me with taking

290
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,800
notes on how i thought things went

291
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,120
since i was very much an outsider at

292
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,640
that point

293
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
leadership recognized the potential for

294
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,200
problems for issues

295
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,399
and realized that the people who were

296
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,320
there wouldn't necessarily be able to

297
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,440
see them

298
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,399
and they were looking actively for ways

299
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,279
to identify

300
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
and fix those things to improve them and

301
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,279
make everything better for everybody

302
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,040
that worked there

303
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,440
and we're based in denver so starting

304
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,839
off i flew to denver and i spent roughly

305
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,560
four days

306
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,000
on site realistically it was

307
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,360
three days ish i mean three days is kind

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,639
of stretching

309
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
stretching it a bit uh but three days of

310
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,360
training with the lead analyst

311
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,839
who is now the vp of our cert who lives

312
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,839
in the area

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,800
then i headed back home to work remotely

314
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,440
on my own

315
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,000
i'm a good analyst i've got a strong

316
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
background

317
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,040
and it's a job that just fits me

318
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,760
right it's like doing forensic work in

319
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,360
incident response work

320
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,120
was made for me or i was made for it

321
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
i'm really good at what i do

322
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,760
but that was really a challenge

323
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
and it had part of it was it had been

324
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,839
almost a year since the

325
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,880
last analyst had been hired and so many

326
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,800
changes had occurred in that time

327
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,920
things that everyone else just knew

328
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,839
but it was way too much to absorb

329
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,040
without a formal program of any sort

330
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,079
and obviously working remotely is

331
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,120
different than being

332
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,560
in an office but realistically the

333
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
experience wasn't all that different

334
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
right there was a minimal amount of

335
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320
informal training

336
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,240
followed by the expectation that you

337
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
could do the work accordingly and

338
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,600
appropriately

339
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
and that's just not necessarily

340
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,480
realistic

341
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,600
fortunately everyone was open to change

342
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
like i said they recognized the

343
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,639
potential for problems they

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,600
recognized the need to do things

345
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,199
differently

346
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,480
i had taken a lot of notes and i was the

347
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,399
one who kept suggesting ways that i

348
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,399
thought would make things better

349
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,839
so of course i was handed the task

350
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
i guess you could say that i volunteered

351
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,920
at any rate this was the first place

352
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,880
that i'd been

353
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,959
where this kind of change was not just a

354
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,399
possibility

355
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,079
but it was encouraged so to everybody

356
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,000
listening today everybody here that's in

357
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,079
a leadership role

358
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,959
this is the place where you get to

359
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,279
facilitate change

360
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,399
listen to your people entertain what may

361
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,440
seem like crazy

362
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,480
ideas and encourage contributions that

363
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,760
wouldn't otherwise happen

364
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
and for those of you listening that are

365
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,760
not in leadership roles

366
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,839
this is your opportunity to influence

367
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,000
that

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,639
talk to your managers talk to your

369
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,839
leaders

370
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
talk to your mentors encourage

371
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,959
change to occur right sometimes it's one

372
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,760
step at a time and it's a slow process

373
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,720
but it won't happen if we don't try all

374
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,120
of us

375
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,199
working together are what's going to

376
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,720
make it happen

377
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,839
not one person grumbling in a corner

378
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,240
if as an industry we keep doing things

379
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,959
the way that we've been doing them

380
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,760
we're not going to improve right that's

381
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,480
the whole

382
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,959
definition of insanity thing keep doing

383
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,760
the same thing

384
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,800
expecting different results so as a

385
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
company

386
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
we identified things that were important

387
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
to us

388
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
and we started figuring out ways to meet

389
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,480
those key objectives

390
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,839
now this may seem obvious

391
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,160
but what i've commonly observed is that

392
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
we tend to establish what we

393
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
think the outcome should be what the

394
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,360
outcome should

395
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,000
look like and then we work backward from

396
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,680
there

397
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,000
instead we went the opposite way we

398
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
defined an objective

399
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,279
not what it should look like

400
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,680
and then we figured out ways working

401
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,720
forward

402
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
to meet that objective

403
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,199
so challenge assumptions don't accept

404
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,040
status quo

405
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,480
figure out what your actual needs are

406
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,320
based on alignment to the business

407
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
because again

408
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,680
infosec is a cost center if you're not

409
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,160
aligning your output to the business

410
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
the business is not going to accept what

411
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
you're trying to do

412
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,519
once you've figured out your needs

413
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,360
you've figured out how you align to the

414
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,199
business in that regard

415
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,399
then you can come up with ways to meet

416
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,079
those needs and we focused on four areas

417
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,199
that were important

418
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
to us

419
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,680
and here's where we are now we're never

420
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,240
in an

421
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,680
end state right it's always just

422
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
current as we expect to keep growing

423
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,320
we expect to keep changing and we expect

424
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,880
to meet

425
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,639
new needs as they arrive after all

426
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,560
infosec's work is never done

427
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,959
and a big part of that is training so

428
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,959
we've built out a training program that

429
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,760
allows us to have a repeatable process

430
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,959
to help new analysts regardless of their

431
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,520
specific experience coming in

432
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,799
to be comfortable and competent doing

433
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,240
the core job

434
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,760
within a month that's followed by a

435
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
month of mentoring

436
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,520
so that they have a specific team member

437
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,240
to help ensure that they get acclimated

438
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,440
and connected none of what we do

439
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
is is the proverbial you know rocket

440
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,520
science

441
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
but it is highly technical and it

442
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
requires understanding of analysis

443
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,160
workflow and internal processes

444
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,880
even experienced practitioners need that

445
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,280
initial training

446
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
the ultimate goal of our initial

447
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
training program is to develop a new

448
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,320
analyst's

449
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
core competence in order to publish

450
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,799
timely and actionable threat detections

451
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,880
to our customers

452
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,799
that's the key thing that we're going

453
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,919
for and that's the

454
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,080
core job that they need to be able to do

455
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
and it's important that documentation

456
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
reflects what we do

457
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,120
how we do it and why

458
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,200
if it doesn't it's pretty much useless

459
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
so we've developed internal resources to

460
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
help answer questions

461
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,200
and to serve as a source of record for

462
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,039
how we do things

463
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,480
naturally those change over time

464
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,720
and if they or their contents are no

465
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,080
longer relevant

466
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,000
then they're changed or purged as needed

467
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,559
now this also isn't easy it's not

468
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,720
straightforward it requires diligence it

469
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,360
requires

470
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,440
work it requires effort and

471
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,400
documentation

472
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,080
is a challenge for any and every

473
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,000
organization that i've ever been

474
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,160
in but it's so important

475
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
if we don't have it written down then

476
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,200
everything is tribal knowledge

477
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
and if it's all tribal knowledge we

478
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,640
cannot

479
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,520
expect to get good outcomes from

480
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,840
bringing new people on

481
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,520
a lot of us industry-wide and

482
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,400
pretty much everybody on my team has

483
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
seen or experienced

484
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,840
pain from having a tiered structure

485
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,120
and this is a pet peeve for many of us

486
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,039
so we did away with it yes we have tears

487
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,880
with regards to pay grades

488
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,440
and higher level expectations but our

489
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,320
job descriptions are the same

490
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,039
and we're all responsible to do the same

491
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,520
core

492
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
job

493
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,720
outside that core job of pushing timely

494
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
and actionable threat detections to our

495
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,760
customers

496
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
everyone on the team has the freedom and

497
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,120
the responsibility

498
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
to be involved in other things that help

499
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,880
the cert

500
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,320
support and align with the business

501
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,640
we all get to contribute to things like

502
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,159
detector development

503
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,480
platform improvement operational

504
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,440
efficiencies

505
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,159
threat hunting and intelligence writing

506
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,200
blog posts and

507
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,720
and giving talks like this if our future

508
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,799
doesn't look bright

509
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,720
it's probably our own fault

510
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
in order to provide ways for our people

511
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,000
to develop and expand

512
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,720
skill sets and increase responsibilities

513
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,039
without moving into management

514
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,640
because remember i said for a lot of

515
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,200
technical people if not most

516
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,480
that's not a good move so we initially

517
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,200
stood up the concept of having different

518
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,320
practices within the cert these still

519
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,960
exist

520
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,919
to a lesser degree but in order to

521
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,559
better align to the business

522
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,960
we have defined a specific set of

523
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
objectives to focus on everybody on the

524
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
greater team

525
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
is part of one or more of those

526
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,360
objective

527
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,799
oriented teams and involved with helping

528
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,080
move our operations

529
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,159
forward specific to that objective

530
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,480
each of these teams owns or has

531
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,720
responsibility over certain aspects of

532
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,520
our work

533
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,480
to drive improvements these provide

534
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,039
opportunities to learn new soft skills

535
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,720
new technical skills and expand areas

536
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,360
of interest

537
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,520
and so here's where we go deeper into

538
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,159
that four week training of new hires

539
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,640
now some of you may have been a little

540
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
surprised to hear that we do four weeks

541
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,840
of training

542
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,679
after all that means that analysts are

543
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,919
going to be taken out of production

544
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,320
in order to train others that's

545
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,960
absolutely right

546
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
it's something that we expect it's

547
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
something that we accept

548
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,960
we're doing that upfront investment

549
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,320
into our people because we think

550
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,039
that it's going to help keep them around

551
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,320
longer

552
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,000
we don't want people leaving after six

553
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
months or a year

554
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,559
we want them to stay two three four or

555
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,200
more years

556
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,679
we also don't expect that our analysts

557
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,280
are spending a hundred percent of their

558
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,159
time

559
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,120
working on events or working on threats

560
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,280
anyway

561
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,799
right that's not a hundred percent of

562
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,720
their job that's the core job

563
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,600
but that's not a hundred percent of it

564
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,640
and training

565
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
again is something that's extremely

566
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,960
important to us

567
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,159
and since we all work remotely we now

568
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:46,880
train

569
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,720
the same way keeping the same workflow

570
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,799
there's no more going to denver for a

571
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,000
few days

572
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,679
we use video calls voice screen sharing

573
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
we use technology to help

574
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,320
make that happen which in the current

575
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,960
scenario was really beneficial for us

576
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,679
because

577
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,039
when everybody's trying to figure out

578
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
how to work from home because of covid

579
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
we were already ready for it it didn't

580
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,520
make a difference at least not to our

581
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
team

582
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,360
and thus as the company transitioned

583
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,200
over to doing that

584
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
we were able to help the rest of the

585
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,039
company

586
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,039
make adjustments share from our

587
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,240
experience

588
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,799
to help make that transition to working

589
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,520
remotely

590
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,400
go a lot more smoothly

591
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,919
so diving into the training

592
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,640
from day one to week four we have a

593
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
training matrix

594
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,440
and this matrix lists out topics that

595
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,640
tie in directly with our documentation

596
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,279
which directly relates to our work our

597
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,720
workflow

598
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
this helps us to be thorough and

599
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,360
consistent throughout the process

600
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,720
and everybody on the team has a hand in

601
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,320
training new analysts

602
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,480
across all shifts so we realize that

603
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,640
everybody learns and teaches differently

604
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,520
and having that variety helps on both

605
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,360
sides of that equation

606
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
so not only does the trainee have a

607
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,720
better chance of connecting and

608
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,799
engaging with the team at large

609
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,279
especially since we're remote

610
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,200
they also have more opportunities to

611
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,559
learn the way

612
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,080
that they learn and at the same time

613
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,640
our analysts learn more by teaching

614
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,919
others

615
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,840
this has led to a number of improvements

616
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,720
in different areas

617
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,679
now week one week one is handled by an

618
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,840
analyst that is a dedicated member of

619
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,240
the training practice

620
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,640
this helps establish a baseline and it

621
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
helps reduce the resource load on the

622
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
greater team

623
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
day one starts off with typical hr you

624
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,960
know onboarding stuff getting accounts

625
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
set up

626
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,840
then it switches over to training we

627
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
meet up

628
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
we review the matrix we set expectations

629
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,279
for the training process

630
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,520
and then we assign homework so we have a

631
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
technical video library

632
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,080
that covers a lot of the topics of the

633
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,480
analysis process our workflow things

634
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,400
that people will need to know

635
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,440
in their daily life of work

636
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,400
and so those are homework to go through

637
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,039
to help

638
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,760
kind of jump start the training process

639
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
get some of the language that we use the

640
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,120
phrases the terminology things like that

641
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,360
in front of them so as we get into the

642
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,720
process

643
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,400
things will make a little bit more sense

644
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,840
than if we just jump in raw

645
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
day two we start off with the

646
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,400
training analyst doing the driving right

647
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,080
they're sharing their screen

648
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,320
they show and explain the interface the

649
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,200
workflow

650
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
analysis process etc toward the end of

651
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,000
the week

652
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,240
the analyst the training analyst is

653
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,840
still driving

654
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,400
but the trainee is trying to apply what

655
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,320
they've learned so far

656
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
by telling the analyst where to go next

657
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,279
what to do next

658
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,520
the analysts can guide them through that

659
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,320
process

660
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,640
right if they're not sure asking leading

661
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,600
questions

662
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,640
okay what are we looking at here you

663
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:24,960
know

664
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,799
what's going on what is the detector

665
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,799
that raised up this activity

666
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,039
what does that mean in this context all

667
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,559
right where are we going to pivot from

668
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,279
here

669
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,520
that sort of thing it's not about

670
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,000
the new person needing to remember all

671
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,440
the things

672
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,919
but rather building on what they've

673
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,279
learned and retained

674
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,400
to that point and we want to keep

675
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,360
kind of stretching them out right going

676
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,720
from

677
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
the most comfortable area to a less

678
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,919
comfortable area

679
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,600
and a little bit further and a little

680
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,360
bit further

681
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,720
rather than just great here's how we

682
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,200
work

683
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,520
here's what we do here's the workflow

684
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
you're smart

685
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,440
you've done this kind of stuff before

686
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
you're on your own get going ask

687
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
questions

688
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,159
they don't even know the questions to

689
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,279
ask at that point

690
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,880
and so we find typically the second week

691
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,520
that

692
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,080
trainees are generally ready to start

693
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,520
driving on their own

694
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,440
even if they're not super comfortable

695
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
doing that at first

696
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,840
with monitoring right we don't just put

697
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,640
them out into the wild what we typically

698
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,159
do is we have

699
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,640
open call with screen sharing the

700
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,520
trainee

701
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,039
is sharing their screen and the trainer

702
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,520
is

703
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,679
you know virtually watching over their

704
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,720
shoulder very closely

705
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,600
but they're not telling them what to do

706
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,720
next

707
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
but it's not okay go here click there

708
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,039
okay move aside let me get the mouse let

709
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,159
me just show you

710
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,159
right that's typically what happens in

711
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,080
an office we can't do that remotely

712
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,600
so it gives the trainee the freedom to

713
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
fumble around

714
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,559
and find it to try to remember

715
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,399
to ask questions and if if they're

716
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,679
really stuck

717
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,399
the trainer can say you know okay what

718
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,279
do you think

719
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,360
kind of guide them through that process

720
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,760
help them to the next step

721
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,480
again instead of just being on their own

722
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,440
and as it progresses through the week

723
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,520
this becomes less and less of an active

724
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,960
screen sharing session

725
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,000
they're probably going to keep the

726
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,039
screen up the entire week

727
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,960
but the trainer is spending less and

728
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
less time looking at what the trainee is

729
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,320
doing

730
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,279
so part of this is the trainer is

731
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,200
starting to reclaim some of their own

732
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,559
time

733
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,840
to do their core job

734
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,919
and then by week three there's usually

735
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,120
um an open call

736
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,399
but probably not screen sharing maybe at

737
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,240
first

738
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,480
but we want to drop off of that pretty

739
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,600
quickly

740
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,679
and drop off a call entirely if that's

741
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,520
possible

742
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,559
either of those can be engaged as needed

743
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,559
but again we want to keep stretching

744
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,080
that new hire out

745
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,919
getting them outside of their comfort

746
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,159
zone moving to the next step

747
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,760
kind of gaining more and more

748
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,159
independence taking the training wheels

749
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,960
off if you will

750
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
the trainee can also reach out to

751
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,080
anybody on the team

752
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,559
not just their assigned trainer for that

753
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,080
day

754
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,039
right obviously the trainer is there but

755
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,799
if they worked with somebody the day

756
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,840
before

757
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,399
that they really had an understanding

758
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,840
they really clicked

759
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,320
and the way that the person explained

760
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,919
things made sense

761
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,520
and they want to reach out to them

762
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,200
that's fine there's no

763
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
like stigma on that we try to leverage

764
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
this third week

765
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,840
as a good part of their chance to fly

766
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,080
solo as much as possible

767
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,520
and if things are going really well um

768
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,360
you know we've we've had sometimes with

769
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
people that do have a little bit more

770
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
experience as they come on

771
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,080
everything starts clicking quickly the

772
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
trainer may take time to help them get

773
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,200
set up with

774
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,240
other aspects of what we do so building

775
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,679
out their detector development

776
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,640
environments

777
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,120
uh showing them how we gain stats from

778
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,640
the work that we do

779
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,679
so that we can improve our process tune

780
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,559
detectors

781
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,678
things of this nature

782
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,600
and then we go into week four

783
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,880
this is a week to really truly fly

784
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,080
solo the trainee works core business

785
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,520
hours not on a shift

786
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,120
anymore and they do not have an assigned

787
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,039
trainer

788
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,600
if they run into issues there to do what

789
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
everybody else does

790
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,799
ask for help given that all of our

791
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,440
training

792
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,519
is based on a business week monday

793
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,799
through friday

794
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,840
but our analysts work four 10-hour

795
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,120
shifts

796
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
we make sure that the new person gets a

797
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,039
chance to have a weekend

798
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,760
before starting their regular shift

799
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,559
alright so

800
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,240
we don't just go right up to the end and

801
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,000
then kick them over

802
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,360
with no time off this week

803
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,679
also gives the opportunity to schedule

804
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,640
time with

805
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,919
other teams within the cert you know

806
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,279
intel threat research

807
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,720
you know incident handlers things of

808
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,960
this nature

809
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,120
time with our different objectives team

810
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,320
leads

811
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,720
or going back to setting up you know

812
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
development or testing environments

813
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,159
things of that nature

814
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,840
and i want to note we don't expect

815
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,640
new analysts to be contributing to any

816
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,279
of these

817
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,559
extra areas right from the start

818
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,159
right do the core job get familiar get

819
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:06,880
comfortable

820
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,919
with that core job that's the most

821
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,799
important thing

822
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,559
we can branch out from there but we do

823
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,960
want to have them exposed to those

824
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,760
concepts

825
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,039
we do want to have them with the

826
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,559
expectation that they are

827
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,600
going to be contributing in ways

828
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,799
beyond just that core job

829
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,799
getting more involved and expanding

830
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,159
those contributions

831
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,000
is handled more directly by their

832
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,440
manager as they progress

833
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,080
so overall we want our analysts to have

834
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,720
exposure to everybody on the team

835
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,399
to have the greatest potential for

836
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,559
connecting for building relationships

837
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,640
for understanding how we work

838
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,799
not just within the cert but as the

839
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,799
entire company

840
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,880
and so by pairing them up with the rest

841
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
of the team

842
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,480
during their training working on all

843
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,919
shifts

844
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,880
they not only get greater exposure to

845
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,240
everybody on the team

846
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,440
the different training styles etc but

847
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,679
also better familiarity with the types

848
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,039
of events that are seen

849
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,600
on different shifts the stuff that

850
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,679
occurs at 2 pm

851
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,159
is not the same thing as what occurs at

852
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,159
2 am

853
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,919
and if you've got customers around the

854
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,919
globe or in different time zones

855
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,240
there's a lot of variation going on and

856
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,720
so having exposure to those again

857
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,320
helps create a more uh well-rounded

858
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,320
a more capable person working

859
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,159
that core job and during that process

860
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,720
our trainers aren't locked into you

861
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,519
teach this

862
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,240
you teach this they have the freedom to

863
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,960
focus on

864
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,440
areas that seem most relevant at that

865
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,640
time

866
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,480
if you get a little rabbit trail going

867
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,360
off the side

868
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,279
about a particular thing that you're

869
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,880
working on at that time

870
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,399
and that you know you kind of loop

871
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,559
through some different aspects of what

872
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,360
we do

873
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,560
that's great all this is going to pull

874
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,800
from the training matrix that we have

875
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,639
that you know we make sure that we're

876
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,280
covering all the topics that we need to

877
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,800
they don't have to be in a specific

878
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,480
order necessarily

879
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,159
right there are some some things that we

880
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,918
need to kind of front load

881
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,399
but a large bit of it it doesn't matter

882
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,599
if you do it now or

883
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,800
tomorrow or you know three days from now

884
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,239
so you've got the the freedom

885
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,280
to do what is right in the moment

886
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
and this also helps trainees to learn

887
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,639
more effectively and more efficiently

888
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,359
and again just re-emphasizing

889
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,320
reiterating

890
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,480
we don't expect our new people to come

891
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,679
out of training knowing

892
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,800
everything but we expect them to be able

893
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,560
to do that core job

894
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,719
with confidence and independence

895
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,560
and so following our initial four-week

896
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,520
program

897
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,760
new analysts are paired up with someone

898
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,839
who works on the same shift

899
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,320
to serve as a sort of mentor or guide

900
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,040
now

901
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,200
this isn't the kind of the typical

902
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,880
mentor program that i've seen

903
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,040
where it's really all about teaching or

904
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,720
training someone

905
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,040
this is more focused on helping them get

906
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,079
plugged in

907
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,320
helping them get connected answering

908
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,280
questions

909
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,680
gaining familiarity with all the other

910
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,000
aspects of the job that we do

911
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,839
and if they haven't gotten set up on

912
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,839
things like detector development

913
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,359
this is when that happens we still

914
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,359
typically find that new people

915
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,079
take upwards of six months to really

916
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,240
start getting in the groove

917
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,200
so we don't have specific goals or

918
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,839
markers set of you must be doing x

919
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,839
by date y managers work directly with

920
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,240
them

921
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,880
in one-on-one settings to help expand

922
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,320
their contributions to the team again

923
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,440
the main thing is

924
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,000
we want that core job done and even with

925
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,960
the

926
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,520
um you know the extended training that

927
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,079
we do

928
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,560
and the the you know the careful

929
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,000
structure that we have with

930
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,040
it we still see that it takes upwards of

931
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,200
six months

932
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,880
right so if you think about that

933
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,280
and when i started and shortly

934
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,560
thereafter for the people that we

935
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,720
brought on it was closer to a year

936
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,040
so realistically we've cut that time in

937
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,400
half

938
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,359
but it's still six months so if you have

939
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,359
people leaving after six months or year

940
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,800
they don't even know how to do their job

941
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,040
yet

942
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,560
and then you have to start all over not

943
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,000
only is that bad from a business

944
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,359
perspective but it's bad from the

945
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,240
employee perspective

946
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,920
if if they didn't even learn what to do

947
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,599
at the last job and now they're moving

948
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,040
on to the next job

949
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,640
and the next job is really the same as

950
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,079
the last job

951
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,000
but with a different process different

952
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,119
interface

953
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,800
they're gonna be starting all over it's

954
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,680
just a recipe for frustration

955
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,720
anyway this is

956
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
this is where i think it starts to get

957
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,640
really cool

958
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,400
everyone across all teams in the cert

959
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,000
so intel incident handlers

960
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,280
even technical support people that

961
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
aren't directly responsible for creating

962
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,880
threat detections

963
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,920
they still go through an element

964
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,640
of this same training right it's

965
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,680
tailored

966
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,720
according to what their needs are going

967
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,200
to be

968
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,640
to understand that process of how the

969
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,520
soup is made

970
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,440
if you will because that's that

971
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,680
core work product right our threat

972
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,359
detections as a business

973
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,640
is our core work product so we want

974
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,079
everybody in the cert to understand

975
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,960
how that happens they may not be doing

976
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,200
it directly

977
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,760
but they're tied in with it and so they

978
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,119
need to know

979
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,960
so they may go through two weeks or one

980
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,040
week of training on it

981
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,079
and since we have a formal structured

982
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,680
program

983
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,160
we've also been able to build out and

984
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,720
offer

985
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,440
appropriate training to everybody else

986
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,720
in the company

987
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,880
whether they're in technical like on our

988
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,440
our engineering and development side

989
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,480
if they're in business side marketing

990
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,839
sales and we've had nothing but positive

991
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,079
feedback

992
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,800
from that and doing so has helped break

993
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,119
down

994
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,160
walls barriers and build relationships

995
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
across the business

996
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,720
so you think about that typically

997
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,920
it's us versus them right especially

998
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,599
when it comes to people on the sales

999
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,280
side

1000
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,800
we don't talk the same language

1001
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,640
but because of the way that we've built

1002
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,160
out this training program

1003
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,320
and the success that we've had within

1004
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,440
the cert

1005
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,920
the rest of the company is willing to go

1006
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,800
through some of that same training

1007
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,160
and they benefit from it

1008
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,240
i want to stress that these are things

1009
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,119
that have worked for

1010
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,680
us right they've worked for our company

1011
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,160
i firmly believe that they will work for

1012
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,680
other companies

1013
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
but each organization has to determine

1014
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,839
their own needs

1015
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,000
and drive changes that are going to help

1016
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,880
meet those

1017
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,200
needs i'll just try and do what we did

1018
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,200
if it helps if it works if it fits great

1019
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,440
but look at what you need in your

1020
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,960
organization

1021
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
how that aligns with the business and

1022
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,000
how you can help improve

1023
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,040
the future so we started out a long way

1024
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,880
from where we are now

1025
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,520
and even after we began down this path

1026
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,359
we continue to make changes

1027
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,000
we're making changes to this very day

1028
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,079
and there's a good chance that by next

1029
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,760
week

1030
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,000
i'll have to update this presentation in

1031
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,160
some way to keep it relevant

1032
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
right to keep it current with what we're

1033
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,399
doing

1034
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,240
the threat landscape is constantly

1035
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,680
changing

1036
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,160
businesses are constantly changing and

1037
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,440
the way that we approach

1038
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,240
training and retaining our employees

1039
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,480
needs to change from status quo

1040
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,960
as well

1041
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,000
now from what i've observed directly and

1042
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,920
indirectly

1043
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,400
throwing people into the fire as seems

1044
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,960
to be

1045
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,839
most common isn't really working

1046
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,880
it leads to problems of skill gaps job

1047
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,839
satisfaction career progression

1048
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,880
retention

1049
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,319
and talent shortages there's no doubt

1050
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,560
that we're facing significant challenges

1051
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,000
ahead

1052
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,160
but i'm confident that if we approach

1053
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,920
this conscientiously

1054
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
and start being deliberate in the way

1055
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,480
that we deal with our people problem

1056
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,640
that we can make a positive difference

1057
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,960
and that's it for my presentation um if

1058
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,160
there are any questions

1059
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,560
i'm happy to answer and i'll also be

1060
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,440
over in the

1061
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,640
track three breakout um if anybody wants

1062
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:14,960
to

1063
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,839
to go back and forth on stuff there

1064
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,119
