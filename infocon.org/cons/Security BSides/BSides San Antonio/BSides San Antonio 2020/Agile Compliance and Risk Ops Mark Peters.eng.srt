1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,839
good morning i'm dr mark peters from

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,280
tech incorporation i'm here with agile

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
compliance and risk operations

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,080
uh talking about some of the things

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,600
we've done to implement devops some

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,080
government contractor spaces in the past

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,840
uh year that i've been employed in those

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,280
areas

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,639
i have to remind everybody as i talk

10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,759
about government stuff that i don't

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,279
actually speak for the government uh

12
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,560
program for which i'm employed i'm

13
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,320
speaking for myself and my company

14
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,160
uh these are my personal views don't

15
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,519
necessarily represent any of those other

16
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,880
books along the way

17
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,640
i also mentioned that i do tend to talk

18
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
really fast and i'm going to try to slow

19
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,439
myself down to make the time moments

20
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,480
appropriately

21
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,760
but we'll see how it goes along the way

22
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,640
so as all the talks start first we have

23
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,280
to move and

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,160
i think i've lost my webcam there we go

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,840
and there we go so who am i a quick

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,879
introduction

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,239
i used to work in air force intelligence

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,840
i spent about 22 years working for the

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,360
u.s air force i went all over the world

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,120
and all kinds of different things

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
for different people telling them things

32
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,160
they didn't want to know what the

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
secrets were and finding out the secrets

34
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,119
from the opposite side

35
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,799
of our cyber security working on those

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,640
opposite perspectives to get things

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,200
through

38
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,240
needless to say working with the

39
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,080
government organization for that long i

40
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,920
got oodles of experience with compliance

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
practices making sure that the security

42
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,880
was in the right place

43
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,400
that the tools were in the right place

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,240
that things were moving from one side to

45
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,799
the other

46
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,159
and that all the information got to the

47
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
people they needed to do

48
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,840
so after enforcing those compliance

49
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,360
practices for years and years and being

50
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,720
on the other side of it

51
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
i got into cyber security uh and i got

52
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
into that practice because i spent some

53
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
time at the nsa and worked with some of

54
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,880
their functions i'd work with some of

55
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,320
the other cyber functions and i run a

56
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
couple different units doing cyber

57
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,560
things

58
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
back and forth along the way at those

59
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,079
times i got to implement those tools at

60
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,600
multiple levels to see how they worked

61
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,560
all the way from

62
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
building your own sets and having them

63
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,759
there and

64
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,040
trying to figure out how the computers

65
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
work to getting those results out to the

66
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,240
ops guys so that they could use it

67
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
effectively do what they wanted to do

68
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,079
in the past year that means what i've

69
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,280
done is i've worked with two different

70
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,479
agile

71
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,920
programs your government programs that

72
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,320
are enforcing cyber weapon systems for

73
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,040
the government

74
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
and they're trying to build an agile

75
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
transition their programs

76
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,560
for one i worked as the product owner

77
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
trying to make their pipelines and their

78
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
platforms work better

79
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,560
and for the other i've been the lead

80
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
security engineer so implementing

81
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
security all across the way

82
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,280
and trying to make those pieces all fit

83
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
together in a manner that everybody can

84
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
use most effectively

85
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
i'm also a devops institute ambassador

86
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
if you're curious about devops the

87
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,040
devops institute is out there and they

88
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
talk about the three ways all the time

89
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
when we talk about flow feedback in

90
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,599
continuous learning so i'll mention

91
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,519
those later in the talk as we go through

92
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
uh instant some of my other background

93
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
just real quick i'm an avid reader i

94
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,920
read a little bit of everything i read

95
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
history i read about devops i read about

96
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
business i read about sci-fi and fantasy

97
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,280
so if you've got any good books feel

98
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,599
free to lean out and recommend them

99
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,959
i've also done a lot of writing along

100
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
the way i actually published a book

101
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
about a year and a half ago called

102
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
cashing in on cyberpower where i looked

103
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
at 10 years of economic attacks for 10

104
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,200
years of cyber attacks

105
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
and how they developed economic

106
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
influences all across the world i do

107
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,000
have a doctorate in strategic security

108
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,519
not in arithmetic but in those reading

109
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,959
and writing functions

110
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
as we move forward so leaping into

111
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,480
the talk uh the problem was

112
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
as we came across as we moved into this

113
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
new role here as a lead security

114
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,640
engineer

115
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
is how does my security team ensure

116
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
compliance enforce the standards

117
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,800
and still remain agile now this remains

118
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,159
a problem for a lot because security is

119
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,040
seen as

120
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,080
non-flexible as we talked about they

121
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,519
look at their own things they don't

122
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
expand and they don't make this merge

123
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,200
but we want to be committed to the team

124
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
vision and the team organization

125
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,799
in order to do that we have to be agile

126
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,640
across the process and that starts with

127
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,000
looking at ourselves it doesn't start

128
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,120
with pointing the finger at the other

129
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
side of the fence

130
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,599
and looking at someone over there and

131
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,959
saying you know what you guys are doing

132
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,840
it wrong

133
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,120
and you need to fix it to do it the way

134
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,879
we do what we want to do is we wanted to

135
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,400
fix ourselves

136
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,840
so that we could be an example so that

137
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,200
we could lean into those things and

138
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
provide help to those other

139
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,760
organizations

140
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,680
as the cyber lead as a cyber security

141
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,439
lead in the security team we face this

142
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
problem daily we go out to everybody we

143
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,959
talk to everyone we say

144
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,200
you know what can we do how can we help

145
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
but we weren't getting there because we

146
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,599
were making the transition with the

147
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,120
government program for what used to be a

148
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,319
waterfall program

149
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,080
what is now said they're going to be an

150
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,519
agile program

151
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
and in that you still have a lot of the

152
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,280
old practices and you have the old ideas

153
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,799
and you have the old culture

154
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,399
and you need to move that forward and

155
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,918
one of those biggest challenges is we're

156
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,040
looking at the cyber team

157
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,440
is the government that dod that u.s air

158
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,400
force sector

159
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
uses the national institute of standards

160
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,479
and technology and use something called

161
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:26,960
853

162
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,240
which i'm sure a lot of you are familiar

163
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,040
with at 853 plus categories and controls

164
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
and indicators for doing a risk

165
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
management framework or they call it a

166
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,759
risk management framework

167
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,040
because it's supposed to guide you in

168
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,880
doing your cyber security but what

169
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,240
actually happens is you get

170
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,479
19 different families of controls with

171
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,000
over a thousand different controls and

172
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
indicators

173
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,160
and the government comes back and says

174
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,919
hey guess what we've got a thousand

175
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,120
different indicators we'd like you to

176
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,840
respond to

177
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,479
every indicator with artifacts and

178
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,840
examples of what you're doing and how

179
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,120
you're doing it

180
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
and how we move that forward but we

181
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,639
didn't want to go there we didn't want

182
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,199
to be

183
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,800
that tightly tied we didn't want to be

184
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
that tightly tied when we sat down with

185
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,199
the dev and said hey

186
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,800
you know what i need you to answer uh

187
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,160
about a thousand questions on how your

188
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
program is going what you're going to do

189
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,080
next

190
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
we wanted to be in an agile process

191
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
where we're talking about those four

192
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,479
basic principles those four guides to

193
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,280
agile

194
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
where we're talking about people over

195
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
processes we're talking about working

196
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,520
software

197
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,120
over uh comprehensive documentation

198
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
we're talking about moving forward the

199
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,080
whole scope of the things and we're

200
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,360
talking about using scrum and getting

201
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
that daily feedback into

202
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,320
something that's a uh a very standard

203
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,880
process

204
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,240
so as we're looking at the problem about

205
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
ensuring those compliance and forcing

206
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,039
standards remaining agile

207
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,240
we start looking at the parameters

208
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,919
because the parameters for us are the

209
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,039
things we have to consider

210
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,479
we have to do because we're working in

211
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,000
that government bureaucratic framework

212
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,120
and we've got to make sure that we can

213
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
move ahead

214
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
we've got to make sure that we can move

215
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,720
to the right places to actually

216
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,440
accomplish this

217
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,800
so we have to meet the standards that

218
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,320
they're laying out for us and as a

219
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,840
contractor we have to meet the standards

220
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,280
that are in our contract

221
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,199
as we move forward we have to be able to

222
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,560
manage risk and we have to be able to

223
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,919
manage risk effectively

224
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,440
because in the end that's what security

225
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
is about it's about tying risk down to

226
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,479
the factor

227
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,759
where you can get into the risk and you

228
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,600
can find things and then we had to look

229
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
as always at the third option of where

230
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
we could buy a solution who could we buy

231
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,440
a solution from

232
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,960
we just hire somebody else to come and

233
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
replace us and do the job for us at a

234
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,919
lower cost

235
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,280
i like the tom sawyer thing where you

236
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,639
pay everybody to paint your fence for

237
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,759
you

238
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,120
and then you just sit back and collect

239
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,759
at the end so

240
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,759
and looking at our parameters the first

241
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,120
as always like we said is to be

242
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,319
compliant or agile

243
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,919
now what we see is we see compliance or

244
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,840
agile is the opposite sides

245
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
of the room there's no compromise

246
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
between being compliant or being agile

247
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
and that the places that are inflexible

248
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,440
in their compliance

249
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,039
don't see it any different because we

250
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,720
see all kinds of compliance

251
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,479
we see the legally prescribed compliance

252
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,080
we see the organizationally prescribed

253
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
components

254
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,199
and we see sometimes even internally

255
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,400
prescribed deployments what do we have

256
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
to be compliant with the standard for

257
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,280
our organization

258
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
as we move forward into that setup now

259
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,199
this includes something like fits for

260
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,639
the cryptographic standards the nist

261
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
that i already talked about

262
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
fisma socks for the stocks and the

263
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,000
credit exchanges

264
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,479
the pci disks for your credit cards uh

265
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,039
the gdpr for

266
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,360
europe the ccpa that they've implemented

267
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
in california they're all different

268
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,599
standards

269
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,360
many times a lot of them apply many

270
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039
times only some of them apply

271
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,080
and many times they're good ideas but

272
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,440
they're not formal practices all these

273
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
compliance standards are usually very

274
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,639
administratively heavy there's a lot of

275
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,240
stuff that has to be done

276
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,919
and they're very difficult to implement

277
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
and that they're meant to be that way so

278
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,120
that you have experts that come in and

279
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,080
can enforce those

280
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
there's a lack of freedom and there's a

281
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,840
lot of blockers in those processes

282
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,759
but it's not true all the time sometimes

283
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,960
it just takes a different way of looking

284
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,520
at it

285
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
and i'd like to think that a lot of the

286
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,840
way of looking at that is in those agile

287
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,199
practices as we look at agile as we look

288
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:45,759
at the

289
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,520
lean scrum and those types of frameworks

290
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
that we can get to a devops mindset that

291
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
we need to a better way to interact

292
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
those things together

293
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,759
and make it more of a loose framework

294
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,000
that leads to our high level success in

295
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,039
getting the job done

296
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,639
but we've got to eliminate that that

297
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,479
whole that back and forth

298
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,400
on those processes so that we can get to

299
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
the right area

300
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
and we can get to the right place where

301
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
we're talking about the things that we

302
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,680
need to do

303
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,280
and we're talking in an effective manner

304
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,599
about those things we need to do

305
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
to move forward so we need to be

306
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,520
compliant and we need to be agile in

307
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,479
process

308
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
and being compliant being agile gets to

309
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,000
the same spot when you're talking about

310
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,800
security

311
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,919
and when you're talking about getting

312
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,680
security into the practices so that you

313
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,319
can deliver

314
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,680
effectively on the value for the

315
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,599
organization and that means you need to

316
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,400
talk about risk

317
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,399
you need to talk about risk management

318
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,679
and you need to be able to do the math

319
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,479
without numbers

320
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,640
and that's very contradictory statement

321
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,080
because there really is no math without

322
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,360
numbers but at the same time you're

323
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,039
talking about the various elements

324
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,440
of those processes you're talking about

325
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
the ability to

326
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
talk about those three elements or those

327
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,480
four elements that make up risk and when

328
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,760
you look at a risk equation or a

329
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,200
standard risk equation

330
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
you're talking about rat times

331
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
vulnerability time or risk equals threat

332
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,240
times vulnerability to exposure

333
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,240
and we want to lower all those elements

334
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,519
but in order to load those elements we

335
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,720
have to be able to talk about those

336
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,760
almost we have to be able to talk

337
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,120
effectively we have to know

338
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
what the threat is who's coming at us

339
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
where does it exist

340
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
and whether that threat is a foreign

341
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,839
malware source but that threat is just a

342
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,040
loss of business right

343
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
the threat to us may be that we can't

344
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,040
deliver unless we have that product out

345
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,920
there

346
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440
the vulnerabilities are those things

347
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,000
that exist in our system in our code

348
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,360
in our culture that may cause exceptions

349
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
may cause gaps in the future whether

350
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
it's a standard a

351
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,600
cve off the enterprise says hey we've

352
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
got a

353
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,120
a break in our program we've got a break

354
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,399
in our code and you know it's going to

355
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,360
be vulnerable and it's going to be a

356
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
critical failure unless we fix that

357
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,240
immediately

358
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,839
if we've got a break in our firewall if

359
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,000
we've got

360
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,360
all kinds of other vulnerabilities but

361
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
that also leads to exposure

362
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,399
and the reason i say it leads to is

363
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,160
exposure is managing risk exposure is

364
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
one of those key things especially in

365
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
working with government programs right

366
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
but you have to be able to talk about

367
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
effective exposure but

368
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,000
if you've only got a small area and that

369
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
small area is off-prem

370
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
and it's behind the number of firewalls

371
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,399
and it only reaches out through one way

372
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,920
and it only reaches through a vpn

373
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,959
that handling it handling a

374
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
exposure on that backend system may be

375
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
relatively minimal it may only cause you

376
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
relatively minimal risk

377
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,120
even if some other site like a cve or

378
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
miner says it's a critical failure

379
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
because it's so far behind that that

380
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
there's no exposure

381
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,079
to that system that you see so you have

382
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,519
to manage all those risks and you have

383
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,040
to compare between those risks

384
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,640
to be able to manage the structure in a

385
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,079
way that you can effectively present

386
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,120
those results

387
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
as you're sitting down and talking to

388
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,600
the devs and talking about your ability

389
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
to do your risk operations and your

390
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
azure compliance

391
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,160
and that's what we did we said we wanted

392
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
to be agilely compliant but we still

393
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
wanted to manage risk and we wanted to

394
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
manage risk for operations

395
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
and to us our agile compliance meant

396
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
that we needed to maintain

397
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,600
that compliance without sacrificing

398
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
flexibility i think earlier in one of

399
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,279
the presentations they talked about the

400
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,800
inflexible developers

401
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
well a lot of times security hits that

402
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
same in flexibility as well that we need

403
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,440
to be more flexible

404
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
and not all of our guys they were kind

405
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
of rooting the process they're not all

406
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
good at doing yoga or moving

407
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,440
some of those transitions so the

408
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,519
flexibility was in between

409
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,040
but we did that agile compliance we

410
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,200
worked to get to that agile compliance

411
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,959
and we worked to that at the same time

412
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,720
to doing risk operations managing our

413
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,279
risk

414
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,720
and always talking about risk in the

415
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,440
same manner and being able to talk about

416
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,200
how we were effective in that risk or

417
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,959
where that risk structure

418
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,760
as we move forward

419
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
so the third option like i mentioned for

420
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,600
us was that buying a solution

421
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,800
and everybody knows that you can go out

422
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,079
there and buy a solution there's lots of

423
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,839
contractors all over the place

424
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,200
if you've been in cyber security for any

425
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
length of time i'm sure at least a third

426
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,120
of your emails if not more coming in are

427
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,160
from vendors

428
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,440
and they offer a lot of good products

429
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,959
and there's a lot of good things out

430
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,760
there

431
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,120
nowadays that you can get in these

432
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
product scapes uh

433
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
that'll help you and they'll help move

434
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,240
your process forward and they'll make

435
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,920
you more effective and deliver value to

436
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,959
your process

437
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,320
from the beginning to the end so

438
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,680
they fall into kind of different scopes

439
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
and the first scope is really a who

440
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,480
wants to sell method

441
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,000
and you get the scaled agile framework

442
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
for enterprise it used to be scaled

443
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
agile for enterprise now it's a scaled

444
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
agile framework

445
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
uh for enterprise and the government is

446
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,399
using that they're using it a lot

447
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,839
they've bought this big framework that

448
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
goes in and it gives them a structure

449
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,639
that they can use when they start

450
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,880
talking about implementing agile and

451
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
implementing a devops mindset to move

452
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
forward

453
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,760
but it does cost and it costs to get

454
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,120
trained people and it costs to get the

455
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,399
training experience

456
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
and to bring them in and the next step

457
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
you get disciplined agile right

458
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
discipline agile is from the pmi

459
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,040
institute

460
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,800
uh and i'm a program management

461
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
professional so you know full disclosure

462
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,880
there

463
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
i've seen discipline agilent's way of

464
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
again taking that agile mindset

465
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
and building it onto a structure so that

466
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
when a big company like the government

467
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
comes in and says hey you know what

468
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
uh i need something and i need a

469
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,040
framework but i'm not ready to give up

470
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
all my culture to get to that framework

471
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
to get to that agile compliance

472
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,240
it kind of kind of helped them along the

473
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
process then you see deloitte and other

474
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
companies who will come in

475
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,519
uh and they'll bring a consultant in the

476
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,639
consultant will tell you everything

477
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,760
you're doing wrong and everything you're

478
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,720
doing right

479
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,920
with more emphasis on what you're doing

480
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
wrong and tie you in for a long-term

481
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,240
contract

482
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,600
and it'll get you in the process it'll

483
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,120
get you to agile compliance to get you

484
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
to risk operations all along the way

485
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,959
uh so that you can do the right things

486
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
uh it makes success and have value in

487
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,959
your organization

488
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,760
you get overlays itel and cmmi are both

489
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
great organizations and they both

490
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,680
both offer good quality products but

491
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,279
still buying someone else's overlaying

492
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,639
depending that they're answering the

493
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,320
right questions for your organization to

494
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,279
move forward

495
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,040
in a mix of these is helpful and

496
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
understanding all of these is helpful

497
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
and you see sre certifications working

498
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,720
with the devops institute

499
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,639
that site reliability engineer those are

500
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,920
good functions and those are good

501
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,519
effective functions

502
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,160
that help people do good things and they

503
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
build in value throughout your

504
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,959
organization by having that development

505
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,839
from ops

506
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,279
all the way through security all the way

507
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,040
into depth but you have to be able to

508
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
understand what you have to talk about

509
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,920
and sometimes that's working through the

510
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,440
process first and getting to the first

511
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,079
steps

512
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
uh before you find out that you need an

513
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,760
actual asberry certification you

514
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,279
actually need one of these overlays from

515
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,519
somebody else

516
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,800
and then you see people who are just

517
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
selling experts right i'm not going to

518
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,360
give you an overlay

519
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,639
instead i'll give you an expert i'll

520
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,160
sell you an expert that expert can go

521
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
into your organization

522
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,199
and when they get to your organization

523
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,399
they're going to help you fix everything

524
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,519
that's wrong with them

525
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,720
you see this from a lot of staffing

526
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,160
agencies you also see it from government

527
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,600
contractors which i can't complain too

528
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,480
much because we've come in as a

529
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,760
government contractor

530
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,320
although i do have to mention uh in all

531
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
fairness as we talk about our government

532
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,240
contract

533
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
situation we took over from a previous

534
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
set of contracts the previous set of

535
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
contracts

536
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
for the weapon program we're doing the

537
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
cyber vulnerability analysis weapon

538
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,440
program

539
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,800
had three different contracts for three

540
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,839
different companies and they had one

541
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,279
contract doing maintenance one contract

542
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,880
doing sustainment one contract doing

543
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,920
development

544
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
well when our company technical

545
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
corporation came in we took over all

546
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,320
three of those contracts and blended

547
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
them together

548
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,040
which is working for us so far so good

549
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,240
as we'll mention some of the other

550
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,760
slides but better than the previous

551
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,480
three

552
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,519
where none of those contracts were

553
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,800
willing to talk to each other to get the

554
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,160
maintenance and sustainment development

555
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,040
all done

556
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,480
in conjunction in time to get to

557
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
something where they could actually have

558
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
an agile compliance

559
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
and a risk operation along the way

560
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
so how do we discover fixes how do we

561
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,440
get there with these problems in this

562
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,000
framework

563
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,720
around what we need to do how do we find

564
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,279
out

565
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,959
what it is that we need to fix where we

566
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,320
need to fix it and find an

567
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,279
effective way to move us forward in what

568
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:21,839
it is

569
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,959
and the first thing is adaptive

570
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,880
philosophy right it always boils down

571
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,760
vaginal and devops in sre that you have

572
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,279
to have an effective culture

573
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,120
and that means you need to start both

574
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
small for the culture from the bottom up

575
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
as well as from the top down both sides

576
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,399
have a culture and you have to meet

577
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,000
those cultures in

578
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,759
with our security team when we sat down

579
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
to adopt the philosophy i came in from

580
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,240
an outside program

581
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
the previous three individuals on our

582
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,680
security team were already there

583
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,360
so they already kind of had a philosophy

584
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,639
from that organization from their

585
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,000
previous waterfall setup

586
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,519
and what we wanted to do was we wanted

587
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,199
to move it into that

588
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,680
that kind of devops agile mindset and

589
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,279
that meant who are we serving where are

590
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,639
we building value where are we

591
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,519
delivering

592
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
uh effectiveness into the organization

593
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,199
uh through this value philosophy through

594
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,880
this devops and the value stream that

595
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
goes to the devops as we move forward

596
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
we talked about first that we have

597
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,360
security user storage who uses security

598
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,680
right

599
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,920
who needs to use our security products

600
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,160
who needs to use those security features

601
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,759
and the first thought is well the devs

602
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,959
are the users right because they

603
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,320
actually have to get the security we

604
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
have to convince them to build the

605
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,800
security and we have to convince them to

606
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,839
put the security

607
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,199
both in their products and in their

608
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,680
pipelines uh and in their deliverables

609
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
so they're part of the user that are

610
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,839
using our stories when we say we need

611
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,120
this to be effective

612
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,240
because in the government in a

613
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,560
bureaucracy in a compliance if we don't

614
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,759
do all those things that we need for

615
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,800
compliance

616
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
and an outside organization comes and

617
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,279
says hey you know what you're not

618
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,240
compliant

619
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,759
they can shut us down and they can pull

620
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,000
it back and that's not good for anybody

621
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,360
most of all the devs because there's a

622
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,639
lot of them and because they put a lot

623
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,000
of hard work in

624
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,839
trying to get the process forward and

625
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,120
trying to make it

626
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
work on a daily basis so what do we see

627
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,839
about the devs well the devs

628
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,320
also have their user stories right and

629
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,319
they see security as an enabler

630
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,679
so we have to work through that mindset

631
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,000
that we enable them to do more effective

632
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,559
things

633
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,160
uh when we give them good security we

634
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
allow them to deliver more value

635
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,880
uh all across the way with those

636
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,160
effective things

637
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,839
and how do we get them to talk to us on

638
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,520
a regular basis how do we integrate with

639
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,799
them on a regular basis

640
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,160
uh and that has to be part of our

641
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
mindset too security historically in a

642
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,520
waterfall

643
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,240
sometimes has a bad reputation or a bad

644
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,919
experience of constantly being known but

645
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,520
being the culture of know that we only

646
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
say no

647
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,000
because we're just trying to get

648
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
compliant

649
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
but we're not really just trying to get

650
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
compliant we're trying to do the things

651
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,720
our value for us that our organization

652
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,559
has told us value but we need to

653
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,520
integrate to get past that process

654
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,039
to get into the place where we can do

655
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,799
the good things for everyone

656
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,240
and then we have a product owner store

657
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,679
right the person who owns the business

658
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,280
the customer who's getting that end goal

659
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,240
value

660
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
from the entire stream uh and that has

661
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
to be the compliance adds value

662
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,640
we have to be compliant to add value and

663
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,240
they have to value the new things of

664
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
compliance and the new security and that

665
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,440
agile compliance that comes in through

666
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,400
that security

667
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,960
is just as valuable as putting in a new

668
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,280
feature that new feature loses value

669
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
if you don't have the security and

670
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
compliance built in all the way across

671
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,200
the process

672
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,440
to get you achieved and we started to do

673
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
that when we were thinking about it but

674
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
how do we manage risk how do we operate

675
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
through risk

676
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
instead of just saying we're managing we

677
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
want to talk about risk operations

678
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
because we want to talk about this

679
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,679
change in the cycle

680
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,840
in this process that goes through to be

681
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,440
able to effectively talk through our

682
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,039
risk processes

683
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,520
with a number of different people and a

684
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
number of different factors

685
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,880
so we have to be able to manage multiple

686
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,160
users we have to be able to manage

687
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,760
multiple users all the time in order to

688
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,880
manage those users

689
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,480
we have to be familiar with those users

690
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
part of that is integrating into those

691
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,640
teams

692
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
and making sure that we had security

693
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,679
reps in those teams

694
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,799
a lot of times i'll tell you about

695
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,640
security champions and using a security

696
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,440
champion

697
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
designating someone to represent

698
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,720
security for your team

699
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,400
and that may work as you get larger and

700
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,840
larger but when you have small teams and

701
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
only a certain number of deadlines

702
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,960
i think it works better to get your

703
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
security team in there every day

704
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,000
i get the experience and get the

705
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
face-to-face and we need to be able to

706
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
suggest those solutions in those

707
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,080
face-to-face

708
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,320
experiences by uh talking without

709
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,280
leveraging

710
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,880
right we can't say this is what you have

711
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,000
to do and if you don't do it we're going

712
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,039
to shut you down

713
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,320
we're going to cut it down right here

714
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,080
instead we have to listen to what the

715
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
developers are putting forward

716
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,799
now what they need to do and suggest

717
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,400
how they can find ways to make that go

718
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,760
through compliance and how they can make

719
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
that compliant

720
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,400
in the process and hopefully that gives

721
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
us some long-term success with the

722
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,440
short-term compliance

723
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,840
and that having an effective process and

724
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,360
having effective people that are

725
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,320
integrated and they're

726
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,960
talking to deliver functional software

727
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
helps us meet the compliance

728
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
all the way through so that we can do

729
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
this easy things in small steps

730
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,360
and then use automation to round those

731
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
up together so we can meet those

732
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
compliance standards at the barns

733
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,000
with our thousands and thousands of

734
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
controls

735
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
so what was our security team problems

736
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
and what were some of the solutions

737
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
along the way

738
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,480
so with a new contract the first

739
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,240
question was where do i start

740
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,280
right what occurred before we came in we

741
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,360
came into this new government space

742
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,799
in working in the government space our

743
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,799
first problem was access a lot of these

744
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,679
government programs are

745
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,440
blocked when you see that you have to

746
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,480
get access to the government the

747
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,559
government wants certain

748
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,240
things to be filled out before you get

749
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
into those spaces you have to have the

750
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,400
paperwork

751
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,880
you have to have what's done i always

752
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,919
say and i always work

753
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,919
that when you work with programs when

754
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,039
you work with software when you work

755
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,799
with any process really in any type of

756
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,240
operation

757
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,159
change creates error but indecision

758
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,360
creates disaster

759
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,679
you have to be able to make the small uh

760
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,720
changes

761
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
along the way to do things you have to

762
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,320
make small decisions in small increments

763
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
and without the access at first without

764
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
the access to the old compliance

765
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
standards that was what we did

766
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
we went back to the basic security

767
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
practices we went back to the basics of

768
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
what was happening how was it happening

769
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,360
were we making sure that we were doing

770
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,080
the right things

771
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
we have all the users integrated we have

772
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
all the users uh passwords

773
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,360
we have the secrets protected we have

774
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,720
our facilities not just locked down but

775
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,799
blocked out in certain ways that we can

776
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,600
make the standards

777
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,000
so we were making these small decisions

778
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,919
into these small increments

779
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,720
along the way uh and then the next step

780
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
for us was do we understand the tools at

781
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,679
hand do we have the right

782
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,080
tools in the places the government came

783
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,799
in

784
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,840
and processed it to us that we were able

785
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,200
to do the right things and that

786
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,039
we saw them as effective

787
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,840
in the process so we had to challenge

788
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,200
the old models because the old model was

789
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,000
waterfall

790
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,520
and the waterfall development of being

791
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
able to deliver in five years

792
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,440
was no longer affected so we had to look

793
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,640
at the new tools so that we could get

794
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,400
new cycles out we could test the new

795
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
tools

796
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,679
we looked at things like di2e which is a

797
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,720
framework of

798
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,240
developer defense intelligence

799
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960
integration to enterprise uh trello

800
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
which is the boards for workflow

801
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,480
clara which is a container standard

802
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,760
sonar cube which is a code scanner a

803
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,000
sas tool a static analysis security tool

804
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
on salt stack it's integration

805
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,480
management

806
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
we were finding ways to integrate those

807
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,919
we were finding ways that we even used

808
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,240
that we

809
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,919
shifted from a jenkins to a git lab in

810
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,840
the earlier formats so that we could get

811
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
more pipeline built in and more that

812
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,720
cicd framework uh built in along the

813
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
process

814
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,960
but some of that was learning for us

815
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,000
some of that was learning that the

816
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,200
security team had to go back and

817
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,120
challenge their previous assumptions

818
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,559
and sit down with the devs and say

819
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,840
this is what it is and this is what

820
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,919
we're doing this how we use it i can't

821
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,520
even mention with gitlab that gitlab is

822
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,159
a great tool

823
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,400
we love using gitlab but uh one of our

824
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,159
first debates with the guys over gitlab

825
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,280
was that they said hey we're going to

826
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,559
gitlab we said that's great

827
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,919
uh when you move from jenkins and you're

828
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,520
moving out to gitlab gitlab has these

829
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
great security dashboards we want to see

830
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
those security dashboards

831
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,880
we want to be able to get those metrics

832
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,080
and look at you

833
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,679
and use those metrics right because

834
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,120
those metrics are great those metrics

835
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
will give us so much of the security

836
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,520
compliance information

837
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,799
that we can automate and we don't have

838
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,080
to go bug you all the time for this

839
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,840
information

840
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,919
and the devs came back and said yeah

841
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,120
that's nice but we only bought the

842
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,559
bronze package and the bronze package

843
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,080
doesn't include the security dashboard

844
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,480
so

845
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,000
you're gonna have to wait till next time

846
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,919
uh so instead we have i mean we're still

847
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,000
working through a process

848
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,360
for that but hopefully we'll be able to

849
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
get some more success with it along the

850
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,600
way

851
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,799
and at least we've got our pipeline

852
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,880
metrics and with that pipeline we've got

853
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,039
the tools in the process right so

854
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,360
talking through how you get to that

855
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,960
agile compliance if you can go through

856
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,400
to that compliance guy

857
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
and you can say hey in that compliance

858
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,000
with the tools i've got

859
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
i get every time code gets checked in i

860
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,679
get a number of scans i get a number of

861
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,559
processes

862
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,200
i get that that static code analysis at

863
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,640
the beginning and at the end i get that

864
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,400
dynamic analysis of how it goes into the

865
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,120
platform

866
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,640
and i get the scan of everything that's

867
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,360
matching up as well as i get a stig

868
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
which is a government framework for a

869
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,039
secure technical implementation guidance

870
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,240
it tells you all the things you need to

871
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
do with every tool

872
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,640
to make sure it's compliant so you use

873
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,320
the stakes did you apply all the stings

874
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,880
affected

875
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,720
we can go and say hey not only is this

876
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,480
being done because you came in audit but

877
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,919
we're doing this for ourselves and we're

878
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,039
doing it every day

879
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,360
uh and i've got this whole stack of data

880
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,120
so that when the auditor comes in

881
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
uh i can say i've already got it for you

882
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,799
right it's already there

883
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,640
uh and it's what we have and that blends

884
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,919
into that next part

885
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,159
can you see what you need to do are you

886
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,440
able to work transparently and

887
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,640
communicate often

888
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,360
uh again we see security a lot of times

889
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
a lot of old security practices what

890
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,919
happens is

891
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,799
that security comes back behind a

892
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,000
blocker behind wall

893
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
nobody wants to talk about the security

894
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
nobody wants to talk about the

895
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,400
vulnerabilities nobody wants to talk

896
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,039
about

897
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,440
uh what's wrong we don't see it as wrong

898
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,039
but it is potential for fix

899
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,039
it is potential to improve and to do

900
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,799
better by being able to work

901
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,559
transparently we have to be transparent

902
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,159
about what we're looking for

903
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,520
just as much as we need them to be

904
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,799
transparent about what they're working

905
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,919
on

906
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,440
and what the factors of them actually

907
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,159
working with that process are

908
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,520
and that's part of that communication

909
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,080
often how do we get to a process

910
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,120
where we communicate often enough

911
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,159
um that we get what we need and not only

912
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,480
that

913
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,320
the developers keep thinking that we're

914
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,120
involved and embedded in those teams

915
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,200
and right now we do we have somebody in

916
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,720
one of their teams every day we have

917
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,240
four or three development teams and an

918
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,919
engineering architecture team

919
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,520
and with four security guys we have one

920
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,120
person on each of those teams

921
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,799
uh every day sitting in their screens

922
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,720
offering them advice uh when they need

923
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:38,960
it

924
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,080
because a lot of times they don't need

925
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,279
it a lot of times they can do their own

926
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,960
thing but then taking that information

927
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,400
back and building a consulate

928
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
consolidated security picture of how

929
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,919
everything works

930
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,200
along the way so this leads to the next

931
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
step which is it's not just about us

932
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,400
right it's not just about my security

933
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,039
team it's not

934
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,960
just about that development team or this

935
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
ops team or that functional underwear

936
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,480
we have to have a organizational

937
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,000
solution

938
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,200
we have to be able to make the culture

939
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
change both from the top up in the

940
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,760
bottom

941
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,480
bottom up in the top down to deliver a

942
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,559
process where we can build those good

943
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,400
teams and we need to be able to work

944
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,440
through those

945
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,960
through that leadership structure all

946
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,120
along the way and that's a challenge and

947
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,960
it's a challenge for a lot of people

948
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,039
but if you invest in the people and you

949
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,799
harvest that process you harvest the

950
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,320
good things that come out of the people

951
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,360
because it's people over processes but

952
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,640
you have to have the right people and

953
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,559
having the right people build processes

954
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,440
along the way

955
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,279
you have to take the people first and

956
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,960
know that the developer is important and

957
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
that person is important and that lets

958
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
you get to the point where you have a

959
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
good process

960
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,120
by working through there and building a

961
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,200
team that depends not just on their own

962
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,600
team

963
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,120
but that every other team is functioning

964
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
along the same way

965
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,200
so we talk about being able to integrate

966
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
we talk about being able to

967
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,120
beat the street right now i say beat the

968
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,480
street because i had a good senior

969
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,159
leader come back to me one time

970
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,520
he mentioned that uh somebody asked him

971
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,360
why he repeated the same thing over and

972
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,720
over when he did talk they said they'd

973
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,600
seen him talk

974
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
in three or four different places and he

975
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,559
said the same thing every time and he

976
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,799
said the same three things every time

977
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,799
and his response when he came back was

978
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,120
that ten percent of the people

979
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
who hear me hear ten percent of what i

980
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,720
say 10 of the time

981
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,159
they said he figured if that happened he

982
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,240
had to say the same thing 30 times

983
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,760
before he could effectively depend on

984
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,279
one person hearing him once

985
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,559
uh and the same thing applies to

986
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,760
security and same thing applies to

987
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,480
develop

988
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,760
when we go through and we want to talk

989
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,279
about security we need to say the same

990
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,480
thing and we need to be on the same

991
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,200
message

992
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,559
if we're constantly changing our

993
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,399
security message and we're constantly

994
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,760
changing how that security message is

995
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,120
going to affect value

996
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,559
then we can't manage our risk and we

997
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,640
can't be agilely compliant

998
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,399
because somebody will hear a different

999
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,159
thing every time we get there and

1000
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,840
they've got a lot of stuff to do

1001
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,000
just like we do the devs have a lot of

1002
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
things that they need to take care of

1003
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,039
so if they only hear part of the message

1004
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,960
part of the time then we don't get to an

1005
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,720
effective security platform along the

1006
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,520
way

1007
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,039
and that translates into building

1008
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,120
transparency as well

1009
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,640
having that transparency all along the

1010
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
way being able to visualize workflow

1011
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,320
and be able to go and see what everyone

1012
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
is doing keeps you from having to track

1013
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,000
that person down and say hey i need you

1014
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,039
to tell me

1015
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,720
because you can see it for yourself and

1016
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
you can see it from the beginning to the

1017
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,120
end of the process

1018
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
across the pipeline and that's a lot of

1019
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,720
what that flow and feedback is in that

1020
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,640
devops mode being able to have a clear

1021
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,200
flow

1022
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
and get clear feedback all across the

1023
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,320
step and that's what we're working

1024
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,080
towards with this agile compliance risk

1025
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,360
operations

1026
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,480
and then we need to be able to link

1027
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,399
items and tasks

1028
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,080
you have to be able to take the item and

1029
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,559
when you see it know how security fits

1030
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,320
it and know that security is part of it

1031
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,039
all the time

1032
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,840
just like the operation of it having

1033
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,480
those acceptance criteria and those

1034
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,320
definitions are done built in across the

1035
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
way that let you get where you need to

1036
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,960
be

1037
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
by linking those items together and

1038
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,279
having a backlog of what you need to get

1039
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:53,679
to

1040
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,360
sometimes security is not the most

1041
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,760
important priority i know that sacrilege

1042
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,200
a lot of people on the security teams i

1043
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
know that's sacrilege a lot of people

1044
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,840
have worked it but

1045
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,440
sometimes because of that exposure

1046
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
because of that risk management

1047
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,960
you can put security in the backlog and

1048
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,240
it can come up the next time

1049
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
or the time after that or the time after

1050
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
that it has to be done before

1051
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,840
compliance but what is your compliance

1052
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,760
framework when is somebody else going to

1053
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,080
check

1054
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,600
and what is your risk if you actually

1055
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
let that security go and say hey

1056
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,960
you know what we have a ci cd i'm going

1057
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,480
to fix it the next time because

1058
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
it's more important to get that feature

1059
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,159
out now and that leads to the

1060
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,080
prioritization how do we prioritize

1061
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,960
those things

1062
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,159
along the way for security so once we

1063
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,600
have the organizational solutions what

1064
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,880
are those takeaways what are the things

1065
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,399
we learned from doing this

1066
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,120
uh all along the way as we're moving our

1067
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,240
process forward

1068
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,159
uh and the first is practice practice

1069
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,520
practice right uh

1070
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,080
agile is a skill agile compliance is a

1071
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,159
skill security is a skill coding is a

1072
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:48,880
skill

1073
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,799
uh there's a great paper by a gentleman

1074
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,320
named malcolm gladwell who's

1075
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,399
written a lot of stuff on the process uh

1076
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,600
it may actually be a book called

1077
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,200
outliers that was written in the 90s one

1078
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,320
of the things he talks about was the

1079
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,360
number of times

1080
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,279
you have to achieve deliberate practice

1081
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,440
to be considered good at something

1082
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,960
and those numbers wind up looking like

1083
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,200
500 times you have to be able to repeat

1084
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,600
it 500 times for familiarity about 5 000

1085
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,480
times for

1086
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,720
some basic level of competence about 50

1087
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,480
000 times for mastery

1088
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,919
and it has to be deliberate practice

1089
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,440
which means you have to concentrate on

1090
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,559
those right things that you're doing

1091
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,399
to be able to uh move forward

1092
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,440
um and it's difficult if you think about

1093
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,640
doing the sprint if you think about

1094
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,440
doing your

1095
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,159
your basic scrum meeting that you do

1096
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:32,720
every day

1097
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,399
you spend 15 minutes doing every day and

1098
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,200
you probably do it 280 times a year

1099
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,120
if that and if you need to be able to do

1100
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,960
that 50 000 times before you consider

1101
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,039
you're effective at that you really have

1102
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,640
to practice you have to take advantage

1103
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
of every opportunity

1104
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,679
as an opportunity to practice an

1105
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,120
opportunity to get that continuous

1106
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,000
learning from that third

1107
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,279
way and move it forward so we practice

1108
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,960
we practice a lot we try to talk about

1109
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,240
what we practice when we practice

1110
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,519
through our screens we practice through

1111
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,440
our retros and we practice through our

1112
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,799
reviews of what we're doing

1113
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,240
so that we can find a way to get to the

1114
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,399
agile compliance and this risk

1115
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,080
operations

1116
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
and then we say through that as we're

1117
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,360
learning we never stop learning

1118
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,799
we never stop learning about how we

1119
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,960
manage our backlog how we prioritize

1120
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,880
and why it's important to prioritize and

1121
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
that's the integration of people

1122
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,960
that's the communication along the way

1123
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,640
that actual communication that you have

1124
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,519
to get there

1125
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,360
and value those people over processes

1126
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
you have to value change over a plan

1127
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
a compliance is a plan and it tells you

1128
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,960
to do one thing

1129
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,559
but we want to value the change so how

1130
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,880
do we change to meet the compliance

1131
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,240
to manage our risk and be able to

1132
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,480
prioritize and through that we take the

1133
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,399
time to innovate

1134
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,440
and adapt our processes so they fit

1135
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,960
better the next time and they fit

1136
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,399
better into the things that we're trying

1137
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,120
to do as we move forward and i can't see

1138
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,840
ah there we go and the last one is we

1139
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,200
have to advocate i talked about

1140
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,279
advocating b will be the street

1141
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,559
you have to constantly go out there and

1142
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,240
convince others if we're not doing it

1143
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,720
ourselves

1144
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,279
if we're not enthusiastic and passionate

1145
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,039
about the process of our security

1146
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,919
then we're not going to be able to

1147
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,519
convince other people right because

1148
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,279
everybody's passionate about their own

1149
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,480
they're passionate about what they're

1150
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,200
doing it's building that passion into a

1151
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,640
broader view that we're passionate not

1152
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,760
just about our thing

1153
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,519
but we're passionate about delivering

1154
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,279
value to the organization

1155
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,039
we deliver that value through convincing

1156
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,039
others that compliance is a good thing

1157
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,720
that getting to this agile compliance

1158
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,320
that it's not going to slow them down

1159
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
security is not going to break them but

1160
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,679
it's going to move them forward to the

1161
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,880
right pieces

1162
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,600
that they need to deliver success uh all

1163
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,640
along the way

1164
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,240
uh and with that we have to build

1165
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,840
relationships over processes i mean

1166
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,200
that's agile one

1167
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
in pro building those relationships

1168
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,399
takes time and building those

1169
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,159
relationships in a secure manner takes

1170
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:44,960
time

1171
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,559
so that they trust us as experts that

1172
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,840
they trust that we're coming to them

1173
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,799
with the right things

1174
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,240
that we're coming to them with the right

1175
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,399
notes and as we have those notes

1176
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,760
we're moving forward and doing our

1177
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,480
things and sometimes that means doing

1178
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,080
the compliance stuff behind the board

1179
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,120
right

1180
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,559
they want to talk about having a demo

1181
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,320
they want to talk about having what the

1182
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,240
next functional software delivery is

1183
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,440
and all you've done is address how

1184
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,720
they've done the controls but when

1185
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,159
you've automated those things

1186
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,519
you've taken that work off of the

1187
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,039
development plate you've taken that work

1188
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,559
off of the coding plate

1189
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,159
your success is that you've given them

1190
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,720
more time to do the functional software

1191
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,880
uh and granted that doesn't demo well uh

1192
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,320
but it helps to build the relationship

1193
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,440
when you come back and say hey you know

1194
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,120
what we're good and you don't have to do

1195
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,080
it as often

1196
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,799
because we've done one of these things

1197
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,120
and so

1198
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,519
as we move forward from that one of the

1199
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,720
things i like to talk about is being

1200
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,080
king for the day right everybody likes

1201
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,960
to think about

1202
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,679
what would i do if i was in charge how

1203
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,440
would i make things better immediately

1204
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,480
what would i immediately fix to make it

1205
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,840
to the next step to make sure that we

1206
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,120
were actually compliant

1207
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,720
that we managed our risk that we were

1208
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,159
delivering effective processes

1209
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,240
for the way and here move security

1210
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,760
processes

1211
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,279
and i want to move security processes to

1212
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,880
the left i want to move as much to the

1213
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,080
left as possible

1214
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,440
and i want to move them to the left so

1215
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,360
that i can integrate software so i can

1216
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,880
make things quicker so that i can allow

1217
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,840
humans to do more human things

1218
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,079
because we're automating more things

1219
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,520
along the process

1220
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,359
and that automation is key in getting

1221
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,800
those results

1222
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,280
in being able to flood the

1223
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,440
uh the auditors or the inspectors with

1224
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,359
the degree of data to which you're doing

1225
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,079
these things

1226
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,760
we talked about being able to do a

1227
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,359
continuous integration continuous

1228
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,960
delivery but part of that is continuous

1229
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,679
monitoring

1230
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,960
that everything that comes out of that

1231
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,879
pipeline delivers an artifact

1232
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,239
and every one of those artifacts has

1233
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,399
potential uh security value or not

1234
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,639
security value but compliance value

1235
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,239
and being able to manage those things to

1236
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,679
show compliance

1237
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,599
all the way across the process and being

1238
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,040
able to understand what's coming out of

1239
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,918
your pipeline

1240
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,399
to show that process uh to expedite that

1241
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,119
security and

1242
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,040
onboard the people effect uh

1243
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
the better i can integrate the better i

1244
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,879
can move the security to the left

1245
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,760
uh the better process i have in getting

1246
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,440
the right data in the right place at the

1247
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,839
right time

1248
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,680
i had a story that was sliding in mind

1249
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,640
but we continue moving that that

1250
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,599
pipeline up and

1251
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,040
that's the speeds up in the pipeline

1252
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,880
to get our our process in the right

1253
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,760
place where we need to go

1254
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,000
then next we want to be able to move 30

1255
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,040
checks to the right

1256
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,200
so both as we say move security to the

1257
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,400
left we want to move

1258
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,599
security to the right because we want to

1259
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,079
have

1260
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,480
compliance as acceptance criteria right

1261
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,280
we want to have

1262
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
security to the right to the fact when

1263
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
they're done they're thinking about it

1264
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,040
and saying hey i'm done

1265
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,839
and this is good because it includes

1266
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,960
security it includes security all the

1267
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,119
way

1268
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,599
all the way is the process is being done

1269
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,560
how do we get the the devs to include

1270
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
that how do we talk to them enough that

1271
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,520
they think about security

1272
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,960
as part of the process they think when

1273
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,480
they want to include something they come

1274
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,520
to us and say hey

1275
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,720
i need to include this and i want to

1276
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,119
have security and that talks about trust

1277
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,720
and that talks about people that talks

1278
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,599
about interactions

1279
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,400
you used to hear ronald reagan talk back

1280
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
in the 80s you used to say trust but

1281
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,359
verify

1282
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,760
you have to trust but verify so we trust

1283
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,119
all our developers we trust that they're

1284
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,240
going to do the right things and we

1285
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,000
verify through the tools and we verify

1286
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,119
through that knowledge

1287
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,119
and we verify through scans one of the

1288
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,400
processes we put in is

1289
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
they do all their scans in the pipeline

1290
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,000
and one that when they've done their

1291
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,440
scans and when they've done their checks

1292
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,119
and when it's all done and it's gone

1293
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,800
into delivery we're ready to pull that

1294
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,920
into production

1295
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,440
the next step is we go back and run our

1296
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,040
own scans against it we

1297
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,800
run our own scans in the process is it

1298
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,079
sitting in production waiting for that

1299
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,040
next poll

1300
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,560
so that doesn't slow them down it

1301
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,160
doesn't stop them but it's a

1302
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,359
verification

1303
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,400
that we verified that our process is

1304
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,920
matched up against their process and you

1305
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,040
know what the numbers they got from

1306
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,400
their tools are the same as the number

1307
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,119
weeks

1308
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,200
numbers we got from our tools and that's

1309
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,720
how we do things effectively

1310
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,200
that's how we do things uh in the right

1311
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,720
way so that we make sure that security

1312
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,160
is doing the right things and security

1313
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,560
is doing the right processes

1314
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
and those are integrated processes those

1315
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
processes take everybody those processes

1316
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,359
take

1317
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,920
uh the right value to build value for

1318
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,599
the organization to stick to our goals

1319
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,760
to stick to our vision move

1320
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
uh one of the personal pet peeves i have

1321
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,960
is you always talk to people when people

1322
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,320
say the meeting is boring

1323
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,599
meeting is important i want less

1324
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,880
meetings i don't want i don't want to

1325
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,440
talk

1326
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,760
all my meetings are boring in

1327
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,079
a side point i don't think any meeting

1328
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:32,800
is boring

1329
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
i don't think any meeting where i can go

1330
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,599
and learn something from the people

1331
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,160
there

1332
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,599
and being able to interact with the

1333
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,599
people there and create value and create

1334
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,560
a process

1335
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,880
is boring if you go into the meetings if

1336
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,200
you set an agenda for the meeting

1337
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,920
or if the person has an agenda set then

1338
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,000
you can get effective things done

1339
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,280
through those meetings you can get an

1340
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
effective process and you can learn

1341
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,640
about the people and you can get better

1342
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,599
interaction

1343
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,440
you can get that collaboration you need

1344
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,040
you can get that change you need

1345
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,520
by talking about effective things and

1346
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,960
that ties into the other half of

1347
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,320
security that no one's issue is ever

1348
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,240
unnecessary a lot of people

1349
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,520
i don't want to worry about your issue i

1350
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,200
don't want to worry about your issue

1351
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,720
just like no meeting is boring

1352
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,480
no one's issues are necessary everybody

1353
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,920
has a reason they are putting their

1354
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,200
issue forward and they have something

1355
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,240
they need to get done and something

1356
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,599
that's valuable for them

1357
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,040
you need to be able to recognize their

1358
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,480
value and you need to be able to

1359
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,160
prioritize but you need to

1360
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,720
address across the entire scope of those

1361
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,440
factors

1362
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,640
but there are things that we get done

1363
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,359
to make things happen in a way the best

1364
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,200
measures everybody and best helps

1365
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,160
everyone

1366
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,480
uh to move forward so we try to address

1367
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,160
everyone's security concerns we try to

1368
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,599
address everyone's security concerns

1369
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,599
along the way

1370
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,720
and make sure that we're talking about

1371
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,680
how those things work

1372
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,440
and what they have and what they need

1373
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,720
and what their goals are um

1374
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,160
one of the biggest pet peeves is people

1375
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,240
will run in and they will go hey we have

1376
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,000
this uh this new cve just popped

1377
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,880
up and we have this critical

1378
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,960
vulnerability on one of the systems we

1379
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,839
use and

1380
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,359
or one of the systems we're planning on

1381
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,680
using and it's back behind all these vpn

1382
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,119
firewalls but we haven't we have to

1383
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,560
patch it right now

1384
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
so well if you want to patch it you know

1385
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
we know what the patch is do you have

1386
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,359
any capacity passion

1387
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,200
they say no we can't patch it for three

1388
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,560
sprints but it needs to be patched right

1389
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,640
now and this is a security problem

1390
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,800
so well you know we've kind of already

1391
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,320
had that discussion if you haven't

1392
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,599
prioritized it you don't want to

1393
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,920
prioritize it to right now

1394
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,000
then it is a security problem let's talk

1395
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,440
about it as a security problem let's put

1396
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
it on our compliance center

1397
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,880
but we're not going to fix it for three

1398
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,960
sprints and if that's what we work with

1399
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,560
you know that's what we work with as we

1400
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,960
move forward

1401
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,160
so we have to address everyone's

1402
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,240
concerns and we can't be uh dismissive

1403
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,119
about it

1404
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,800
uh one of the other frameworks we have

1405
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,880
in that same type of mindset one of the

1406
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,160
things that's happened to me on occasion

1407
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,520
is our engineer comes up with the same

1408
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,800
type of question right he comes up and

1409
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,440
says hey

1410
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,040
we've got this great big cbe and we need

1411
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,800
to fix it we need to worry about it

1412
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,880
and you know what uh the security guys

1413
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,240
aren't doing a good enough job you guys

1414
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,440
need to be out there threat

1415
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,560
you need to be looking at the new

1416
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,920
malware you need to be looking at how

1417
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,359
that stuff is coming at us

1418
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,599
you need to be talking about our the new

1419
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,960
threats and the new vulnerabilities of

1420
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,319
the new processes

1421
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,319
uh in our conversation back a lot of

1422
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,000
times it's hey we talked about having

1423
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,280
these the secure technical

1424
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,720
implementation guides right these

1425
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,400
basic standards of security that you

1426
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,839
need to be able to do

1427
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,440
and you guys can't get to the basic

1428
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,920
standards and if you can't do the

1429
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,280
basic part that we've been asking for

1430
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,359
and i understand that you prioritize

1431
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,400
we have functions that we need to

1432
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,359
deliver but if the basics can't be done

1433
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,680
how do we get to the advanced part to

1434
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,640
move forward

1435
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,920
and that's that deliberate practice

1436
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,280
again that's working on those silver

1437
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,319
practices

1438
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,839
working on those deliberate practices

1439
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,839
all through the process so that we can

1440
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:44,720
manage our risk

1441
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,520
on threat exposure and not just

1442
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
vulnerability not just talk about where

1443
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,599
it's open

1444
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,599
but how do we reduce our exposure how do

1445
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,440
we reduce that attack surface that's out

1446
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,240
there

1447
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,720
so we can manage our threat so we can do

1448
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,480
our risk operation so that we can become

1449
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,839
agilely compliant

1450
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,040
and we can move along the way

1451
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,520
so i know i'm short of a little bit

1452
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,359
short of my hour time but i do have some

1453
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,359
questions

1454
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,960
so this is me this was agile compliance

1455
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,319
and risk operations there's some of my

1456
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,079
contact information

1457
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,359
i'll go back and i think i've got

1458
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,280
questions in a reverse order as we look

1459
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,000
at them

1460
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,280
so the first one is any framework

1461
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,640
recommendations for standing up an

1462
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,160
information security

1463
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,480
uh assurance program uh obviously

1464
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,839
there's good things for infosec all

1465
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:26,800
along the way

1466
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,480
uh being a government guy being a lot of

1467
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,359
time in government

1468
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,319
let's just move the window and create

1469
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,880
christ from the third application

1470
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,520
there we go this should be all clear

1471
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,440
enough but if there's recommendations

1472
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,760
i i like nist because i've been in the

1473
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,000
government it's kind of overdone

1474
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,599
but at least it gives you a good friend

1475
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,119
gives you some good discussions for how

1476
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,200
you stand up and how you think about

1477
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,119
uh what the risk is and what the

1478
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,319
vulnerability is

1479
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,040
uh being an intel guy i look at

1480
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,480
vulnerability as well and i start with

1481
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,319
some of those vulnerability questions

1482
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,640
and you start with things about um how

1483
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,319
do i know

1484
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,480
once you know how do you how do you

1485
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
prove that if that's true or what do you

1486
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,079
see next

1487
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,920
and if you see something next uh the

1488
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,520
next step is what are the assumptions

1489
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,440
that you need to make that true

1490
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,839
so nist 853 as i mentioned earlier is a

1491
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:18,720
great one

1492
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,800
for sending up that initial information

1493
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,560
security assurance program

1494
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,920
i'm sure if you look out there there's a

1495
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,599
lot of different things sans institute

1496
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,960
has a lot of good stuff

1497
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,280
about how to stand up an information

1498
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,240
security

1499
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,920
program and work through so i work back

1500
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,170
through

1501
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,480

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,599
questions working security

1503
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,880
found tools that assist you in the

1504
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,119
process there are

1505
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,640
all kinds of tools that will help us

1506
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,960
automate sonotype is a great one

1507
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,720
it will do things we have been working

1508
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
with salt to get a demo

1509
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,240
extensively because salt will do a lot

1510
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,119
of the automation for the infrastructure

1511
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,760
and we'll find ways that can

1512
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,359
automate the infrastructure but not just

1513
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,800
automate the infrastructure but automate

1514
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,240
the configuration management

1515
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
to do some of those tedious processes of

1516
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,839
keeping track of versions

1517
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,119
keeping track of updates through

1518
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,160
versions keeping track of

1519
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,480
um

1520
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,079
the compliance and the policy associated

1521
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:18,560
uh

1522
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,920
and not only that but we've talked with

1523
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,520
some of the users themselves who've been

1524
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
fairly happy with it

1525
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,160
and they can put it in and we'll

1526
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
institute a baseline configuration

1527
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,839
on their system and track and return

1528
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:28,960
everything to that baseline

1529
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,880
configuration

1530
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,800
and once it does if they had a custom

1531
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,920
configuration

1532
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,280
they can move it back and change it back

1533
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,920
to what they had as that custom setup

1534
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
and then you just manage it through that

1535
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,200
type of process

1536
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,800
um the yeah the tedious security

1537
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,400
checklists are long i mentioned

1538
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,560
nist 853 there's 19 families there's

1539
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,160
over a thousand controls

1540
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,920
uh some of it is just being able to talk

1541
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,280
and having your folks be comfortable

1542
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,240
with you that hey

1543
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,599
you know what you really don't have to

1544
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,359
answer all those questions or

1545
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,800
in looking at those questions and you

1546
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,480
being familiar with those questions you

1547
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,920
can talk to the security folks about how

1548
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,119
do you automate the tools in the

1549
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:03,920
pipeline

1550
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,880
they give you artifacts that answer

1551
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,560
those tools for you so you can just pump

1552
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,040
those

1553
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,520
those answers into those checklists as

1554
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,240
you move forward

1555
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,560
uh quantifiable details in the federal

1556
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,160
fiber space some of the kpis related to

1557
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,640
compliance risk management

1558
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,920
communicating the effectiveness of

1559
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,280
scaling agile over waterfall

1560
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,920
well so one of the biggest difficulties

1561
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
in the government space that we see

1562
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,839
is that the government

1563
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,520
wants to be waterfall they have a large

1564
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,480
bureaucratic process and they want to be

1565
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,359
agile

1566
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,240
when they say hey we want you to be

1567
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,839
agile we want you to do this devops

1568
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,240
thing

1569
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,599
and that means you're going to deliver

1570
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,160
our our new software our new functional

1571
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
software that we're really excited about

1572
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,520
and you're gonna deliver in three months

1573
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
right so sure great

1574
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,760
give me a full devops way to go we'll

1575
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,359
deliver your software in three months

1576
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,119
you give us all the resources we'll grid

1577
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,319
they say well that's great here's all

1578
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,960
the resources but by the way

1579
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,880
here's all these paperwork standards

1580
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,000
that you need to meet while you're doing

1581
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,280
the resources

1582
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,240
here's all these bureaucratic things

1583
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,920
that need to be answered

1584
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,359
while you go forward so we go into agile

1585
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,200
we go into this process for our own

1586
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,880
program and they say hey we need you to

1587
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,760
be agile

1588
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,200
we need you to start delivering we need

1589
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,040
you to start delivering good stuff but

1590
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,480
one of those first things we need to

1591
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,079
prove that you're agile is we need

1592
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,560
a 150 page system engineering management

1593
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,720
plan that describes exactly how you're

1594
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,440
agile

1595
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,000
in every phase of the process before you

1596
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,720
get a process up and running

1597
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,319
so that is difficult when you manage it

1598
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,079
obviously the the kpi the key

1599
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,359
performance indicator

1600
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,480
uh to compliance and risk management

1601
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,079
is just that we're doing it that you're

1602
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,560
making process that you're getting there

1603
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,160
that you're getting things like scans

1604
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,000
done that you're getting things like

1605
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,280
uh integration done uh i mentioned we

1606
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,720
took over from a previous company the

1607
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,240
previous company had the contract for

1608
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,160
about three years

1609
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,359
in that three years they had not

1610
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,560
delivered a a single release

1611
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,160
uh not one they were still working on

1612
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,200
the same version they had when they

1613
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,280
picked it up three years previously

1614
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,119
in the nine months our company has had

1615
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,480
the contract

1616
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,680
we delivered our first release our first

1617
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,280
update they're not major releases right

1618
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,720
minor releases

1619
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,720
is what they're calling them uh about

1620
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,560
three months in

1621
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,920
six months after that we delivered our

1622
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,839
second release about

1623
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,680
five months uh and we're on our way to

1624
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,280
delivering our third release

1625
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,920
uh here in the next month and a half um

1626
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,880
so while we

1627
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,319
gripe about all the small things that we

1628
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,240
have and all the problems we still have

1629
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,760
the fact is that it has turned into

1630
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
functional software and in addition to

1631
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,839
that functional software

1632
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,839
with the compliance we went into the

1633
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,040
process where we have scans in the

1634
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,000
pipeline

1635
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,680
previous was doing development work but

1636
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,800
they weren't doing a pipeline they

1637
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,560
weren't doing any type of ci cd pipeline

1638
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,680
and we're typically doing insect

1639
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,800
management

1640
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,880
now every time the code gets checked in

1641
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,079
it does a full

1642
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,240
code check it does that full stoner

1643
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
queue with that that static analysis

1644
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,040
and then we use a tenables a cast

1645
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,800
framework to do scans on the overall

1646
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,079
integration to making sure that it's

1647
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,400
compliant with stigs and cves

1648
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
at the far end and those scans come

1649
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,599
every time

1650
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,119
code is checked in and then built on a

1651
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,440
nightly basis and then we do those scans

1652
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,119
on a monthly basis to go back and check

1653
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,559
that what we're building

1654
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,319
actually matches or the the scans we're

1655
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,599
getting from the pipeline actually match

1656
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,200
the scans we've got to build

1657
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,400
so those are some of the kpis we use

1658
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:39,839
to move forward

1659
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,319
at the fair risk management i don't

1660
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,920
think i've seen the fair risk management

1661
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,880
framework

1662
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,079
um i will uh look it up

1663
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,240
and take a look if you want to get me

1664
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,760
email i'm happy to give you a response

1665
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,400
back

1666
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
i've seen a lot of stuff and a lot of

1667
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,480
risk management boils down to that same

1668
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,960
uh for me that that threat versus

1669
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,599
vulnerability versus exposure

1670
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,040
and there's a lot of things we can do

1671
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,960
along the way to get there and a lot of

1672
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,680
things we can

1673
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,598
look at to manage those individual risks

1674
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,440
but when we look at the risks

1675
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,880
we still have to manage them effectively

1676
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,200
we have to manage them effectively

1677
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,240
based on our organization

1678
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,400
uh as a devops ambassador i have to say

1679
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,280
it manages

1680
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,960
value right how do you deliver value for

1681
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,400
your organization how do you get

1682
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,680
security to a place

1683
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,400
where you deliver effective value in

1684
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,440
moving forward

1685
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,760
okay

1686
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,520
so how do we approach organization we're

1687
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,119
senior leaderships focused on delivering

1688
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,240
agile with no regard how their

1689
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,760
organization is currently structured for

1690
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,200
delivering software

1691
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,359
how do you approach these conversations

1692
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,800
uh well when the senior leadership is

1693
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,760
your boss obviously

1694
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,000
you approach them very carefully um

1695
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,800
and that has to be the key and i think

1696
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,319
it goes back to being the advocate

1697
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,160
and saying the same things over and over

1698
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,520
a part of that agile is that

1699
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,800
transparency

1700
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,160
and you need to be able to approach them

1701
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,839
and say hey look you know what this

1702
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:10,880
isn't working

1703
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,720
uh and when they're not willing to

1704
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,079
change

1705
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,480
then you kind of do the best you can

1706
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,520
sometimes

1707
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,559
uh or you offer different suggestions

1708
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,520
i've had a lot of good luck with

1709
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,720
boston's in the past

1710
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,240
but instead of saying hey we need to

1711
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,400
change this and we need a plan for you

1712
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,079
or i need an approach from you

1713
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,200
is to suggest um you know here's what i

1714
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,599
think

1715
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,280
here's how i think we should do it uh

1716
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,400
what do you think about that can you

1717
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,119
give you some

1718
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,000
some input on the changes and making

1719
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,480
process that way

1720
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,400
if you can't

1721
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,520
agile should not be as defined by

1722
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,839
the organization structure is by the

1723
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,599
cultural mindset

1724
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,599
if you're talking about how you hand off

1725
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,839
information from one to the other

1726
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,640
as was a process of reducing the number

1727
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,960
of handoffs that you have or the dev ops

1728
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,000
process of reducing the

1729
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,760
process that you have maybe

1730
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,480
one of the suggestions would be if you

1731
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:10,800
look

1732
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,359
at a the sre programs or site

1733
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,200
reliability engineer to streamline some

1734
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,640
of those things

1735
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,839
maybe implementing or

1736
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,839
enforcing a site reliability engineer

1737
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,839
could help you get the champion

1738
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,359
to make the changes where you needed to

1739
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,839
make the changes uh i talked to her at a

1740
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,599
speech last year at devsecops up in

1741
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,680
austin

1742
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,359
one of the individuals talked about

1743
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,440
having a batman having a batman on their

1744
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,040
sock team and every time the guy came in

1745
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,760
it was bad

1746
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,040
you called from the outside to get

1747
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,720
somebody you got back whoever was there

1748
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,640
for that week was batman right

1749
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,319
and it's the same type of thing with sre

1750
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,760
that you have an individual

1751
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,960
whose job is to make things flow better

1752
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,640
and that they do the restructuring they

1753
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,000
present the restructuring and they make

1754
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,520
sure that things flow through

1755
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,800
or they just take it and they walk it

1756
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,160
from place to place to make sure that

1757
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,359
things get done

1758
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,359
and the way they need to get done and i

1759
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,920
think as you increase the value

1760
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,440
you've gradually convinced the senior

1761
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,440
leadership that the agile thing is

1762
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,960
better

1763
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,880
and that you're increasing their value

1764
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,319
when they give you some space to do

1765
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,680
these type of things

1766
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,720
uh as i mentioned with government uh

1767
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,760
one of those challenges is um

1768
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,200
when they implement devops for the first

1769
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,400
time and i've been in the two different

1770
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,040
organizations

1771
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,960
i've seen it twice the first thing they

1772
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,240
really need to do is they need to say

1773
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:24,800
all right

1774
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,640
you're going to be agile we're going to

1775
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,160
do this thing and we're going to do this

1776
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,599
flow with devops

1777
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,800
but here's your first three months plan

1778
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,720
your sprints but i don't need anything

1779
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,280
delivered right i have no expectations

1780
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,359
other than that you build your teams you

1781
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,280
do the bottom up organization you figure

1782
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,559
out how your teams are going to work and

1783
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,800
figure out how the process is

1784
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,640
unfortunately a lot of organizations

1785
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,000
don't have time for that

1786
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,359
but it does speak to the effectiveness

1787
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,200
of creating your own dojo where you can

1788
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,559
focus on those things where you can

1789
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:53,920
bring the people out for a while or

1790
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,880
bring a team out

1791
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,640
and have them focus on a very specific

1792
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,319
thing which is training

1793
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,920
and learning how they should interact

1794
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,119
and learning how they need to interact

1795
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,359
with other folks

1796
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:10,319
um somebody tell afterwards we uh

1797
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,599
i don't think i have any more questions

1798
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,559
we'll move things over to the uh the

1799
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,640
other track

1800
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,839
we'll move it over to track two if

1801
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
somebody has any more questions for me

1802
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,480
i'll be happy to take them there

1803
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,920
i'll be hanging out thanks again to

1804
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,440
b-sides for giving the opportunity i

1805
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,960
really enjoyed the chance to speak

1806
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,040
uh hopefully you all enjoyed it as well

1807
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,960
um and i will return it to the uh

1808
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,800
the present so that he can have control

1809
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,079
and he can out the next person get set

1810
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,680
up for their presentation

1811
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,960
thank you very much i appreciate your

1812
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
time

1813
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,520
you
