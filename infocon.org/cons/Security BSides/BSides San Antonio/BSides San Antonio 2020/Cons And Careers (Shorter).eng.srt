1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,879
sciatic nerd well hi there everybody

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,560
good morning i'm

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,520
sciatic nerd your host through a quick

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,519
jaunt of cons and careers

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,280
thanks so much for being here this

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
morning first talk of the day sometimes

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,120
not the easiest time slot

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,920
but we're gonna do this thing so as i'm

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,119
sure everyone's aware there's the

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,000
ability to

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,240
answer or extremely ask questions down

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,359
in the box

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,880
for go to webinar and i hope that we can

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,599
learn something together today the first

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,119
thing we have to cover though

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,559
is how one of the problems or challenges

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,680
especially

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
in this industry is this thing that's

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
called imposter syndrome right

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,440
and impostor syndrome if you're not

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
familiar with it is that concern that

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,559
self-doubt

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,800
that nags or eats at you when you're

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
trying to accomplish something

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,879
you don't know if you're good enough or

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,239
if you have the

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,760
the wherewithal to get through whatever

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,520
the training or whatever needs to be to

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,079
get there

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,199
and that's something that we all

31
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,320
experience from time to time i believe

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,640
but let me start by explaining uh a tale

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,840
of growing up

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,519
so my brother i don't know how it worked

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,760
in in your household or family

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
but my brother is the one with the the

37
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,799
radio or stereo

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,320
when we were growing up and he's an

39
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
older brother and well he loved a band

40
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,159
called yes and it drove me

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
nuts because this one album of theirs

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,080
called 90125

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
was ridiculously popular in the early

44
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,520
80s yes

45
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,479
early 80s that's right so the weird

46
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,200
thing

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
about this is that i couldn't

48
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
get away from it he played this song

49
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,079
over and over again this really popular

50
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,640
song

51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,720
but it turned out that all this

52
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,159
frustration of my own

53
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,400
was kind of i don't know lost i wanted

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
something of my own and so i

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
learned about a band called the art of

56
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
noise right so it turns out that

57
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,399
i said well this is so different it's so

58
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,720
independently thought of it's not this

59
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,799
mass-produced feeling thing and i was

60
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,280
just wrong uh the reality is is that the

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,560
person who did the

62
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,200
programming the music programming on

63
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,360
90125 is the same person

64
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
who came up with the art of noise the

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
music programmer

66
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,440
was working with the drummer from yes

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,919
for

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,360
tracks 490125 when they got the idea to

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,160
start

70
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
their own band the point being

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
sometimes you need to more closely

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,599
examine the things that are around us

73
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,160
to realize it might just be the reason

74
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,599
the thing you love got started in the

75
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,319
first place

76
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,400
or our perspective could just be changed

77
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
right

78
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,599
which i think is not unlike following a

79
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,519
career because over the course of a

80
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,440
career you've gotta have time to

81
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,840
make mistakes and try to course correct

82
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
to get yourself back on track

83
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
and sometimes that even leads you to

84
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
trying to give back to the community

85
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
that helped you come up

86
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,680
or that you want to see grow and that's

87
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
a really strong draw for someone like me

88
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,000
because i want to help others find their

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
path

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
because there's no clear way through

91
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
this ridiculous jungle

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
it can be very confusing but how do we

93
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,760
add value

94
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,400
to ourselves in order to accomplish this

95
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,280
and that's where

96
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
conferences like this can be so

97
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,879
beneficial in my opinion

98
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,360
see the thing is we can't just exist in

99
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
a vacuum right we have to have a way to

100
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,200
get new ideas in there has to be a way

101
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,640
to move us forward

102
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,840
and at some point going and talking to

103
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,319
your

104
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,360
local user groups may not be enough but

105
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,879
then again

106
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
let's just see about what benefits we

107
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,599
can get out of these conferences right

108
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,000
you you have to realize that there are

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
lots of ways that you can grow one way

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,640
is maturity of course or at least the

111
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,159
willingness to admit when we're wrong or

112
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,040
need help

113
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,599
the other way is to get more interactive

114
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,120
and to see what other people are

115
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
thinking to not just rely on

116
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,599
ourselves and this is really about an

117
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,280
epic journey and that epic journey is

118
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,080
yours

119
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,760
okay and that's kind of how i like to

120
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,360
share things though is in the form of a

121
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,080
story

122
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
and i like the idea of story arcs right

123
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,760
so you've got the beginning middle and

124
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
end there is a challenge a build up

125
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,879
and then some kind of resolution whether

126
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,400
or not it's good or bad that

127
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,519
remains to be seen but this in all will

128
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,879
be explained through the

129
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,720
allegory of a story arc right so

130
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,320
i have to explain also right up front

131
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
some disclaimers you're gonna have to

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
leave the comfort of your herd

133
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
sometimes to do this and sometimes it's

134
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,960
also learned to break out of your shell

135
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,199
and learn how to talk to other folks

136
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,880
this is going to be key if this is

137
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,639
something that you want to engage in

138
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,880
that growth comes with exposure and

139
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
experience right

140
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,840
so in my theory everybody needs somebody

141
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,040
even people who don't like other people

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,880
they need someone to tell that to so

143
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,960
you're also going to run into people who

144
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,479
are better

145
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,960
doors than they are windows right and

146
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
gatekeeping is bad but that doesn't mean

147
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
that just because that roadblock is

148
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
there today

149
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
that it cannot be circumvented or

150
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,759
overcome tomorrow

151
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,880
the key is to not give up persistence

152
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,840
really pays so let's go over what we're

153
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
going to cover here

154
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
as best we can in the time we've got

155
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,039
which is we're gonna go through

156
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,800
a discussion of conferences and again

157
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
story arcs right so if you think about

158
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
kind of drinking from the fire hose

159
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,120
narrowing that stream so that you're not

160
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
drowning getting to a point where you

161
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
can actually start to share what you've

162
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,919
been learning and then

163
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,240
what happens if it's your turn at bat

164
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,039
what are you

165
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
going to contribute to the rest of the

166
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,759
community or enable others to share

167
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
along the way and during all of that you

168
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,479
have to watch out

169
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,160
for the risk of over extending yourself

170
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
which means it's possible to just burn

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
yourself out so

172
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,600
terribly that it's difficult to come

173
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
back

174
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
so there are lots of different kinds of

175
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,360
events that you'll hear about or read

176
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,639
about now i don't know how many other

177
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,759
events you go to

178
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,160
and i'm very thankful you're here to see

179
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,800
this

180
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,039
at b-side san antonio but there are

181
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,000
local national

182
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
regional and special interest type of

183
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,280
events that

184
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
sometimes are irreplaceable right it's

185
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,199
great to know that there are local

186
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,680
meetups but that doesn't necessarily

187
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,919
provide all the detail that might be out

188
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,960
there so

189
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
if you're starting at home right don't

190
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
you don't have to break the bank and

191
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
especially in a time like we're in now

192
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,199
virtual conferences are terrific way to

193
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
get outside of your shell

194
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
and at extremely low risk and usually

195
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
relatively low cost

196
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,759
but the idea would be if it's possible

197
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
go to your local meetups go and do a

198
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,000
search

199
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,639
on on meetup for your particular

200
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,280
interest

201
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
and if you're not sure what that is

202
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
we'll get to that in a second but there

203
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,319
are so many different ways and

204
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,360
opportunities

205
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,120
and if you have the opportunity and

206
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
things clear up

207
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,560
will definitely engage in travel if

208
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
there's a way to do so

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
i've heard stories of people who wanted

210
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,919
to go to defcon or other

211
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
non-local events partner together

212
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
share rooms split the cost uh use an

213
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,880
inexpensive airbnb

214
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,479
call that relative that you haven't

215
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,080
spoken to that often to see if their

216
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,199
couch is available

217
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
i've heard all kinds of stories over the

218
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
time i've done a few myself and

219
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,599
i have to tell you but i was a younger

220
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
person and slept on the floor of a crash

221
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,479
room

222
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,440
crash room at a con i really don't

223
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,080
relish

224
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,919
repeating that process because getting

225
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,960
stepped on at three in the morning

226
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
wasn't my favorite

227
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,080
but everyone's going to have their own

228
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,960
experiences and your mileage may vary

229
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,240
and sometimes there's just no replacing

230
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,039
a specific type of experience right so

231
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,639
there will be moments where you go to

232
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,080
something like a recon reverse

233
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,360
engineering conference

234
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
or maybe the ise squared

235
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
congress event itself there are so many

236
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,759
tailored experiences that may be on hold

237
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,560
right now

238
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,120
but a lot of their videos are online but

239
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,960
it seems like online

240
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,039
after the fact some of the energy can be

241
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,319
lost because there isn't that

242
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
connectivity between the people

243
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,720
but that's okay it depends on how each

244
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,319
person learns right

245
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
so whether you're willing to go and do

246
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,479
something over the weekend

247
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
or your your company or ongoing concern

248
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,440
is willing to support your conference

249
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,080
habit

250
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
there is a huge breadth of places

251
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
to engage in if you haven't taken the

252
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,879
time go look up the

253
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,280
north american conference schedule or go

254
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,879
look some of the sites for the top 10

255
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
best conferences things like that

256
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,440
but don't miss out on looking up the

257
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,400
regional events

258
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,560
which may be going on near you or at

259
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
least have an online presence that you

260
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
can participate in

261
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,279
so that it is possible to continue your

262
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
own growth

263
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,080
and if you don't like just going to

264
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,399
presentations oh my gosh there are some

265
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,080
amazing capture the flag events there

266
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
are three going on today

267
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,760
there are things that will help take you

268
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
from the very beginning experience

269
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,760
all the way up to seasoned professionals

270
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
only who are going to make headway in

271
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,160
this thing

272
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
and whether or not you come out on top

273
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
it's worth doing it just for the

274
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
experience get started

275
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
maybe you're not super amazing winner of

276
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,000
all ctfs

277
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
so what you still get a chance to learn

278
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
something you still

279
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
have an opportunity to grow and maybe

280
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,399
even learn from others who are

281
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,519
participating

282
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
depending on how you're able to interact

283
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,760
there are activities of all kinds at

284
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,800
these events

285
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
whether it's lock picking 101 or today

286
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,160
we have

287
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,480
phil wiley in the pwn school doing a

288
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
piece on how to get started with

289
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,279
learning penetration testing tools or

290
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,720
over in another room we've got the

291
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,240
wireless breaker space

292
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
or just go participate in the crypto

293
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
challenges there are

294
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
always opportunities to learn at a

295
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,880
conference

296
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,560
if you're able to break out of your

297
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,360
space and go and engage

298
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
like i said at the beginning it's

299
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
difficult but worth it

300
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
so where to begin career level one

301
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,640
you're fighting the chickens out in the

302
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
yard if you play rpg games

303
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,399
this is your support job never

304
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,480
underestimate the importance of that

305
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,040
thing

306
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,360
and you know it's weird this is kind of

307
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
like a real

308
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
open tavern scene the

309
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
really uh cliche tavern scene from the

310
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
beginning of a lot of

311
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
period pieces or adventure stories

312
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
because you don't know where everything

313
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,600
is

314
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
and it's important to take time to learn

315
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
the ropes so at career level one

316
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
the support job you should in my opinion

317
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,480
leverage social media now it's not to

318
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,279
share every time you got up for coffee

319
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,519
necessarily but it's a great way to

320
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,040
learn the players in the public

321
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
landscape it's a good way

322
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,360
to see what's going on it is literally a

323
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,839
raging river of information let's take

324
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,399
twitter

325
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,600
for example and go ahead and do a search

326
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,480
on twitter

327
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
for your information you know obviously

328
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,560
hashtags are a huge thing right so

329
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,399
search for information security or dare

330
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,839
i say it the c word

331
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,720
and you'll find tons of information but

332
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
you're not sure what to do with it if

333
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,519
you're just starting out maybe

334
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
that's why you start out always in my

335
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
mind drinking from the fire hose

336
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,959
and there are lots of different avenues

337
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,279
to explore each of them have their own

338
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
pitfalls and challenges

339
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,200
but the point is this is where you can

340
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
start to engage with others to ask

341
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,839
what's going on

342
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,680
try to get a read of the land and really

343
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,440
identify what the up and coming

344
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,959
challenges are

345
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,600
so beyond that what should you be able

346
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
to take away from

347
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
throwing yourself into a conference or a

348
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
local meetup

349
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
well so this is just uh if you ever saw

350
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,279
a galaxy quest you're just happy to be

351
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
on the show man

352
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
this is the opportunity to say hi i'm

353
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,600
here

354
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,920
it's your introduction ta-da i'm on the

355
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,360
scene chapter one

356
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
and what are you going to do with that

357
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,200
even if it's not a presentation that

358
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
truly sparked your interest

359
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
maybe you could talk to the presenter

360
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,640
afterwards ask a couple of questions

361
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
see what other opportunities there are

362
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,079
or learn about how something got done

363
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,480
in my very first break at a conference

364
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
which was b-sides las vegas back in 2011

365
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,959
i got an opportunity to sit and record

366
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,680
av

367
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,360
in a track i would not have chosen for

368
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
myself but they needed the help and i

369
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,079
offered

370
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,480
well they were gracious enough to accept

371
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,320
and allow me to do this in this one

372
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,440
track all day

373
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,040
and i've got to tell you i wouldn't have

374
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
chosen half of those presentations to

375
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,079
sit through that wasn't

376
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,880
what i was looking for however since it

377
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,079
was my role

378
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
i picked up all kinds of tidbits because

379
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
i stayed awake and watched

380
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,880
to make sure the recordings looked good

381
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
but also

382
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,399
i picked up things i would never have

383
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,399
even imagined to think about

384
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,800
from those presenters and that opened

385
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,120
other doors and opened where at the end

386
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
of the presentation right before they

387
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,120
left

388
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,399
i stopped him and asked a couple of

389
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,279
questions but this is part of a pattern

390
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,760
that

391
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
kind of comes up over and over again

392
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,880
that

393
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,519
it all provides value back and what does

394
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,720
that do for your career

395
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,399
all of these things break down across

396
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,320
several areas for your team

397
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,959
your co-workers your management and to

398
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,120
you personally but of course your

399
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,839
mileage

400
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,639
will vary right so from a career

401
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,000
perspective it gives you exposure

402
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,839
to who's out there you get a chance to

403
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,440
learn who's there it shows your

404
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
leadership that you're actually trying

405
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
you're not just staying in your box

406
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,880
but you're taking steps to move outward

407
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
right it helps bridge the ever-present

408
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,279
gap

409
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,480
between companies and community because

410
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
it exists in a weird space and you never

411
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,639
know when you may need to

412
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,160
leverage or say hi to one of those

413
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,839
contacts you've made over the time

414
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,399
to ask for a little help so it's always

415
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,160
good to be as open and friendly as

416
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
possible if if that's an option

417
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,040
but to management at work they're

418
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,160
looking to see

419
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,320
initiative right they want to know that

420
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
you're willing to step up and step out

421
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,040
of your box

422
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
maybe even volunteer for a project you

423
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,519
wouldn't normally even consider

424
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
doing and why because it demonstrates to

425
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,279
them that you're willing to make an

426
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:37,839
effort

427
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,000
and always keep your ears up your excuse

428
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,920
me and always keep your ears open

429
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
for the opportunity that you may not be

430
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,120
aware of or

431
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,199
some specific training opportunities

432
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,320
that can crop up

433
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,399
because those things can come in very

434
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,600
handy down the road

435
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,959
and your team will suddenly see that

436
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,800
you're like trying to figure out how to

437
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,240
do things around the place you're not

438
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,720
just

439
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
there in the corner with your blinders

440
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
up doing only your work and not talking

441
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,000
to anyone

442
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
and of course the hardest thing in the

443
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,320
world be willing to ask for help

444
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
sometimes very difficult to utter the

445
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,920
words i was wrong i need help i made a

446
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,959
mistake

447
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,760
did that go out in production live

448
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,199
anyway the value to you

449
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,920
is an offer to help with if you were to

450
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,360
take it on yourself to offer

451
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
to help with work you wouldn't normally

452
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
do

453
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
this can again demonstrate to your

454
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
teammates you are willing to break

455
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,199
outside of your box

456
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,560
and if nothing else you're trying to

457
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,480
build rapport you're trying to make a

458
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
connection with people

459
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,160
and intelligence alone won't save you

460
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,760
being the smartest person

461
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
in the room doesn't necessarily resolve

462
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,279
issues

463
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,040
and what if it turns out that there are

464
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,160
unseen and unintended consequences

465
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,240
you're great that's a terrific story

466
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
you're sharing there friend

467
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
um i don't know what you think you're

468
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,959
doing because you don't know me but

469
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,720
i'm really concerned you don't know my

470
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,880
situation and because of that none of

471
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,399
this really applies to me but yeah of

472
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,519
course

473
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,279
imposter syndrome is that invisible

474
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
level boss that's pressing down on you

475
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,000
all the time and this is something that

476
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,040
has to be overcome

477
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,600
in order to proceed to level two which

478
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,199
is what i'm i like to think of as

479
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,639
specialization at least it works that

480
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,600
way for me

481
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
i went from this wide ridiculous fire

482
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
hose like i don't know what i want to go

483
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,040
and learn

484
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
to narrowing it down a little bit and

485
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,240
that's what the level two is about

486
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,839
it's about his time going on and we

487
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,199
start to realize what it is that we're

488
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:25,839
doing

489
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,680
maybe at those events we've started

490
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
identifying

491
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
the things we really want to pay

492
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,639
attention to and you start to zero in on

493
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,759
specific talks

494
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,680
it's a natural progression but this is

495
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,839
where traveling can start to help if you

496
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
go to other cons outside your area

497
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,440
because eventually you might run out of

498
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,519
what everybody says nearby

499
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,360
so it's important to go and learn what

500
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
other folks are doing

501
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
and at some of the larger events there's

502
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,839
a difference

503
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,920
cross-section of attendees you might get

504
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,759
people who are coming from further away

505
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,560
which is another opportunity to listen

506
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,279
and learn

507
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,040
from those folks share some of your

508
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,800
ideas but definitely

509
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,519
get some new input and while this might

510
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,920
not take place during a talk it may be

511
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,320
at the hotel restaurant or maybe at a

512
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,040
get-together

513
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,199
outside afterwards you never know where

514
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,959
you might run into some folks who

515
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,320
are similar to what you're doing you

516
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,079
have to keep your eyes on social media

517
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,160
there may even be an impromptu meetup

518
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
that's worthwhile exploring

519
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,320
but when you go sometimes it's not

520
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,079
always great to go by yourself

521
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,320
especially if you're new to a space i

522
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,920
find i like going with a conference

523
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,120
buddy

524
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,720
whoever your buddy is that's your call

525
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
but i do highly encourage and recommend

526
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,360
it

527
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,519
it's very important because going on

528
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,959
your own is difficult but

529
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,279
now what are you bringing back so you're

530
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,120
bringing new ideas back with you that

531
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,680
you can

532
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,399
share to your team it may result in the

533
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
opportunity to write or contribute to a

534
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,199
white paper

535
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,240
which again shows to your co-workers

536
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,639
that you're really making an effort that

537
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
you are trying to grow outside of your

538
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,440
own box

539
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,120
and this may actually win in another way

540
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,600
because

541
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
now this information is being made

542
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,639
available perhaps

543
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
months before the videos get published

544
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,679
and it shows

545
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,039
and demonstrates your willingness to

546
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,039
share that information and this helps

547
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,359
you

548
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,520
because now you're staying connected and

549
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,039
you should stay connected

550
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,799
to the people you've met using social

551
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,720
media or you met him in person

552
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,039
at the conference stay connected by

553
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,919
social media

554
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,439
just to see what folks are up to and

555
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,599
keep keep

556
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,839
in touch because you've got to have some

557
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,359
time to grow it's not going to happen

558
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,760
instantly and that's the thing is it

559
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
doesn't always come quickly and may not

560
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,240
be

561
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
on a timetable that makes sense for you

562
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
so each story arc

563
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
that's being described here may take

564
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,840
different times for different people

565
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
one of my story arcs from the beginning

566
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
just moving into arc two

567
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,640
took probably oh two to three years but

568
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,000
everybody's different and you're like

569
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,799
great

570
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,280
that's hilarious doesn't apply to me i

571
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,919
get it

572
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,000
i don't know you i don't know your

573
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,440
situation i don't

574
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
this applies to each person differently

575
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,120
but that's why

576
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,520
as we get nervous or afraid or we don't

577
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,400
know how or we

578
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
fail at something that's okay this is

579
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
the level boss to overcome

580
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,440
and it's not necessarily going to happen

581
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
quickly but if you do

582
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
you can get to the prestige class arc 3

583
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,039
where you get to share

584
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,400
what you've been learning if you spent

585
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,480
all your time narrowing that focus

586
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
and learning about butter sculpture or

587
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
whatever it is that you followed

588
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,320
maybe at a certain point you realize

589
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
salted butter is not the way kids

590
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,640
you need to switch from unsalted to

591
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,360
salted

592
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,679
whatever the case now you can start

593
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,960
writing those presentations and

594
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,760
submitting them

595
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,679
because more time has passed people are

596
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,520
now maybe even coming to you for the

597
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,039
answers they're looking for

598
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,720
and if you might become the subject

599
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
matter expert

600
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,480
okay maybe the stuckey who knows the

601
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,280
point is is that

602
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
you may even start to get curious about

603
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,799
certifications if you haven't had to

604
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,600
already

605
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,039
and they have their place there's a

606
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,880
larger conversation there

607
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,320
but i gotta say that recruiters and

608
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,600
uh those in hr teams generally leverage

609
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
that if you're trying to get a start

610
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,400
so it may help your situation down the

611
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
road may be a different story

612
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,440
the point is that's a separate

613
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,120
conversation outside of the scope of

614
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,440
this

615
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,480
talk what i'm trying to share is when it

616
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
comes time to do public speaking

617
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,919
it may help to think of things kind of

618
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,200
as a progression right so you're kind of

619
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,360
learn from other presenters around the

620
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
world stand up comics actors

621
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,520
go to local if you haven't looked it up

622
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,760
toastmasters in your area oh my gosh

623
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
super important take a look at

624
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
toastmasters it's a whole organization

625
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,760
that is

626
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,080
just focused on how to present to people

627
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,840
and they have meetups all the time and

628
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,880
everybody

629
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
gets a chance to present and learn this

630
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,080
is a very

631
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,919
fearful thing other ways to help

632
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
yourself to get better at it grab that

633
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,760
hair brush look in the mirror

634
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,559
set up a timer and go you're really into

635
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,200
it

636
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,679
set yourself a webcam or a camera record

637
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,320
it and

638
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,640
dare i say watch yourself because you

639
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,520
have to see

640
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,600
where if you're doing the podium dance

641
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
or if you happen to have a

642
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,840
facial tic or something whatever it is

643
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,679
work on it we all have to

644
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,360
and what about demos do you want to

645
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,799
leave that chance no

646
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
you want to prepare as best you can and

647
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,919
get things

648
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,679
rolling and how do you get things

649
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,200
prepared you record a video

650
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
but you got to get that stuff ready and

651
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
you've got to submit which means you're

652
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
opening yourself up for rejection

653
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,840
but that's okay too getting rejected is

654
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
just part of this process

655
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
and it's gonna happen a lot and that's

656
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,960
okay

657
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,039
sometimes the voice is wrong sometimes

658
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
the blurb you submit is incorrect

659
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,640
you've got to submit an outline in a lot

660
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,720
of cases don't worry about that

661
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
it's part of the process and you'll get

662
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,640
better as you do it more often

663
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,320
at least that's been my experience so

664
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,559
far the ability to present well

665
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,679
is also highly valued at work and it can

666
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,120
help make your boss look good

667
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,360
just don't outshine your boss if you can

668
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,400
help it

669
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
now with all their value is represent

670
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,159
well

671
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,240
and show that initiative and keep moving

672
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,320
forward and in value to yourself

673
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
learning to speak in public does wonders

674
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,679
for self confidence

675
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,240
at least it did for me so far because i

676
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,159
gotta tell you it's not easy oh and this

677
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,200
is also very helpful

678
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,039
when it comes time to do job interviews

679
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,799
because you've already got the ideas

680
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,440
and process in your head to be working

681
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,320
on it now

682
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,600
i know we're short on time so i'm going

683
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,679
to jump ahead here

684
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,120
by going into this third arc and

685
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,960
presenting you are in a group of people

686
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,400
that is different than before you are

687
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,840
now in the group that presents

688
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
and you have a new opportunity to

689
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,280
interact with other people and learn

690
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,240
from them

691
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,720
and this is a huge step at least it has

692
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,919
been so far

693
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
and you know it's nerve-wracking but i

694
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,760
don't really know

695
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,320
your situation but i do know that it's

696
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,919
helped me get where i am in my career

697
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,720
today

698
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,039
and that is one of my level bosses that

699
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,240
i've had to fight

700
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
so hustling through here now what if it

701
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,760
was your term as gm

702
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
maybe now you're looking to build

703
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,799
something so other people can have an

704
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,799
opportunity to learn and share and grow

705
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,080
well what does this really do to you

706
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,640
well it can open some other bigger doors

707
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,240
at work because people pay attention to

708
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,679
you differently or maybe they ask

709
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
things of you you normally wouldn't but

710
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,799
that's okay

711
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,880
you can actually start to build your own

712
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,679
coordination skills and don't worry

713
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,960
too much ask for help a lot it's scary

714
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
it really is but that's what led to

715
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
b-side san antonio

716
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,200
2020 is people came alongside and have

717
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
helped and there's a wonderful team here

718
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,559
i am thankful for those people who have

719
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,679
been willing to come out and help and

720
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,039
they're all new challenges

721
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
i never knew how much table coverings

722
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,559
could cost and other things

723
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,400
it's a ridiculous learning experience

724
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
but it's worth it and you're going to

725
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,559
need help

726
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,000
marketing things getting through

727
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
conflict resolution team building

728
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,480
and the volunteer army i really

729
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,159
appreciate them because it's what helps

730
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,679
make this event possible

731
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,520
and while you might think to yourself my

732
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,320
gosh that that's ridiculous i thank you

733
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,400
for sharing but that doesn't apply to me

734
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,679
you don't know what i'm going through

735
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,600
right now no i don't

736
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,679
but i know that we all face the beast of

737
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,200
confusion and

738
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,919
fear and we must all overcome something

739
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,520
it one step at a time

740
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,679
take it one bite at a time because it is

741
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
so worth it and as you do that

742
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
watch out for this thing the beast of

743
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,400
burnout there is a ridiculous

744
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
pressure from all sides at all times to

745
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
perform deliver and do

746
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
take moments to back off check yourself

747
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,799
take a deep breath because you have to

748
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,200
go back sometimes and reinvigorate

749
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,960
or revive revitalize those things are so

750
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
important and key so that you can find

751
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,799
out what it was that excited you in the

752
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,840
first place

753
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,640
because if it's possible go back and

754
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,159
look about what excited you about your

755
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,400
topic to begin with whatever it is

756
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
sometimes you might not even realize

757
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,240
that going back to the very beginning

758
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,159
may reveal something completely new

759
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
just like the band i loved the art of

760
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,159
noise i had no idea they were connected

761
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,240
to the band my brother loved

762
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
but it was only in my thoughtful

763
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,559
revisiting of the band

764
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,400
and reading an article about the way

765
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
they were kind of thing

766
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,919
that opened my eyes to that so new

767
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,200
directions can come out of that

768
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,080
reflection

769
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,880
and it takes time so don't think it's

770
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,240
going gonna happen right away

771
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
but it's worth it and if you can find

772
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
someone to partner with a mentor

773
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
a friend a sounding board because honest

774
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,600
feedback

775
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,400
is huge and makes things so so much

776
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,279
better

777
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,919
all right so i know it's easy for me to

778
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,840
say sitting from where i am now but

779
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,320
if the kid who hid in the av room in the

780
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,279
seventh grade

781
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,520
can be up here now doing this i'm

782
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,760
telling you it's possible for you too

783
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,960
you just have to break out

784
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
and give it that time space and

785
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,640
opportunity to grow

786
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
and it's a cool story and you don't know

787
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
me well

788
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,559
it's not easy to say but i know that we

789
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,400
can build a community together

790
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,200
let's please help each other grow and

791
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,279
learn better

792
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,400
thank you i will be over

793
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
in in the interest of time because we're

794
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,159
so close i'm going to be over in the

795
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,880
track

796
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,039
one breakout if you have any questions

797
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,559
or anything else thank you so much for

798
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,240
your time and attention i'm going to

799
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:15,840
turn it back

800
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,199
you
