1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,860
I thought I had tested it I thought I

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,480
had my metric correct but apparently I

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,200
did

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,899
uh Dr strategic Security in my spare

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,420
time I do Judo I write I speak uh

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,280
sometimes in that order and I have two

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,200
dogs which are Great Danes which take up

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,940
a lot of the time especially with the

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,859
heat and they like swimming in the pool

10
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,000
so we're gonna talk about the basics

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,960
we're going to talk about Advanced

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
metrics and accelerating that

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
advancement for you I say one completely

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,859
100 not not safe there's no virus it's

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,939
your malware if you're getting this on

16
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,920
distributed version however just knowing

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,430
the metrics

18
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,599
[Music]

19
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,820
so focused uh this is how you can get

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,100
you there also if you've made a devops

21
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,940
transition

22
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,380
I said 12 months it's probably not for

23
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,480
you and the reason we caveat that is

24
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,100
because it takes some time to get into

25
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,200
those Baseline metrics it takes some

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,059
time to understand what you're doing and

27
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,440
after think about it and make the

28
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,120
advanced changes starting with those

29
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,620
Basics is going to get you that that

30
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,120
first take and once you've got those

31
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
bases you start knowing where they don't

32
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
do the job for you where they don't get

33
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,399
you where you need to be in order to get

34
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,840
further you really need to think through

35
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,219
that process and think through that

36
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,600
understanding you have of what you're

37
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,739
doing why you're doing

38
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,380
so metrics logs and traces are great and

39
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,820
you will get them automatically from any

40
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,619
number of installed programs apis

41
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,299
however we're not going to fix your

42
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,500
problems they're going to tell you where

43
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,479
our problems is if you understand it

44
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,580
enough of the metrics to get there so

45
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,200
just looking at those numbers looking at

46
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,180
those processes uh like we talked about

47
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,380
some of the other talks getting your

48
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,640
vulnerability checks knowing that

49
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,340
there's 79 vulnerabilities is great and

50
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,600
some people put that out there as a

51
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
metric but it's that metric over time

52
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
right looking at how that changes and

53
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
how that either decreases or increases

54
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,579
over time and then beyond that when you

55
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,960
talk about Advanced with vulnerability

56
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,060
looking at what those categories are if

57
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,320
they're all critical vulnerabilities

58
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,299
you've got to fix it right now if

59
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,920
they're lower vulnerabilities you can

60
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,259
wait uh I've seen some DOD programs

61
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,280
right when they were wrong with me they

62
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,420
said hey we're going to release every

63
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,740
three months which is not a great

64
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,140
timeline uh but they said well our cap

65
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,000
one vulnerabilities need to be fixed in

66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,579
48 hours so I'll address all the capital

67
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,560
with cat 2 vulnerabilities we have 30

68
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,180
days and with the cap three

69
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,380
vulnerabilities they're down at the

70
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,000
bottom we've got six months so you know

71
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,020
what we're never going to fix that

72
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,280
because we're going to release every

73
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,360
three months and we're just going to

74
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,699
take this accepted risk of things off uh

75
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,919
so is it good maybe not but at least

76
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,140
it's a metric for them moving forward

77
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,120
uh so advancing your devsecops practice

78
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,340
is fine-tunes your ability uh to create

79
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,680
those Solutions but it's not the metrics

80
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,879
it takes the problem it's the humans

81
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,140
that fix the problems because you have

82
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,819
to have something to talk about and you

83
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,680
have to have a ready number and a steady

84
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,660
number to be able to talk and quantify

85
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,160
what the problem is when you go into

86
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,660
management or when you go in and take

87
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,120
that uh that diagram cat mentioned with

88
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,500
you know paragraphs and paragraphs and

89
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,120
paragraphs and you need to be able to

90
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,840
simplify that to an easy answer

91
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,379
so starting some of the basics uh why do

92
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,120
you use metrics right right why is it

93
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,739
important we'll use a little bit of 5y

94
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,599
structure trying to ground and talk

95
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,819
around some of the discussions well our

96
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,440
metrics give us a quantifiable and

97
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,660
repeatable source of observability

98
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,519
we don't just have the observability but

99
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,599
we can move forward with that

100
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,400
observability to measuring multiple

101
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,080
processes and create things to drive

102
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,060
actions because ultimately that's what

103
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,440
you want from the method so you want to

104
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,120
drive an action you want to create some

105
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,040
type of number or some type of analysis

106
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,260
that helps you get to the next step that

107
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,780
helps you get to the idea you have to

108
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,099
move forward

109
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,040
so if I say why and I do my next lie I

110
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,599
said well why do I need a quantifiable

111
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,519
number why is it important for me to

112
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,379
gather the situation to Spanish so I can

113
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,480
move forward well people make a lot of

114
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,040
decisions they sentence there's somebody

115
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,540
say well I think we're doing good I

116
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,360
think we're doing bad I feel like we're

117
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,760
delivering often asked but they don't

118
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,860
actually have a qualification

119
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,780
so they've done some studies and a lot

120
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,319
of these other directions

121
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,400
uh so there's a book out there called

122
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,620
Noise by a convinciboney and sunstein

123
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,299
they did a lot of analysis of things

124
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,580
that affect your analysis they found

125
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,760
that 77 were randomly generated linear

126
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,560
model something that makes decisions

127
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,560
based on a random generally linear are

128
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,239
better than the human making decisions

129
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,860
against the same data

130
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,080
so any model is better than somebody

131
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,480
coming in making decision out of

132
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,099
it right so that says well if I have it

133
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,780
quantifiable at least I can have some

134
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,640
type of linear model applied which is

135
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,739
going to help me make a better decision

136
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,019
so why don't people understand the

137
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:13,860
numbers

138
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,840
well people tend to overestimate their

139
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
own ability to make good judgments based

140
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,858
on that right most people think they can

141
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,720
make good predictions if you ask them

142
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,000
they'll say oh yeah that's absolutely

143
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
the way we're going so while you're

144
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
confident in that yes I'm not I'm

145
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
confident in my abilities I'm confident

146
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,660
that the next threat is coming from here

147
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,100
we're going to deliver at this rate the

148
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,419
product is going to be done at this time

149
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,699
but they don't get the right answer

150
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,680
in this book called The Wisdom of crowds

151
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
by Sir Ricky found that large groups

152
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,740
getting better pants but only when

153
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,180
they're selected to that random group

154
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,220
right when they're assessing the weight

155
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,440
of a cow in a state fair and you're

156
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,060
looking at the cow and see how much cow

157
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,280
people put in their guesses they put in

158
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
wildly different guesses based on their

159
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,360
own experience what they think ways well

160
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,400
the average guess turns out to be about

161
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,440
10 percent of the right number right it

162
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,880
gets very very close when you take that

163
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,820
average so that average is good but the

164
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,900
people have still made the wrong

165
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,180
decisions on that individual basis so we

166
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,500
need to get something that takes in that

167
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,479
Aggregate and builds it back out for us

168
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,880
to move forward because we don't get the

169
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,340
right answers and actually as a side

170
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,020
note to this one when people get the

171
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,820
opportunity to talk to each other and

172
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,020
they have to put in one guest together

173
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,020
they're still wildly wrong so it's not

174
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,759
the group information it's the aggregate

175
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,900
of that group information because

176
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,400
numbers

177
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,900
so how do numbers improve my options

178
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,639
well numbers provide that repeatable

179
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,740
comparison to linear judgments they give

180
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,240
you that measure over time that you can

181
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,180
show and you're improving or you're uh

182
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,280
failing to hit the target you want by

183
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,300
understanding the metric and

184
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,440
understanding where to go forward from

185
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,120
there a great book for this one is

186
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,160
measure What Matters by John Norm he

187
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
talks about key performance indicators

188
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,300
how to set those uh more importantly he

189
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,639
says for reference to metrics that you

190
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,380
don't always need to succeed you want to

191
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,580
have some things that you're not going

192
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,440
to succeed at so you can Target those

193
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,940
for improvement right you can Target

194
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,800
where you need to make those changes and

195
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,180
where you need to take those actions to

196
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,500
drive forward

197
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,840
and then finally why do I need to guide

198
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,340
my access well if we go back to Agile

199
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,800
and devops uh we was actually this one

200
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,419
accelerated delivery and if we don't

201
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,919
know what's going on we can't accelerate

202
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,660
we just continue making the same process

203
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,639
in the same thing over and over again

204
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,280
and get to those same answers and that's

205
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,600
not what we want we want to have that

206
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,759
continuous Improvement right that uh

207
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,759
flow and the feedback in the continuous

208
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,440
learning

209
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,419
so how do you know what you know if

210
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,100
you're looking at metrics I've decided

211
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,680
that I need some veterans

212
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,419
uh this is a model I use a lot

213
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,979
intelligence I find it still applies

214
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,740
here it's a basic model critical thing

215
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,360
right thinking through a problem

216
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,479
the first question is how do you know

217
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,380
somebody's given you a number and they

218
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,060
said hey this is what we're doing

219
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,819
you say okay well how do you know

220
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,979
and then in an actual discussion they

221
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,539
said well we took all the numbers off

222
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,580
the system and we got the user rates and

223
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,319
we got the percentages the downloads and

224
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,180
then we added that in and then we wanted

225
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,160
it to be in this format from one to five

226
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,220
so being multiplied it by this random

227
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,419
number that would be concerned at the

228
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,919
algorithms

229
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,220
school okay what is the random number

230
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,840
actually doing so well it's converted

231
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,900
into the range you want wow that's kind

232
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,759
of good but you should know that in the

233
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,960
map what kind of manipulations you're

234
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,460
making and how that affects the

235
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,780
correlation of those numbers as you go

236
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,419
forward so so after you know how to know

237
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,860
I know I'm getting some Persona I know

238
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm getting rid of it for me Prometheus

239
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,360
I know I'm getting into my head is that

240
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,080
they're bringing me the right

241
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,780
information uh what should happen next

242
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,060
if I get that number should I see him go

243
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,860
up should I see it go down should I say

244
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,720
continue on that straight level what do

245
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,280
I expect to have happen once I get that

246
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,599
initial number

247
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,539
and then once you have that and you're

248
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,520
kind of sure to move forward the next is

249
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,319
well what also has to happen to make

250
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,400
that true

251
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,199
in the case of my Edge scanners I have

252
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,639
to make sure they're working correctly I

253
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,840
have to make sure they're connected back

254
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,340
to my central service right and they're

255
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,660
communicating the information correctly

256
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,340
I have to make sure that I'm getting in

257
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,900
the time of manner so that I don't have

258
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,240
one ad scan to support it every 24 hours

259
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,520
on this report again for 15 minutes and

260
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,720
then I'm getting a wildly different

261
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,180
variation of that information

262
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,120
so do that in following that through the

263
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,740
conclusions I have and the assumptions

264
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,720
I've made about what should happen

265
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,000
follow what I said I had for my premises

266
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,240
do they follow that path

267
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,919
and then I look at it again from my own

268
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,020
perspective taking a look and say

269
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,940
are there any other arguments I need for

270
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,860
those preferences to be true is there

271
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,539
anything else that has to happen that I

272
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,680
haven't thought about

273
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,580
that maybe sitex

274
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,279
the reset on a regular basis so I have

275
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,599
to account for their reset how their

276
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,679
reset is going to change my numbers

277
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,059
because they're going to drop off line

278
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,919
so now I'm only getting information from

279
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,740
site Y and Z but uh Y and Z don't get

280
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,420
too much business as I accidentally side

281
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,980
x is your primary customer

282
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,660
so I have to know how those go forward

283
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,339
and then finally I want to compare

284
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,839
apples to apples and not oranges to

285
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,710
elephants

286
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,980
[Music]

287
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,260
they both have a name so that makes them

288
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,440
relatively comparable right well now can

289
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,760
we look a little bit but they're not

290
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,380
quite the same thing at all okay so we

291
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,060
said well but they are because you know

292
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,160
what they're both juicy on the inside

293
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,279
like all right we're stretching it but

294
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,440
they're not comparable and you see this

295
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,940
when people try to take a number they

296
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,980
try to compare experience you see it

297
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,600
when kanban teams try to repair it

298
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,399
they're out to put the strong teams and

299
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,779
they're not measuring the same rates

300
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,940
they're not measuring the same details

301
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,800
uh one of the stories I had back from

302
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,940
intelligence that really illustrates

303
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,740
this example is they were measuring

304
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,779
power rates in uh in Baghdad During the

305
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,279
Reconstruction when they were doing

306
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,660
operational active treatment they were

307
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,060
trying to build Baghdad back up and they

308
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,320
wanted to make sure that they had power

309
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,000
for all the citizens well they were

310
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,860
measuring it by the average megawatts

311
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,959
supplied course of the day and they said

312
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,580
you know what we're supplying 15

313
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,339
megawatts of power on average every hour

314
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,620
every day that's great we can keep

315
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,300
everything at the time I said well

316
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,220
that's great but then why are people so

317
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,700
unhappy

318
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,420
so they were taking a high production in

319
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,160
hours averaging against low production

320
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,839
but where the low production was

321
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,160
happening or they weren't getting enough

322
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,080
power or they were getting brownouts was

323
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,339
between about 10 o'clock in the morning

324
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,260
and four o'clock in the afternoon when

325
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,480
it was really hot outside and all the

326
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,680
air conditioning was shutting off which

327
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
meant instead of staying in the house

328
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,680
has been packing people were going

329
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
outside talking to each other and

330
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,080
talking about how frustrating they were

331
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,360
which was not what they wanted at all so

332
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,500
you can see where the metric wasn't

333
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,839
comparing the right Apples to Apples

334
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,459
because the amount of power they had

335
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,959
didn't actually apply

336
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,820
uh and finally as a note for this when

337
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,560
you're looking at dashboards do not

338
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,060
equal awareness they create an

339
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,220
observability but your dashboard should

340
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,500
be a start for your discussion it should

341
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,120
be a track of those metrics track those

342
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,920
items that you can then look at and

343
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,959
drive further

344
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,579
so if you're looking at this you need to

345
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,660
start where you are you need to

346
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,160
recognize where your organization your

347
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,980
team your company is and figure out how

348
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,899
the metrics apply you what you need to

349
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,820
do to move forward uh and what your

350
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,660
process

351
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,760
do the initial surveys do the assessment

352
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,920
talk to people find out both what you're

353
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
getting what those premises are by

354
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,160
actually talking to people or inputting

355
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,660
those numbers or collecting those

356
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,040
numbers the data attribute for the

357
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,060
process

358
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,560
you want to make sure that the metrics

359
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
are repeatable and contextual data that

360
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
you context

361
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,440
that is appropriate

362
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,360
for maybe some sense in sessions not

363
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,980
just initial survey but getting a group

364
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,120
of people together and saying you know

365
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,440
what these are some of the things you

366
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,820
found on the survey this is where we

367
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,959
need to talk about

368
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,700
and a lot of that goes to building that

369
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
trust algorithm assessment right people

370
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,260
have to trust because the humans that

371
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,000
are going to fix those problems and that

372
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,740
comes from the credibility reliability

373
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,480
of this video

374
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,279
that's probably not a whole other talk

375
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,140
about itself but nobody want to go with

376
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,700
your metrics create that shared Vision

377
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,320
objects that says I want to deliver I

378
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,120
don't want to deliver and maybe use a

379
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
value stream uh techniques if you're

380
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,779
using them to align it to your pipeline

381
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,399
to figure out how all those things act

382
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,079
together

383
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,320
I'm probably talking way too fast but if

384
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,000
we go back to devops and we think about

385
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,920
a basic devops model

386
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,140
and why we're looking at devops we want

387
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,760
to create a flow right we want to create

388
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,000
structure that goes for uh for knowing

389
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,740
where our understanding is knowing where

390
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,600
our constraints are and making sure that

391
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,880
what we have moves forward over time

392
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,160
and the reason we want a smooth flow is

393
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,620
because it allows quick feed

394
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,300
it allows us to get the information we

395
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,399
want in the term of the metric it allows

396
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
that contextual linear data that

397
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,540
provides us the right answers to get to

398
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,579
the next step it allows our individuals

399
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,200
to fix it in the series to figure out

400
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,760
where our lowest big amperage or flow

401
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
stops it allows to maximize our value by

402
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,220
having those quick answers but then that

403
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,019
drives the continual experimentation you

404
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,660
learn which is a lot more metrics a new

405
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,880
metric is continual experimentation it's

406
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,160
putting in saying the metric I have

407
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,040
doesn't answer the questions I want it

408
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,260
answers a question but I need a

409
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,820
different question I need a different

410
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,860
sense of approaching it in order to get

411
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,360
the right answer or to get an answer to

412
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,740
eat something for me

413
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,540
uh and we'll talk about this a little in

414
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,279
the later slides where we talk about you

415
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,019
know that I haven't changed failure but

416
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,339
I don't really know what that means I

417
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,660
just got a rough number of rough

418
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,040
assessments

419
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,680
I've got a time to deploy but I've

420
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,139
modeled it and you know there's a great

421
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,579
quote out there that says once you start

422
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,380
gaining the metrics once you start

423
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,600
figuring that if I get a good metric I

424
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,579
get a promotion those metrics no longer

425
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,500
matter because what you have is instead

426
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,240
of getting a true metric a true analysis

427
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,339
of what's out there you started gaming

428
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,839
and doing things to make you have better

429
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,820
metrics without actually having a better

430
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,060
system

431
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,779
so once we have the three ways

432
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,740
have four packs right four things that

433
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,940
we never normally look at to create

434
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,880
metrics the first is logs Logs with the

435
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,260
track of everything that goes forward in

436
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,500
the system they are based both on time

437
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,880
and a complete description so they

438
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,920
include all those calls all those apis

439
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,720
all those references back all that

440
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,000
registration all goes into that big huge

441
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
thing right and that could be good and

442
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,120
we can build metrics off of that but

443
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,320
it's not always

444
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,240
so sometimes we just use traces which

445
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,160
are the specialized type of volume which

446
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,660
track is the input and output for a

447
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,360
specific program one API or one set of

448
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,880
calls One servers or one server tracking

449
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,560
everything that's going on there so if

450
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,060
you have the right answers

451
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,800
the metrics have become a standard

452
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,360
measure degree to which is system their

453
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
property uh or process possesses some

454
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,980
problem some comparison or analysis

455
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,139
maybe it's how many users use over time

456
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,519
maybe it's the power

457
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,820
shooting the city uh by hour or by other

458
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,760
cents again lead time to deploy how

459
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,740
often how long does it take to deployed

460
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,480
or frequency am I deploying it

461
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,279
and along the way we also have

462
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,220
measurements which some people forget

463
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,940
measurements are just looking at

464
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,680
something and saying this is what it is

465
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,540
right this is how often I'm deploying a

466
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,980
good thing this is how often I'm doing

467
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,440
this but they don't necessarily have

468
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,820
that same sense of metric that they're

469
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,720
going to drive

470
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,120
it's just a number and we see a lot of

471
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,740
people who want to pass off measurements

472
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,620
as metrics they want to say I deployed

473
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,199
so many things and this is a lot we've

474
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,600
been able to we had a team that looked

475
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
at it and we said hey we're going to run

476
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,839
out of you know a scrum basis we're

477
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,100
gonna have these evidence which are

478
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,899
these huge stories and we think it

479
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,360
happens should take you six to 12 weeks

480
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,040
one of the team owners decided that

481
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,940
they're not doing this could be

482
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,500
installed on any version every time they

483
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,760
install the new version they were going

484
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,800
to pass off the metric so they looked

485
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,760
across the teams and they're like you

486
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,560
know what your team is doing 70 ethics

487
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,620
every week and this team is doing one

488
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,079
Epic every three months

489
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,120
so what's the difference why is this

490
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,920
team working so much better and that's

491
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,300
when you look at it you find out hey you

492
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,040
know what in context all they were

493
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,480
actually doing was installed and each

494
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
install took them about 15 to 30 minutes

495
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,500
uh so all of a sudden they they changed

496
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,760
the reference for the metric they

497
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,440
changed how they were looking at it and

498
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,320
they changed how they were going forward

499
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,120
so the four devops metrics and we'll

500
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,740
center for the rest we'll kind of

501
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,079
concentrate on these look at how

502
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,940
basic metric

503
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,000
adorable accelerated by the coal forger

504
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,920
tells you should have right tells

505
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,600
everybody what you have so what we see

506
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,040
is because she told that recommendation

507
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,000
happens

508
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,980
every organization starts up and says

509
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,959
I'm going to be agile devops starts with

510
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,880
these four rifles but they're not really

511
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,500
sure what they mean and they're not

512
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,180
really sure how to apply them other than

513
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,500
the fact that they haven't if they

514
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,300
happen they must be good right because

515
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,060
the book said it's good so lead time to

516
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,100
change the time takes bug fix to feature

517
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,480
any other change to go from the

518
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,459
development production

519
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,380
so when somebody brings me a new iPhone

520
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,660
when a user comes back and says I have a

521
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,279
wallet how long does it take for that

522
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,779
idea what's in the background all the

523
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,220
way in production for this thing is

524
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,720
actually fixed

525
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,760
uh now one of the things I saw this

526
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,279
really recently with the team that you

527
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,199
have on this one is they say okay we're

528
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,339
going to measure this but we're only

529
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,019
going to measure this with things that

530
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,399
we've completed

531
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,680
right any item that's done we have a

532
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,180
lead time to change and they were

533
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,279
feeling really good about themselves uh

534
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,600
and then we went back to the background

535
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,060
and looked at the issues we had and they

536
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,680
weren't counting anything that was

537
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,199
started announced so things that had

538
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,079
been put in as an idea that they agreed

539
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,699
they were going to work that they

540
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,680
prioritized and broke down but they

541
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,219
weren't finished

542
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,660
and that's a big change to that that's

543
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,220
right that's a big change to how you

544
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,260
look at that how you lived in advance so

545
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,119
that top metric is good but it's not

546
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,439
necessarily the best

547
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,480
uh the second one to have it more is the

548
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,919
deployment frequency the measure of how

549
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,540
frequently your team employees go

550
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,980
another generator right if we're

551
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,839
deploying we must be in good shape we're

552
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,000
deploying new stuff new items we're

553
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,679
doing great

554
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,059
what you see with this one is people

555
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,640
tend to gamify uh especially in large

556
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,319
organizations

557
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,940
they look at it they say well every time

558
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,760
I'm deployed to production I'm getting a

559
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,799
point because I have appointments

560
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,419
and that's intended to keep the

561
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,400
deployment small which it is because

562
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
smaller things get done faster and we

563
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
work on them faster but they take that

564
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,380
even further they say well every time I

565
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,840
write a line of code I'm going to deploy

566
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,980
I'm going to make those changes because

567
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,539
it's not fixing anything you have to

568
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,220
comment it out but it's going to deploy

569
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,799
and uh now I've got this huge number of

570
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,179
deployments for things that aren't

571
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,160
really deliver functional software

572
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,840
and then we get to the opposite of it

573
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,700
the meantime to recovery how long does

574
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,320
it take a device to recover on average

575
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,840
uh from those failures and the change

576
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,940
failure rates the number of deployments

577
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,260
in which something goes wrong on the

578
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,700
number of deployments at any given time

579
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,559
right how often am I deploying bad

580
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,600
things same thing you gamify if I'm only

581
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,039
deploying a line of code and I comment

582
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,240
it out it's probably not going to break

583
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,220
the overall program uh so I don't have

584
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,919
to worry about that as much

585
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,780
so so quick samples when you look at it

586
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,480
right if you start at devops uh and I

587
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
like to look at security it's just in

588
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,260
the middle okay you have all those

589
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,059
things out there so you have those four

590
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,100
basic metrics lead time to change

591
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,799
deployment frequency changeability rate

592
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,539
and meantime

593
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,940
those are great but there's probably

594
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,799
some other answers some other metrics we

595
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,539
want to look at in those things that get

596
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,740
us there first of all we don't have

597
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,480
anything that solely measures we don't

598
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,400
have anything that security Champion for

599
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
that security team to look at and say

600
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,700
where is my security in these devops

601
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,260
metrics are you calling it a change

602
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,000
failure rate because we've released the

603
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,039
vulnerability are you calling on any

604
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,539
time to restore how long it takes to

605
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,780
take so to add that New Passion well

606
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,520
that doesn't really sit there so if we

607
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,380
break out we use that same metric you

608
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,360
know how do I know what do I know how do

609
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,500
I get there these are some of the things

610
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,880
I kind of

611
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,860
whipped off and said you know maybe we

612
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,600
want to talk about pipeline success

613
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,220
maybe we want to talk about how often

614
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,380
those pipelines if we've got a good

615
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,880
pipeline we should have a high number of

616
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,740
failures if you're finding things and

617
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,240
we're fixing them on the left side of

618
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,620
the equation right

619
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,020
we're fixing things to identifying those

620
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,059
things to fix early in the process

621
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,380
anybody wants to talk about languages

622
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,760
maybe we've got a bunch of teams so

623
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,620
they're all using different languages to

624
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,120
get their systems through

625
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,340
on the security side maybe we don't just

626
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,600
want to talk about the failure they

627
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,559
didn't want to talk about how many

628
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,720
misses released I mentioned earlier

629
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,400
about those uh those code ingredients

630
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,380
are those cats are English maybe we want

631
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,340
to talk about how many of those were

632
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,980
actually released as we run the process

633
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,280
forward maybe there's a scandal and some

634
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,539
of the a lot of times we talk about test

635
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,240
coverage or test coverage as far as how

636
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,860
many things we're actually tested what

637
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,000
percentage of the code is actually

638
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,039
getting tested before we feel safe to

639
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,840
release and we get that in the Bible

640
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,940
maybe there's a scan coverage as well

641
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,740
how much are we actually scanning for

642
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,640
those numbers

643
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,500
do we have a set percentage that we feel

644
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,480
a safe distance move forward

645
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,100
do we remediate those smarter abilities

646
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,320
in a sense of Time how often do we fix

647
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,419
them how long does it take us to fix it

648
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,520
if we can fix cap one vulnerability in

649
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,360
three days

650
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
but it takes us six months they said

651
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,100
just download it into the system or it

652
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,039
takes a separate policy statement

653
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,419
because we're going to have to get

654
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:28,980
signed and prove that we need to wait on

655
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,900
somebody else maybe we want to know how

656
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,640
many of those vulnerabilities

657
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,260
how many of those tools are we using for

658
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,000
stands how many scans do we need for

659
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,580
release how often does it take we had a

660
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,020
team that was working and they've done

661
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,480
their desktop stuff and they built the

662
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,820
scan in the pipeline and they were using

663
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,620
the NASA State cast system to do their

664
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,660
scans and it was great everything was

665
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,059
going they knew what the risk work but

666
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,679
then they decided that it was taking too

667
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,179
long because every time they ran it took

668
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,740
four hours regardless of how much it was

669
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,780
scanning so they turned it off during

670
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,120
the week it only turned out

671
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,320
well

672
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,840
great idea right at the same time but

673
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,240
they're working in coding more religions

674
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
so everything had been deployed into

675
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,740
production before and they said to scans

676
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,360
we're running on the weekends and what

677
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,220
scanning everything new so even though

678
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,720
they shifted it left to start they

679
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,460
shifted it back right

680
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,380
and remove the process and now they're

681
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,760
changing that time so maybe we want to

682
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,740
know how many states

683
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,020
on the op side uh maybe we want to know

684
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,100
how long operations right

685
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,260
and how much time do you lose how many

686
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,940
analysts is taking to find a failures

687
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,320
I'm talking about changes

688
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,940
how many people do I have to take off

689
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,860
what their normal job is they put into

690
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,080
that to look at that family to the

691
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,059
process how many hours does it take you

692
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,559
to do that

693
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,120
how much time do I have available how

694
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,380
much time does it take me to respond

695
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,480
once it goes into the system when do I

696
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,039
know that I start that mean time to

697
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,200
restore when do I know that it becomes a

698
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,260
failure is it in my internal sense or is

699
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,460
it when somebody called me up and said

700
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,960
you know what I can't get into my

701
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,700
account I can't get to my checking I

702
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,159
need to pay bills what's going on

703
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,440
now that's one way to look at the other

704
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,940
way is we can look at calls right which

705
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,340
is our other devops model the culture

706
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,740
automation mean measurement sharing and

707
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,419
we can break it down the same way and we

708
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,860
can look at some of those things but

709
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,419
that drives us to some different types

710
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,120
of metric ideas as we drive forward

711
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,860
maybe in culture we want to talk about

712
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,659
happens maybe we're going to talk about

713
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,159
the number of events in Tech Global

714
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,020
reach retrospective couples how much are

715
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,640
we talking about in Russia to actually

716
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,200
go back and talk about the things of

717
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,880
trauma failures and one of the other

718
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,320
models one of the other metrics the

719
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,360
dashboards creating that awareness to

720
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,039
drive that discussion

721
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,299
maybe we want to talk about how many

722
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,400
automation tools we're using a lot of

723
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,900
our teams have a tendency to bring in

724
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,880
new automations new tools all the time

725
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,340
we saw the new shiny object and we break

726
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,720
that in as well and then we bring the

727
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,400
next one and then we bring the next one

728
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
and now we've got multiple tools all

729
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,059
doing the same thing and we don't know

730
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,740
what that overlap works we don't know

731
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,780
what that interaction between the things

732
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,700
again we get things like test coveration

733
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,400
test duration uh path coverage how many

734
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,740
was passed forward you have multiple VMS

735
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,000
that we're using the world we kind of

736
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,039
some of those with the deck maybe some

737
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,260
of them are larger

738
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,720
we talk about the lean right quality

739
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,600
establature review blockers and these

740
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,700
get on board that the team sets looking

741
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,400
at metrics right uh transparency how

742
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,740
much can we see uh when we're talking to

743
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,940
each other do we have a lot of chat

744
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,679
channels do we have a common bug here

745
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,980
everybody

746
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,340
for bugs fixed we have one for bugs

747
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,860
released we have one for user feedback

748
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,720
right and we can't correlate the

749
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
information between all those things to

750
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,539
get to the sense we want

751
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,159
so that gives us a great number of ideas

752
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,260
and a great number of things that we we

753
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,940
talk about or we think about

754
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,559
but how do we do it individually how do

755
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,539
we break back to those things and we

756
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,039
think about what are those steps that

757
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,539
you want to think about in your

758
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,100
advancing your metric and you're

759
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,240
starting with it so we're going to start

760
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,980
with the four door record so we'll talk

761
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,240
about some of those questions that we

762
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,179
have uh as we drive forward maybe the

763
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,980
first one we talk about is the only time

764
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,299
we take to talk about how long does it

765
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,580
take to complete an action what kind of

766
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,380
measurements what kind of systems are

767
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,179
they want to talk about when I talk

768
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,340
about story points I talk about hours I

769
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,500
talk about days uh if you use the

770
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,880
elastic tools the last thing I'd like to

771
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,620
talk about Azle that's your users are

772
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,480
actually putting in their actual hours

773
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,100
so instead of having that it took me

774
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,960
three hours to complete the section I

775
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,820
haven't completely one day whether it

776
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,919
takes me three hours or eight hours does

777
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,600
that affect my lead time to change if I

778
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,780
can only measure in days maybe I can hit

779
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,620
1.37 days of hours if there is something

780
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,960
else but I don't necessarily get it all

781
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,059
the time right maybe it's been work in

782
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,039
progress how much work and progress do I

783
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,158
have

784
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,240
or the other team has 16 but I'm still

785
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,799
changing those times I'm changing those

786
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,820
factors

787
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,780
to identify the constraints Advance

788
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,720
what slows down what factors affect my

789
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,760
lead time when I'm thinking about is it

790
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,980
that I have to wait for the end of

791
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,440
Sprint demo before I can release that I

792
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,820
need to get that approval as I step

793
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,500
forward or I can bring it back and do

794
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,299
something else

795
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,640
I say who built the task when we get it

796
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,580
is a customer building the task or

797
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,320
putting it back on that backlog that I'm

798
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,640
handing it off to a developer it doesn't

799
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,860
have interaction can I do a variant

800
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,080
tasks and very complexity I have no way

801
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,340
to measure between those complexities

802
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,559
but we see Historic Hotel the matter

803
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,940
with this one

804
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,919
we see managing the team structuring to

805
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,419
get to assign versus complete knowing

806
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,640
what the various parameters are and then

807
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,500
comparing the different features am I

808
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,299
focusing on the priority that I have the

809
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,400
priority for scaling as we go forward

810
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,200
how much work do I actually assign to

811
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,659
that team we see teams too often in the

812
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:52,200
sense of being overconfident uh in being

813
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,480
making the wrong judgment regularly take

814
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,740
on more work than they can actually

815
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,059
handle in the time they're supposed to

816
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,279
handle it right we regulate the teams

817
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,320
and they say well if the example is I've

818
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,299
done 38 story points last time with 38

819
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,279
story points of time before this time

820
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,200
I'm going to take on 60 story points

821
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,299
because I know we can accelerate Android

822
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,039
and then you go to that magic over time

823
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,480
and say how much did you play so well

824
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,539
you've never done more than 41 and

825
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,059
that's over the past six months so what

826
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,100
makes you think you can do this

827
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,380
an important caveat for this one to talk

828
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,600
about metrics and why I said this is 12

829
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,340
months if you don't have that Baseline

830
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,900
if you don't have that structure you

831
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,700
don't know how to build a forward you

832
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,220
don't have enough of a baseline to drive

833
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,260
and every time you make changes to that

834
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,760
team every time you start swapping

835
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,260
people out there integral to that team

836
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,480
your metrics are going to change and

837
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,620
they're going to change a lot to the

838
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,240
point where you need a new Baseline to

839
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,679
go forward

840
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,039
teaching this as a replaceable part

841
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,140
right they seem more like Legos well if

842
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,100
he was a a yellow Lego eight you know

843
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,320
little notches on the top and he's a

844
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,360
blue Lego it doesn't matter because I'm

845
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,679
swapping an eight beats for eight beats

846
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,200
right but they're not they make a change

847
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,580
in that overall structure and they make

848
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,620
a change in the metrics

849
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,600
and then of course we've got to talk

850
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,159
about security approach right how does

851
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,480
the change affect the vulnerabilities

852
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,419
that we have how does what you put in

853
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,299
lead us to the next change did I comment

854
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,880
out the MFA because it was causing

855
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,320
problems and I didn't have it I know

856
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,179
that said that single sign-on wasn't

857
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,100
coming till later so I can just comment

858
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,380
that out until I need it but I'm still

859
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,940
submitting the change

860
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,620
uh but it's going to take me a long time

861
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,539
to get that SSO working as I integrated

862
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,940
multiple tools are there impacts in code

863
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,919
delivery do I have the time and the

864
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,659
right teams to sign for security do I

865
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:37,919
have the champions in place who are

866
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,600
actually looking at it or do I have a

867
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,799
bunch of developers that are just taking

868
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,360
an initial look at it not that they

869
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,159
don't know security but they may be

870
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,659
taking a different look at than doing a

871
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,100
more integrated threat Model A more

872
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,260
integrated process

873
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,760
uh we talked about advancing the

874
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,200
deployment frequency

875
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,659
how long from delivery to production do

876
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,580
you know the constraints you have in the

877
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,200
delivery production

878
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,880
does production mean it's actually

879
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,919
delivered to the customer

880
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,360
this is one of the ones we see the

881
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,400
design measure the team says it's done

882
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,500
they hand it off product notification

883
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,659
says it's done they do the demo and then

884
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,039
it doesn't actually make it to the

885
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,120
customer even though it's in the

886
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,960
production

887
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,520
because they're still supplying to a

888
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,900
remote we're supplying it somewhere else

889
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,460
where someone has to go and download

890
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,320
that make use of that product as they go

891
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,820
forward

892
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,200
how do you know that it's been a

893
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,580
production are you getting the feedback

894
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,320
do you have the metrics and the network

895
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,580
analysis that people are actually

896
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,380
downloading and using them

897
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,840
uh we see a lot on teams but they

898
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,640
haven't they went out there but nobody's

899
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,080
using the new version they're also going

900
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,400
to use the old version they haven't done

901
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,720
the patch they haven't done the update

902
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,279
how do you make sure that you have the

903
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,960
awareness of that that deployment is

904
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,640
actually making sense

905
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,279
uh when you do the testing tool

906
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,039
what makes success in your test is it

907
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,179
just a check

908
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,340
uh this is another good story I had the

909
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,539
team

910
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,640
we briefed him on using devsec Ops they

911
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,799
were doing their initial transition they

912
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,419
called me in the next day they said hey

913
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,059
we've got this devsecops we've got to

914
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,460
answer and we put the scanner in every

915
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,919
time we finish the code and we're ready

916
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,380
for deployment it runs this game

917
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,059
I said great let's do a little hard to

918
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,620
talk about vulnerabilities let's talk

919
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,940
about what's actually wrong with those

920
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,460
deployments and how you're fixing

921
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,799
and the individual with me so what do

922
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,799
you mean so what you stand it

923
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,419
there's a log and it talks about your

924
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,679
probabilities

925
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,140
it kind of said oh I said well let's

926
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,720
pull it up right show me the camera

927
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,279
so we looked at the pipeline turn off

928
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,480
the scandals in there right to the left

929
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,159
every time I ran the pipeline ran the

930
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,559
scan and things were looking good and

931
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,380
variable for the scan except

932
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,720
every time you scan ran it countable

933
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,840
good uh so we did help him in the end we

934
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,640
got back we got it set for it actually

935
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,440
produces the log but once we got the log

936
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,399
because there's a lot of information

937
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,620
about it right it shows everything uh we

938
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,720
ran it difficult so they compared our

939
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,799
scan against our Baseline and identified

940
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,240
anything's different so any known risk

941
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,740
that they had or anything that was

942
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,779
changing as they did the employment was

943
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,580
coming back and then they could fix

944
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,960
those things instead of trying to fix

945
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,820
everything and get into all those cat

946
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,320
threes that we already knew we're going

947
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,539
to be no risks or accepted risks that

948
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,940
they didn't have to spend their time

949
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,799
uh so we make assumptions about change

950
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,419
when we're doing deployment frequency we

951
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:16,919
should identify those assumptions with

952
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,539
change we should identify the

953
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:19,799
assumptions we have we should write

954
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,820
those down

955
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,679
um these are things we want to

956
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,820
constantly be talking about right this

957
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,620
is where the dashboard helps to start

958
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,000
those discussions because we have that

959
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,039
measurement over time that shows us all

960
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,240
the processes are and how they go

961
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,559
through

962
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,260
so time to restore do you have a process

963
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,000
to recall that figures in your time to

964
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,460
restore you have to redeploy everything

965
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,200
in the production and are the only

966
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,940
people that can do that devs are you

967
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,320
running out of blue and green system you

968
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,840
have two different systems and their

969
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,059
graduate Futures you have a canary

970
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,279
employment that's telling them

971
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,140
and then you can use that again you can

972
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,419
shift back to another one do you have

973
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,179
the good site reliability engineering

974
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,340
tools right have you done a site level

975
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,140
reading that if you're depending on

976
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,700
something else if you're going to that

977
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,020
edge now you've got to get a field

978
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,600
engineer say x goes out there and resets

979
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,340
them on manual do you have the agreement

980
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,559
of them what their time

981
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,059
how often they're going to take without

982
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,260
fixing

983
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,820
and what are your indicators of those

984
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,140
which become a whole other set of

985
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,460
metrics right for the

986
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,840
service level integration or identity

987
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,940
indicators when you start talking about

988
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,500
these meantime restore you want to talk

989
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,240
about the root cause because if you

990
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,620
don't have a root cause you're just

991
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,480
going to employ

992
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,740
ment and that is the numbers just to

993
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,580
continue and nobody likes to see that

994
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,600
happening right you want to sit there

995
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,760
you get your system back up online as

996
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,679
soon as possible and you get them

997
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,360
working as soon as possible or if you

998
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,980
can't get the new version you can roll

999
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,779
back to the old version and it's still

1000
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,279
working for that customer they're seeing

1001
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,360
the same things

1002
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,399
how long does it take to discover how

1003
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,260
long did it take you before you started

1004
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,159
your store

1005
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,320
how long is that failure in production

1006
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,140
and what did it actually cost

1007
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,700
how long does it take you to fix it once

1008
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,740
you identify what will cost the security

1009
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,360
view the root cause for that threat

1010
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,860
model are they looking at the

1011
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,720
attributions for that are they actually

1012
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
looking at who's out there

1013
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,320
now an interesting note for this a lot

1014
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,000
on the commercial side we don't really

1015
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,700
care who did it to us

1016
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,380
right attribution doesn't mean anything

1017
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,179
unless I want to take attention I don't

1018
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,159
need to know necessarily all I need to

1019
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,440
know is that they did what happened and

1020
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,480
then I could fix it so we can't do it

1021
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,580
again

1022
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,200
how does that convert to implementation

1023
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,000
lead time how does this affect my lead

1024
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,039
time to time

1025
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,720
does it change the rate at which I'm

1026
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,980
getting new answers in if I was

1027
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,179
expecting to have a new version of

1028
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:37,860
production and I'm expecting to start

1029
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,679
getting bugs back right so I blocked

1030
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,039
some time with my develop valuables now

1031
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,720
none of those new bugs because

1032
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:52,799
what are some of the factors that affect

1033
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,840
the time items and slow recovery time

1034
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,299
restore management approval how many of

1035
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:58,320
you have been an assistant where in

1036
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,640
order to make a new Improvement in order

1037
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,700
to fix it you got to go back

1038
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,899
and it's two o'clock in the morning so

1039
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,159
you've got to get the manager up you've

1040
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:06,480
got to get aware of the decision you've

1041
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,919
got to tell them what that decision is

1042
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,779
that he's got to call them and improve

1043
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,580
the new change because she can't just

1044
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,320
release another girl

1045
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,720
is there an SRE you need to come we can

1046
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,700
fix these we could have a psychological

1047
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,799
leadership that has the authority it has

1048
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,659
the accountability to make those changes

1049
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,399
we can automate some of those fixes like

1050
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,320
we talked about

1051
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,580
hey as soon as I have it I go back to

1052
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,380
the old version restore up for the

1053
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,240
customers I'm good now I can work on

1054
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,220
fixing those new changes that I've made

1055
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,679
to move forward a help desk that can

1056
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,240
tier those requests and find out who can

1057
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,220
actually solve that problem is it a

1058
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,659
quick fix to the help desk console

1059
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,100
that's in the documentation the user

1060
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,559
didn't see it is it a slightly longer

1061
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,820
fix it's going to require a little bit

1062
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,080
of configuration a little bit of code

1063
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,059
the engineer or is it a whole new bug

1064
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,080
that we need to send back the

1065
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,779
development change to get through

1066
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,279
and how long does it take to get through

1067
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,559
those notification sheets right

1068
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,360
so advancing change failure rate we

1069
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,980
don't want to deploy failures

1070
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,840
find out why it still starts with the

1071
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,820
rooftops two great books which one you

1072
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,279
want uh assignments Simon cynics start

1073
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,200
with Y it's a process of the leadership

1074
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,960
at devops book but it's great in looking

1075
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,639
for some analysis right and give me the

1076
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,379
thing about how do you know what you

1077
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,480
know what are those factors and as I

1078
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,918
mentioned before John door measurable

1079
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:18,780
matters talk about Cape dots what are

1080
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,159
the things that make us successful what

1081
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,359
are the things that drive a school

1082
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,280
successful and drive us to those

1083
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
abilities

1084
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,060
uh we didn't compare those wives when

1085
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,500
you think about are we getting the same

1086
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,719
root cause over and over again we have

1087
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,699
that change failure maybe it's time for

1088
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,440
company-wise

1089
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,780
a company-wide training on that new

1090
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,280
version of kubernetes that was supposed

1091
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,560
to be used but have it always changing

1092
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,300
maybe if we understood what those

1093
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,399
processes were if we understood that

1094
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,280
common why across everything would have

1095
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,780
less families because we fixed it

1096
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,820
earlier in the process we build the

1097
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,399
knowledge we build the identification

1098
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,379
and partial success is what made it a

1099
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,359
failure at what point do we declare that

1100
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,859
it's failed is it when it brings the

1101
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,240
whole system down

1102
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,160
is when it decreases Network performance

1103
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,880
by 10 or network performance by 90 where

1104
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,859
have we set the standard of where we

1105
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,660
decide that this change would deployed

1106
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,640
that's actually pretty easy

1107
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,079
okay it's made through the pipelines

1108
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,940
we've had the tests we've had everything

1109
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,800
that's supposed to check but now it's

1110
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,060
still failed

1111
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,640
why is

1112
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,079
happening how do we measure when that

1113
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,839
failure happens to compare across

1114
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,420
uh so and we identify the premises it

1115
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,560
was just what I was just doing right

1116
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,060
around the failure what are those

1117
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,680
standards around affiliate moves forward

1118
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,660
uh what are some of the root causes for

1119
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,280
early identification you want to fail

1120
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,020
early we want to fail the pipeline not

1121
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,920
when it's actually deployed to

1122
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,960
production uh we want to gather our

1123
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,060
group together and learn quick uh

1124
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,660
failure is an opportunity to learn

1125
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,640
the more we fail the more we tell early

1126
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,020
the more we should do together is

1127
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,780
finding answers to accelerate our

1128
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,520
processes and accelerate our equipment

1129
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,500
it creates the opportunity for us to

1130
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,300
succeed in the future because we've had

1131
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,980
this small forward and that's what we

1132
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,359
want is the small failures to move

1133
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,540
forward

1134
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,960
so where do you go from here

1135
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,240
uh well first

1136
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,980
non-decision

1137
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,079
creates America or decisions created

1138
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,220
right

1139
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,500
anytime you make a decision you're

1140
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,599
creating an error set alarm process

1141
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,579
because even if you don't think there's

1142
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,160
an air there's going to be an error film

1143
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,660
there's going to be something that your

1144
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,400
decision makes that creates a problem

1145
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,380
and even as far back as hey I've got

1146
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,520
higher

1147
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,940
he's great he's got all the skills

1148
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,160
okay at some point he's going to make

1149
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,700
this because

1150
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,740
and that's going to create that error

1151
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,960
but not decisions not making that

1152
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,579
decision is kind of like disaster you

1153
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,260
need to have the information at hand you

1154
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,240
need to have the metrics at hand so you

1155
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,220
can look at what's happening and you can

1156
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,680
make an effective decision a useful

1157
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,480
decision

1158
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,060
even if it creates an error photo

1159
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,560
because the errors create our

1160
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,780
opportunity for success to create an

1161
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,339
opportunity to learn and an opportunity

1162
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,079
to move forward

1163
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,640
we say both of these go back to the

1164
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,040
second law firmative way too many

1165
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,960
engineering costs along the way the

1166
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,880
second long-term Advance is any static

1167
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,220
system attribute is going to increase

1168
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,900
if you have a closed system if you're

1169
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,760
not making any changes to it it's going

1170
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,740
to eventually fail over time nothing

1171
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,940
runs for

1172
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,579
even code right there's going to be

1173
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,839
friction development particularly

1174
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,099
running the process so you should be

1175
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,780
friction involved by doing things

1176
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,820
eventually there's going to be some

1177
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,820
entries chaos you're going to have to

1178
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,339
make a decision to fix it because if you

1179
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,140
don't we're back to disaster things

1180
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,339
right

1181
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,339
identification

1182
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,119
and with that that gets us back to our

1183
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,980
metrics you have to know the basement

1184
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,440
you can't know what that base rate is

1185
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,420
what that Baseline metric is unless you

1186
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,520
half of it unless you have the metric

1187
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,500
geared to the way that you want that

1188
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,480
makes the most sense for your team it

1189
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,859
creates value and creates success

1190
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,339
one of the key ways we learn about

1191
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,079
making new metrics is the growth stops

1192
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,119
when our growth stops we want to model

1193
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,280
best tools we want to find why people

1194
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,099
stop if we know why the Girl Scout is

1195
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,660
there a metric we can use that'll show

1196
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,240
us that the growth is slow before we

1197
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,380
actually get to that stopping point

1198
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,900
before we get to that failure how do I

1199
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,520
identify

1200
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,280
how do I identify the various things

1201
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,020
around that metric that I need to know

1202
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,720
maybe I need new sensors maybe I just

1203
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,880
need a new metric maybe I need a new

1204
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,680
process along the way that does

1205
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,060
something different it shows me a

1206
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,099
different analysis

1207
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,500
we see those four ways to our metrics

1208
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,940
and we see the teams that go with that

1209
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,579
they say well we have lead times

1210
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,240
and I'm going to focus on those things

1211
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,599
well it only makes sense right if you

1212
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,160
look at those metrics and they're vanity

1213
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,720
metrics the only reason you're

1214
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,160
collecting metrics is because they make

1215
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,200
you look good they may not be helping

1216
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,240
your case or they may not be helping you

1217
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,859
improve even though they help their case

1218
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,780
management the expansion

1219
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,339
but the time is it's going to get to

1220
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,900
something that matters and it's going to

1221
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,980
get to something you have to do

1222
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,480
differently and you're not going to have

1223
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,619
enough collaboration you're not going to

1224
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,680
have enough basis uh

1225
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,020
I had a recent discussion and this goes

1226
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,820
back to uh

1227
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,320
people making assessments people are

1228
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,240
overconfident

1229
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,280
and I was talking to the individual if

1230
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,480
we were talking about how many items

1231
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,099
they had blocked over the previous event

1232
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,380
how many items they had blocked and what

1233
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,780
was blocked

1234
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,940
said well we've been blocked this often

1235
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,560
and this is what happened

1236
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,020
okay she said it's this organization

1237
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,020
they are blocking us they are stopping

1238
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,820
us from doing what we need to do

1239
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,400
I need you to go and prove that in the

1240
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,560
numbers I said I am happy to go and look

1241
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,660
at the numbers I am happy to go in and

1242
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,640
do all the research do the analysis look

1243
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,260
at your tickets look at the notes look

1244
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,839
at the code and figure out why you're

1245
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,240
blocked I came back to her I said hey

1246
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,859
you know the reason you were black is

1247
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:00,180
because your people were submitting the

1248
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,200
wrong information about your

1249
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,579
organization to get the document

1250
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,920
approved

1251
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,359
if they submitted the right information

1252
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,920
they would have approved it today

1253
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,119
because they submitted the wrong

1254
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,859
information they took a week to review

1255
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,599
it they took another we need to look at

1256
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,859
and they sent it back and said you sent

1257
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:15,240
us the wrong information really need

1258
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,339
this and then they went back and forth

1259
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:18,780
again

1260
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,920
and she said well that's great but

1261
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,300
that's still not the information I want

1262
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,859
I want to know how many days actually

1263
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:24,480
that Team Rockets

1264
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,280
I said all right they're not your

1265
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,980
primary cause but for the sake I

1266
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,180
remember we'll go back and look at the

1267
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,040
bedroom so we went back in we looked at

1268
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,140
the metric we found out of 176 days

1269
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,420
their various code items were blocked so

1270
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,099
the various teams they were responsible

1271
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:41,940
for there were 43 days that were blocked

1272
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,880
because that organization delayed didn't

1273
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,260
have the right information didn't give

1274
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,460
them an answer

1275
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,700
well unfortunately there are 176 things

1276
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,020
other companies such as

1277
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,740
they were all internally because the

1278
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,300
folks

1279
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,339
folks so you got to know how the numbers

1280
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:00,720
you got to know why they're important

1281
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,700
what these suctions

1282
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,380
because that's what enables you to find

1283
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,680
that basement find that standard rate

1284
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,839
you know how to change

1285
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,520
and you do that through using metrics

1286
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,200
and through understanding your metrics

1287
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,200
and getting to the next steps

1288
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,480
thank you very much

1289
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,560
appreciate your attention

1290
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,119
let me go find this if you have any

1291
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,300
questions

1292
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,960
all right thank you for your time
