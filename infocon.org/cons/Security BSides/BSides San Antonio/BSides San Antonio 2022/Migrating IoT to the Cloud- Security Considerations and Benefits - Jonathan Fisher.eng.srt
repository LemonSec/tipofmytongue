1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:01,979
um hello my name is Jonathan Fisher

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,840
we're talking about migration io2 to the

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,880
cloud if you're here to figure out how

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,859
to migrate I2 the cloud I'm sorry this

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,900
talk is not for you this is me trying to

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,660
convince you why iot devices should be

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,820
in the cloud

8
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,560
great so who is this guy talking to me

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,180
who's this guy up on the stage hello I'm

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,039
Jonathan Fisher I'm a staff security

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,279
engineer at praetorian we do a few

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,619
offensive Security Services this list is

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,260
not a sell for the company this is we do

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,619
a lot of things web mobile Cloud iot red

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,120
teaming purple is an interesting

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,860
exercise where we're inside the network

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,079
we do commands and we see if they can

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,719
detect our commands externally look at

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,600
all from an outside perspective any

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,780
assets that we could see or exploit both

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,879
of those are the offense security the

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:48,899
reason why I have this up here is

23
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,160
because I've personally done all of

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,379
these services but we also do blue

25
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,840
team-esque services around threat

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,640
modeling secure development life cycle

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,739
the nist cyber security framework and

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,020
other things like IR and threat hunting

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,960
exercises so company does quite a bit

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,400
I've been here for about four and a half

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,280
years uh our engagements last from

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,140
anywhere from one to three weeks what

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,640
that translates to is I've done about

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,040
100 engagements which which is a lot um

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,960
I'm definitely not a expert on

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,659
everything but I've seen a lot uh so I

37
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,200
also have an ocpt sorry oscp certificate

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,619
well known in the ecptx which is a red

39
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,180
team specific series

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,560
um but you know what I could care less

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,880
about all that stuff we actually care

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,799
about my wife my cute dog look at him

43
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,360
with the ball and then I also have a kid

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,840
on the way which I am super stoked for

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,180
great so you aren't here to hear about

46
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,759
me what are you here for uh we'll be

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,380
going through an overview of iot

48
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,900
security the iot cloud components that's

49
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,100
actually relevant for iot and then also

50
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,759
iot use and AWS Azure and gcp

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,360
we also have time for Q a uh afterwards

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,000
so uh don't be aligned with this page

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,700
scares you so this is our engineering

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,579
alphabet soup when it comes to internet

55
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,860
of things that's what iot stands for

56
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,220
security also often consists of many

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,660
different components

58
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,480
and you can think of a device for an

59
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,780
example let's take a smart robot vacuum

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,640
let me take it apart there's Hardware

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,520
components inside of it there's pcbs

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
those pcbs may have debug ports I could

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,940
connect to

64
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,319
um it may have some serial

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,180
Communications to other chips on the

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,040
board that's all interesting to test

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,260
there may be some external i o

68
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,760
interfaces that could be as something

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,420
like an SD card or USB interface and

70
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,000
also memory on the device itself and so

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
there's a few common ones like eproms by

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,280
flash emmc which is an embedded SD card

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,940
and then secure enclaves like a TPM

74
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,599
another common attack surface for iot is

75
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,599
the firmware and software and I kind of

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,000
joined them together because often when

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,700
people think about the firmware of the

78
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,260
device the typically thinking about

79
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,660
embedded firmware what that means is

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,840
it's just machine ran code on the device

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,340
where software you can have just

82
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,200
portions of the software updated without

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,780
having the whole firmware updated so

84
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,459
things we care about there is input

85
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,480
handling business logic software updates

86
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,680
you can talk about the Linux if it's

87
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,420
running a Linux OS the security of the

88
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,340
Linux software and the security

89
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,140
functionalities

90
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,680
other things on iot security is the

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,900
wireless connectivity also internet

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,920
connectivity so ethernet Wi-Fi Bluetooth

93
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,620
zigbee and then finally that's all

94
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,120
device uh finally what we're actually

95
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,580
focusing on is this last little sliver

96
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,459
of it internet communications so for

97
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,980
example https

98
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,540
mqtt is a really common publish

99
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,060
subscribe protocol so this is used

100
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,340
whenever you have multiple devices that

101
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,220
want to subscribe and publish events and

102
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,260
they want to do it in a way that is

103
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,940
easily managed through this message

104
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,980
broker and they communicate is called

105
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,739
mqtt

106
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,680
so that's iot security at a broad level

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,500
so as we do security assessments what I

108
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,959
typically do is test these devices

109
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,639
however

110
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,040
iot security is not just about the

111
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,380
device it's actually about the whole

112
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,259
ecosystem so iot should never just be

113
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,020
only focused on the device yes that is

114
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,060
the majority of how we test the devices

115
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,400
but it should also include not just the

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
devices but it's mobile applications and

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,660
it's API services and Cloud Integrations

118
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,560
so uh what are common iot setups uh two

119
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,419
common ones is where the device connects

120
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,880
directly to the internet uh Often

121
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,740
provisioned by mobile app and this

122
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,800
example I have another

123
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,500
iRobot Roomba as an example of this iot

124
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,199
setup that's very popular another way is

125
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,120
you have a device that connects to a

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
Gateway and that Gateway is what

127
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,380
connects to the internet what you think

128
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,560
about this is for a Google

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,680
Hub a home hub we have these lights

130
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,419
that's not going to talk directly

131
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,460
through Wi-Fi it's going to talk through

132
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,280
a load a low range bandwidth with the

133
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,020
Hub and then the Hub is what connects to

134
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,258
the internet

135
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,360
so what are the things we actually care

136
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
about from an iot Securities perspective

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,740
on the focus of internet communications

138
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,600
number one is communication channels so

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,759
the way that the device connects to the

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,039
internet that channel is very important

141
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,620
to secure typically what we look for is

142
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,320
for secure TLS connections that makes

143
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,900
sure that data is encrypted and is

144
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
unable to be man the middle sufficiently

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,860
during Transit

146
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,600
another thing we care about is the

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,699
authentication and authorization of the

148
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:54,660
device

149
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,580
how the device handles and receives

150
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,440
input this could lead to things like

151
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,720
injection attacks and denial a service

152
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,080
of the device itself or of the internet

153
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,060
service that it's connecting to

154
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,220
um that's still just really General any

155
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,080
of the oauth top 10 would still apply to

156
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,180
this internet connectivity

157
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,539
other things that are specific to iot is

158
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,580
the provisioning so this is how a device

159
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,160
initially connects to the internet

160
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,900
that's not completely true provisioning

161
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,419
could also be done

162
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,740
out of band so it could be done during

163
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,020
manufacturing but for iot devices

164
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,360
especially consumer home devices there

165
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,919
is this provisioning step with like a

166
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,780
mobile application or some sort of

167
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,280
manual process

168
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,840
another thing that's really interesting

169
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,120
is the firmware and software updates how

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,759
a device securely receives and updates

171
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,319
its own firmware and software is

172
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,539
incredibly important so if we can manual

173
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,220
in the middle this firmware update

174
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,460
process we could possibly get bad code

175
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,259
on the device and then have control of

176
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,340
that device

177
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,139
another thing that's really interesting

178
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,240
is device logging so if we have device

179
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,120
logs we could possibly see how often the

180
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,460
device is connected and could lead to

181
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,900
indicators if there's any sort of

182
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,259
exploit against that device

183
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,500
great migrating to Cloud so this is kind

184
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,620
of the focus of the talk why Cloud

185
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,259
platforms why even do Cloud platforms to

186
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,400
begin with

187
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
um you don't need the cloud you just

188
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,400
need some sort of internet connectivity

189
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,220
to call iot internet of things we don't

190
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,660
need Cloud however cloud is the future

191
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,460
for iot

192
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,960
why

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,479
first thing is scale so iot fleets could

194
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,440
be a hundred thousand plus devices out

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,840
on

196
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,060
the world and so how do you manage these

197
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,539
things if you have your own Services you

198
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,979
have to make sure all this can have

199
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,560
availability concerns all sorts of load

200
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,720
balancing that nothing breaks it becomes

201
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,759
very important Cloud helped alleviate

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,900
that scale

203
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,840
public key infrastructure so how a

204
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,940
device authenticates and authorizes to

205
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,060
the internet the best solution is public

206
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,699
key infrastructure and that is really

207
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,979
hard to do if you already have devices

208
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,380
out on the field that do not have pki

209
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,960
already installed onto the devices The

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
Way Forward is to have pki systems and

211
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,039
thankfully Cloud providers already

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,979
provide this from the from the box

213
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,199
also what's really nice about cloud is

214
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,699
that they already provide this logging

215
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,740
and monitoring aspect of iot security

216
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,539
that we want to have

217
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,120
other big benefits is that the cloud can

218
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,279
integrate with other Cloud resources so

219
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,760
if you have some sort of

220
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,799
ec2 or Lambda service that goes to the

221
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,419
internet you could have some sort of API

222
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,279
endpoint that then updates information

223
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,740
to the devices connected to the cloud

224
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,660
very seamless you don't actually have to

225
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,399
write a lot of services you can do

226
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,220
everything in your own cloud provider

227
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,660
there's also a nice defined registration

228
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,820
process what you find is how a device

229
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,100
registers itself there's many many

230
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,660
different ways you can do this and it

231
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,360
gets very confusing fast because if you

232
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,740
don't do it right you can have

233
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,660
vulnerabilities

234
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,120
another big thing is access controls so

235
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,040
once the device is connected

236
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,800
what should it be able to do should it

237
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,620
be able to publish to anything or say

238
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,080
hey I want to talk to this device maybe

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
or maybe not so Cloud allows us to have

240
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,180
this access controls other things are

241
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,160
vendor special features and we'll see a

242
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,019
few of those in AWS Azure in gcp

243
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,600
so before I get to the vendors we do

244
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,300
need some high level concepts of iot

245
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,040
core features none of the cloud

246
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,940
providers even goes this basic of the

247
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,440
cloud components but this is kind of

248
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,080
abstracted in my belief what you should

249
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,980
care about

250
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,380
number one is registration how a device

251
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,480
gets registered to the cloud we've

252
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,620
already talked about this could be out

253
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,019
of band during manufacturing this can

254
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,839
also be done pre-done in the cloud

255
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,360
itself so this goes hand in hand with

256
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,300
Device identity so inside the cloud you

257
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,040
can generate certificates

258
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,540
and then after you generate those

259
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,399
certificates in the cloud you can place

260
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,959
them onto the device during

261
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,360
manufacturing and so that's all part of

262
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,220
this registration and device identity

263
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,800
components that allow some sort of trust

264
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,740
between the device and the internet

265
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,959
another core component is message bus

266
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,360
how the device actually communicates

267
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,060
with the cloud the most common messages

268
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,519
bus is mqtt which is what we talked

269
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,140
about earlier which is that publish And

270
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,779
subscribe message protocol

271
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,120
another big component is data routing so

272
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,860
once the device is talking with the

273
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,399
cloud where does that data go does the

274
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,839
cloud Network pass it to its own

275
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,700
services does it send it somewhere else

276
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,339
all Cloud providers have this aspect of

277
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,560
data routing and then last is this

278
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
logging and monitoring of device events

279
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,620
should be logged and monitored

280
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,620
great there are multiple different Cloud

281
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,360
iot vendors

282
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,920
um but I did just want to focus on the

283
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,100
big three big names

284
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,380
AWS Azure and gcp

285
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,700
so for AWS it's called AWS iot core it

286
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,380
was the first one to get released it was

287
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,839
released in 2015 then quickly followed

288
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,500
by Azure iot Hub released in 2016 and

289
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,120
wasn't until two years later that gcp

290
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,000
had its own iot core service that was

291
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,339
released and so as you can see this is

292
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,140
all sub

293
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,620
um 10 years yeah the gcp is less than

294
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,320
five years old so this is all new and as

295
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,420
these pushes happen you'll see more and

296
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,640
more vendors start pushing to the cloud

297
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,820
other notable missions IBM Cisco

298
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,459
Salesforce things work there's a bunch

299
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,540
more than just these three Cloud

300
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,519
providers but they all do those core

301
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,019
components right here they will all do

302
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,300
the registration identity mushes bus

303
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,540
data routing and logging

304
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,120
okay so here is the fun part of the talk

305
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,620
AWS iot core uh this is a screenshot of

306
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,760
the panel and as you can see uh that has

307
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,000
uh the thing called a thing so it's it's

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,399
an older platform and what's consistent

309
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,620
with AWS is they have weird confusing

310
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,540
naming conventions

311
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,579
um so if anyone who's used AWS all their

312
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,740
services are these random names and the

313
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,300
names don't tell you anything about what

314
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,660
the service does uh so similar in iot

315
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,339
land uh I wouldn't expect anything

316
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,200
different but devices are called things

317
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,420
this has funny conversations when you

318
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,060
say hey I need to protect your thing

319
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,040
um and then uh like all right what thing

320
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,779
are you talking about like oh well the

321
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,959
thing in your iot Hub at that thing so

322
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,540
you can also use templates for Fleet

323
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,860
provisioning this is a really cool

324
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,920
technology so you see underneath this

325
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
manage column there's this Fleet hub

326
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
you can create templates that all

327
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,940
devices should have the same kind of

328
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,860
device state or information about the

329
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,240
device and you can do it during

330
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,459
manufacturing and so this Fleet

331
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,860
provisioning is very very powerful from

332
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,279
AWS and you can very quickly get devices

333
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,220
in the correct state by using this Fleet

334
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,540
hub

335
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,760
also device identities are handled

336
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,760
through x509 certificates these are very

337
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,740
nice to have because it already has this

338
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,060
trusted CA that is signed and by AWS

339
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,700
itself

340
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,200
but you can see on the left here there's

341
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,820
a bunch of these weird names so you got

342
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,279
green grass like what is that this

343
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,019
Wireless connectivity you have the

344
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:32,700
secure defend actin test and uh it is a

345
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,260
big steep learning curve that's one of

346
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,459
the key takeaways I want you to have

347
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:39,180
about AWS I know in the past four months

348
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,519
they've actually changed this View and

349
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,839
so this is actually probably a bad

350
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,760
screenshot to use but it is just to say

351
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,680
this stuff is moving and it's always

352
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,959
changing so it does take knowledge about

353
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,760
the services to even kind of get started

354
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,279
which is unfortunate

355
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,279
um other things about AWS iot core is it

356
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,220
provides ways for users to create their

357
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,519
own access controls so this is unique to

358
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,040
AWS

359
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,600
Azure in gcp does not allow you to do

360
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,700
this but it is very flexible

361
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,980
on the downside you can actually expose

362
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,079
security holes by creating bad access

363
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,380
policies so on the right what we have is

364
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,959
this access policy it's in Json and so

365
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,700
it has two statements one is an allow an

366
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,940
iot connect action and that resource is

367
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,940
the thing name and so that allows any

368
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,800
device to connect which makes sense you

369
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,360
want devices to connect

370
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,420
what's the next effect next statement

371
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,839
it's an action subscribe or receive data

372
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,199
you're allowing that but the resource is

373
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
this thing slash start and for mqtt

374
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,459
connect Communications this means it can

375
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,880
talk to any device anything

376
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,160
um and so what that is really bad is

377
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,199
that if a device is connected they can

378
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,240
actually receive and see any other

379
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,339
device update information so if you have

380
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,019
any sort of like privileged updates or

381
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,639
information this would be a

382
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,019
vulnerability that they're not aware

383
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,579
that they're exposing

384
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,339
kind of the worst example we have seen

385
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,800
this and exploited it is where you have

386
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,839
and allow publish action to Firmware

387
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
update topics from any device so that

388
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,519
means any device if you compromise it

389
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,300
obtain a certificate connect to AWS you

390
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,380
could actually

391
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,260
say hey every device here's where you

392
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,060
should update your firmware and I'm

393
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,160
going to give you the URL of where to do

394
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,420
that and I can put whatever I want in

395
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,940
there and if the device is not properly

396
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,880
validate that firmware update you can

397
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,740
then compromise you know hundreds of

398
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,720
thousand devices from one device this is

399
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,100
where these things can be very dangerous

400
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,920
if you don't do it right

401
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,019
um other things about AWS is that it's

402
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,180
message brushes over mqtt remember

403
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,699
that's the most common protocol if you

404
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,980
don't want to use mqtt you can use https

405
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,440
only through publishes messages you

406
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,820
can't subscribe

407
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,980
um and then you can also do mqtt through

408
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,500
websockets which is nice

409
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,540
um data routing occurs in the ACT

410
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,820
section so previously as you can see

411
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,320
it's kind of towards bottom there's this

412
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,360
defend ACT test it's not really clear

413
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,339
what act does and you have to know what

414
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,139
it does you have to go into it and see

415
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,699
what the functionality is but in this

416
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:21,000
case act section it allows data routes

417
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,760
to go different places so you can have

418
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,639
an act rule where if you see this

419
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,480
particular topic you can pass it to AWS

420
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
dynamodb so that example is the device

421
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,820
is saying hey I want to update my

422
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,980
information let's say I'm a robot I want

423
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,019
to update my state I am now vacuuming

424
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,180
and so I'm going to publish that

425
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,699
information to the cloud and the cloud

426
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,740
is just going to update a database an

427
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,440
AWS dynamodb that stuff is very powerful

428
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,300
you don't have to write a lot of code to

429
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,160
make that happen

430
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,259
um also what's really nice about AWS iot

431
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,480
core is that they also have these kind

432
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,040
of new features that are really premium

433
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,440
so green grass like we said earlier what

434
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,720
the heck is that green grass is a way to

435
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,880
kind of manage these things through a

436
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,980
seamless process so you can kind of do

437
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,439
graph queries or not graph queries just

438
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,819
graphs where you can take a Lambda

439
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,059
function go to this meshes route it

440
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,699
allows you to to

441
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,439
manage these iot fleets through a very

442
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,079
programmatic way directly in AWS

443
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,480
other things this device Defender what

444
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,859
you can do with Device Defender is

445
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,900
really powerful once it's submitting

446
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,880
events to the device you can have

447
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,160
monitoring detections and you can have a

448
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,620
device profile to be able to pick up an

449
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,240
alert if something isn't happening as

450
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,000
expected so if device is not behaving as

451
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,160
expected you can actually alert on that

452
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,880
really cool last is that low range Wan

453
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
this is useful if you want to be able to

454
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,280
do that device the gateway to internet

455
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,640
setup so if you have all these long

456
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,860
range

457
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,240
wired area networks that have this mesh

458
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,000
Network to the Gateway AWS does provide

459
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,860
solutions to do it through a more secure

460
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,620
way through their own pki so it's just

461
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,380
cool technology

462
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,440
great so that is AWS let's do a quick

463
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,940
switch to Azure so uh Azure has feature

464
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,179
reach feature Rich iot platform

465
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,700
but it can be expensive so this is also

466
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,640
typical of azure land so like we said in

467
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,160
the last bit AWS has weird naming

468
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
conventions typically Azure can

469
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,120
sometimes be very expensive depends on

470
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,120
how many service you have they have a

471
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,620
little bit more flexibility about the

472
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,660
types of devices they support so it can

473
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,980
support three different types of

474
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,980
authentication symmetric key self-signed

475
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,220
certificates and CA signed certificates

476
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,780
those first two symmetric key and

477
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,640
self-signed those are important to make

478
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,320
sure you get those right if you have

479
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,000
problems where you leak the symmetric

480
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,919
key for a device then you can run into

481
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,480
that same situation where you can

482
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,039
authenticate as a device you're not

483
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,480
supposed to be able to authenticate as

484
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,100
other things about Azure iot Hub is they

485
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,840
have this kind of strong push on this

486
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,980
Premium iot Edge device type and so the

487
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,620
edge is complicated because what you can

488
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,440
do with an edge is you can put a local

489
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,740
Azure Services onto the device itself

490
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,039
it's a very interesting technology

491
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,600
also what's really cool is Edge devices

492
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,179
can also act as a Gateway and you can

493
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,240
kind of configure per need basis on what

494
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,039
kind of device The Edge is supposed to

495
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,260
be this is why they've kind of centered

496
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,539
around this Edge premium device the

497
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,900
downside is it's just expensive to use

498
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,059
they are also really good at message

499
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,919
routing so they have very flexible

500
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,740
message routes you can send it to event

501
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,260
Hub service bus cues or topics storage

502
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,840
these are all Azure Services very

503
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,700
similar to AWS where you could pass it

504
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,220
through that act management inside Azure

505
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,640
is way more simple and you can easily

506
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,380
see what it's doing

507
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,000
it also has the most flexible message

508
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,820
bus so it doesn't just only have mqtt

509
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,280
and https it also has another service

510
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
called amqp and so it's another type of

511
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,039
publish subscribe message broker that is

512
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,179
a little bit more flexible and the way

513
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,220
it handles data so

514
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,860
takeaways there is that it has a lot of

515
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,380
options as your cares a lot about its

516
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,880
products and they want to have a lot of

517
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,200
features

518
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,299
other premium features is Microsoft

519
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,260
Defender this is very similar to

520
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,360
AWS where you have these device profiles

521
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,020
that will alert and monitor based off of

522
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,660
incorrect behaving devices and so this

523
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,679
is their own kind of way to have

524
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,080
visibility on their Edge this is also an

525
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,940
edge device specific thing so another

526
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,860
reason why they want everyone to use

527
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,020
their iot Edge devices

528
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,320
last one last but not least is gcp iot

529
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,340
core

530
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,000
this is Simple and Clean so if you want

531
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
to say I don't want to know anything

532
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,480
about these Services I just want it to

533
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,120
work gcp is your friend so if you can

534
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,700
look on the right it only has four

535
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,160
little paints so if we look back look at

536
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,840
all that mess I want two more back

537
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,059
that's also a bunch of mess we go back

538
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,740
to gcp

539
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,419
there's only four things registry

540
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,660
details devices gateways and monitoring

541
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,240
very simple very clean it does

542
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,100
authenticate a little bit differently it

543
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,100
authenticates RSA or x509 search but

544
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,280
they authenticate with the JWT that is a

545
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,900
particular way to authenticate using

546
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,380
Json web tokens but the same idea where

547
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,000
you sign data with something that you

548
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
own

549
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,620
it also has simple Gateway devices so in

550
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,080
the AWS world you have that premium

551
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,600
feature called

552
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,419
long range Wan and Azure world we had

553
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,280
this iot Edge it could act as a Gateway

554
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,640
gcp is really clean it just says Gateway

555
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,020
you don't have to think about what

556
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,720
you're trying to do it's very clear uh

557
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,820
also what's really nice about gcp is the

558
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,799
entire message bus is hidden we can't

559
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,260
control at all uh what it what's

560
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,679
happening underneath uh the hood so

561
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,559
um where AWS had a lot of customized

562
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,960
access controls you can have in gcp you

563
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,820
can't do any of that it defines what

564
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,679
that protocol is and the only thing it

565
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,260
cares about this device updates and

566
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,059
reads and writes so I know it's a little

567
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,220
bit hard to see in that text but

568
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,679
underneath that registry ID we have Pub

569
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,220
sub topics Pub sub is a special service

570
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,299
inside gcp and so by default all data is

571
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,919
passed to gcp HUB sub and uh and the

572
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,659
right the topic types there's default

573
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,840
Telemetry and default device State and

574
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,220
so those are kind of the two main topics

575
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,659
that will happen right out of the box

576
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,780
okay that was really fast I apologize if

577
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,240
I spoke too quickly but there are some

578
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,820
cool takeaways iot security is very

579
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,260
complex and it's hard to get it right

580
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,200
but Cloud platforms help alleviate very

581
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,059
big security concerns one is

582
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,740
availability you just want the device to

583
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,419
work and connect to the internet

584
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,760
the cloud helps alleviate so many

585
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
concerns authentication authorization

586
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,820
the cloud has pki built in if you have

587
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,320
certificates downloaded to your device

588
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,080
you're way better than most of the

589
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,760
competition because most devices don't

590
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,500
use a cloud at all they have their own

591
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,960
custom authentication mechanism they

592
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,659
have their own session key that you can

593
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,400
use to authenticate there's many

594
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,880
problems with those types of

595
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,100
authentication that pki helps solve

596
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,400
those problems another big is logging

597
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,419
and monitoring we've already talked

598
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,880
about this but the idea of having device

599
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,760
logs you know it doesn't sound new

600
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,980
because we're used to logging but in the

601
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,020
iot space it is very new you don't

602
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,940
typically send logs to the internet and

603
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,740
they're not monitoring these things it's

604
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,179
a very good thing to have it's kind of

605
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,679
the advance where things are going in

606
00:23:58,679 --> 00:23:59,700
the future

607
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,880
and Cloud will help do that for you

608
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,520
things can go wrong if devices are not

609
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,980
registered securely or access controls

610
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,480
policies are not following best

611
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,179
practices so just because you use iot in

612
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,620
the cloud doesn't mean everything is

613
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,960
happy and you have no problems you do

614
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,280
need to have some awareness of what

615
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,960
you're doing whenever you're migrating

616
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,380
your iot services to the cloud

617
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,460
no I know you all are asking which Audi

618
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,240
platform is the best

619
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,900
and

620
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,299
unfortunately there's no right answer it

621
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,940
really depends uh go figure on what

622
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,799
services you already have in your

623
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,900
network so if you're a company and you

624
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,539
have a bunch of AWS Services odds are

625
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,460
you probably want to use AWS for your

626
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,500
iot systems

627
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,940
um you know vice versa if you're using

628
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,559
gcp in-house

629
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,900
you probably won't use gcp okay

630
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,539
let's say I'm not that far yet I'm just

631
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,539
interested in getting my iot devices for

632
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,280
some sort of deployment I just want to

633
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,380
do some sort of development prototyping

634
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,780
on a sell my device to a company what do

635
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,679
I use

636
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,480
uh I would say research is a cloud

637
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,580
platform there are some interesting

638
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,440
Technologies in each Cloud platform

639
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,380
however each one does have its own pros

640
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,580
and cons so it is good to be smart about

641
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,559
it if you just want it to work I would

642
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,960
personally suggest gcp but if you want

643
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,940
to actually be in the market and

644
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,919
competing against large players I would

645
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,500
probably gravitate towards the AWS or

646
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,320
Azure world but you know there are

647
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,360
proper discussions about this you can

648
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,380
say you know I forget those three

649
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,700
providers we're going to use cellforce

650
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,159
cloud you know I like them so there are

651
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,080
a bunch of cloud Fighters

652
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,960
and that is it I know I am

653
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,820
quite early so we'll have great

654
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,260
questions I hope you'll have some great

655
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,799
questions and we can even ask iot device

656
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,419
specific questions if you say forget the

657
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,700
cloud how do you hack iot stuff that can

658
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,120
also help

659
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,000
as per usual if anybody does have any

660
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,140
questions please line up here at the

661
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,220
front and I'll give you a microphone so

662
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,799
everybody can hear you so come on

663
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,059
come on up I don't bite I don't know

664
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,779
about him but I know

665
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,799
all right uh yeah just had a quick

666
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,860
question on as far as moving your iot

667
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,500
devices at least from The Edge to the

668
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,940
cloud

669
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,620
um what does that do as far as like

670
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,600
reducing attack surface

671
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,820
um uh do any of these platforms have

672
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,880
anything on the lines of

673
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,600
um

674
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,460
not vulnerability management but more of

675
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,679
like patch management uh firmware life

676
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,720
cycles stuff like that

677
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,039
um I know a lot of those are usually

678
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,140
done in-house but doing these platforms

679
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,600
have those type Integrations yes yes

680
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,179
they do so uh great question thank you

681
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,059
uh Azure is probably the most forward

682
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,340
thinking on that so one of their premium

683
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,679
features of their iot Edge devices is

684
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,179
you have built-in firmware update

685
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,820
protocols and so it'll do the firmware

686
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,559
updates it'll validate the signature

687
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,299
which is very important so all those

688
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,100
protections are already built in for

689
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,240
Azure

690
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,419
um there are you know other things to

691
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,820
worry about from a platform perspective

692
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,700
so you know if you are storing device

693
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,620
data on S3 bucket you know you have

694
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,260
possible exposed S3 buckets so every

695
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,880
cloud provider also has their own

696
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,440
security concerns you know to think

697
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,600
about and I can speak more to those if

698
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,860
you're if you're curious what those are

699
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,500
but yes you don't

700
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,659
um you still have the baggage of

701
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,760
whatever provider you choose to make

702
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,080
sure there's no additional security

703
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,860
exposure

704
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,419
okay

705
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,360
um I do a lot of iot stuff myself

706
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,480
um I'm concerned because I've got all my

707
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,340
devices you know sitting in the house

708
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,080
communicating up to the cloud and

709
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,720
everything else uh what do you recommend

710
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,820
on you know securing your local network

711
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,260
from the standpoint of those same

712
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,360
devices that are reaching out to all the

713
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,520
cloud environments yeah that's a great

714
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,159
question uh So my answer is probably not

715
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,039
what most people do but what I typically

716
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,860
do is I place all of my connected

717
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,960
devices that's not my phone or my laptop

718
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,200
on its own subnet what that means is

719
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,419
that the devices cannot communicate with

720
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,640
one another I just expect that my iot

721
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,799
devices already hacked you know like I

722
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,720
should have zero confidence that

723
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,120
someone's not already on my device the

724
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,500
question is do you do you really care

725
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,320
like I have a smart vacuum at my house

726
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,419
like do I really care if it gets hacked

727
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,940
maybe like then I'll just disconnect it

728
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,240
from the internet you know like the

729
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,700
possibly you know you know but if it's

730
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,500
more concerning things like uh you know

731
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,000
baby monitor where people really care

732
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,100
about you know the securing of their of

733
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,299
their child

734
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,980
um you know you could be even more

735
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,240
particular about it but the way I go

736
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,860
about it is I just place all of my

737
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,200
devices that are not my primary like my

738
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,480
phone my laptop on their own subnet and

739
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,100
I just let them talk to each other and

740
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,939
everything else

741
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,279
so you mentioned that AWS has a steeper

742
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,779
learning curve

743
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,720
um they they often they'll have pretty

744
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,080
kind of good training yes um so if

745
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
someone really was agnostic as to which

746
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,500
one but they wanted to kind of get

747
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,559
learning on iot uh Cloud security would

748
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,380
uh do do you have an advice or could you

749
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,720
give insight as to maybe which Microsoft

750
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,960
versus Azure has better kind of training

751
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,760
um

752
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,620
uh support yeah that's a great question

753
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,179
unfortunately I probably don't have the

754
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,100
best answer the way I've even learned

755
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,960
about all of these Services was by doing

756
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,240
assessments on these devices and where

757
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,679
they would use different Cloud providers

758
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,140
and so I never came from this as a zero

759
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,179
knowledge type person but I would

760
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,340
imagine that all providers have some

761
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,020
sort of documentation I know AWS

762
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,240
typically has better documentation of

763
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,159
their services but you still have to get

764
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,200
behind the idea of like what is device

765
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,299
registration mean like what is it really

766
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,100
doing here you need to have some sort of

767
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,380
understanding of pki what is the device

768
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,360
actually connecting with how is it

769
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,860
creating some sort of message structure

770
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,500
in AWS there's a lot of stuff that you

771
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,000
can customize it can be very

772
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,500
overwhelming

773
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,960
um I would personally say like gcp is

774
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,779
the easiest learning curve Azure is also

775
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,220
good but sometimes their docs aren't the

776
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,240
best so

777
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,340
hi Robert um my question is more like

778
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,700
towards um asset Discovery for iot Stuff

779
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,620
um big organizations

780
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,140
um the hardest part of iot is figure out

781
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,059
what you have right right so in your

782
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,620
experienced what is like the most

783
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,919
efficient way to discover iot devices

784
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,840
um is it like it's going for the best

785
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,940
most affordable like third-party asset

786
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,399
Discovery thing or what has your

787
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:54,659
experience been with like in big

788
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,399
organizations trying to find like you

789
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,020
know cameras or smartphones or smart

790
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,700
watches that connect to your network

791
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,600
yeah that's a great question so uh again

792
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,100
I'm coming from a different perspective

793
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,960
because this is after the fact that

794
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,820
customers come to us to ask us to break

795
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,799
into their things and so it's very

796
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,299
particular about what products we're

797
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,760
testing we're not really inside a client

798
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,740
Network where we're trying to see all

799
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,500
their their devices so I would go

800
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,899
towards the asset Discovery

801
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,520
um software side if I was really

802
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,260
interested let's say I'm a big hospital

803
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,659
and I have you know hundreds or maybe

804
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,279
possibly thousands of devices it could

805
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,840
be like a printer and I don't know where

806
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,120
all of them live I would go to some sort

807
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,440
of software solution it would not be

808
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,020
easy for one person to do that I believe

809
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,059
there's actually one person tabling out

810
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,399
there for phosphorus that does that

811
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,779
software I think they're you know

812
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,279
they're a little bit newer but they have

813
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,840
asset Discovery and that's their main

814
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,559
core cell

815
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,520
I don't know if anyone's from that table

816
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,260
I was just like yes he talked about me

817
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,140
um

818
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,559
no I I had originally planned to have

819
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,919
almost demo sessions of each provider I

820
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,640
think

821
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,200
that would have been a little confusing

822
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,659
uh if I would have been scrolling around

823
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,640
each provider and going through all of

824
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,799
their features and descriptions people

825
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,080
would have gotten bored very quickly and

826
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
it just wouldn't gone as well uh so

827
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,279
that's probably the piece that would

828
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,840
extend this talk where you could be a

829
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,279
little bit more specific about some of

830
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,720
the things that they do that's really

831
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,240
cool they're cool Technologies it's cool

832
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,760
to know about uh but for the aspect of

833
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,179
iot security that weren't as important

834
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:49,620
of course at my job I do a lot of

835
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,960
hacking of things and I can't talk about

836
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,480
that so I wish I could but that is not

837
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,799
with besides that's with my company

838
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,460
so

839
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,760
okay uh the question was uh in the

840
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,580
conclusions slide what would be the best

841
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,679
practices to follow if they don't if

842
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,399
they weren't using cloud

843
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,360
oh yes what are the recommended best

844
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,279
practices in the conclusion section so

845
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,700
thankfully AWS does have some nice uh

846
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,820
documentation about this if you use the

847
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,640
device Defender let's go back to

848
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,179
AWS ID core

849
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,760
yes the vice Defender will call out bad

850
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,440
policies so this is why you know they

851
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,399
want you to sign up for their services

852
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,620
if you have any sort of bad policies

853
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,299
it'll flag it and it'll tell you why

854
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,760
this is bad or something that's alarming

855
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,260
um and so this is something to invest in

856
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,600
if you want to make sure you don't have

857
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,399
bad policies while you're developing

858
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,899
this thing so if if you don't know what

859
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:05,460
you're doing it may be a good idea to

860
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,140
enable these sorts of services as a

861
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,060
catch before you start implementing

862
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,020
stuff out for production uh for uh the

863
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,760
Azure world where you have kind of that

864
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,000
possible exploit this metric key the

865
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,639
recommendation is to migrate to x509

866
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,918
certificates signed by a CA that third

867
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,159
one is kind of the the future of making

868
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,099
sure of some sort of strong route to

869
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,260
sign devices the problem that happens if

870
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,239
you already have a thousand fleets you

871
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,679
know out there in the field right now

872
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,540
and they're not using some sort of

873
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,580
certificate based authentication like

874
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,020
how do you even start that first step

875
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,940
and so that's why you know they have

876
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,980
these other options like self-sign ca

877
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,918
certificates or uh metric key but the

878
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,379
recommendation would just be as you're

879
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,599
deploying or building new devices you

880
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,839
migrate to x509 certificates or some

881
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,339
sort of certificate based Authentication

882
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,540
foreign but it can be very complex if

883
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,980
someone asked me

884
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,119
um you know how do we secure our

885
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,440
manufacturing process for device

886
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,480
registration we're like oh man like it

887
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,460
depends on who's a manufacturer so

888
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,560
everything changes it's a very pretty

889
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,160
complex system

890
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,240
s

891
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,299
[Music]

892
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,160
[Music]

893
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,720
yeah that's a good question so the

894
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,040
question was is there any public

895
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,859
information I can share uh there there

896
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,020
are a few ones if you go to our website

897
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,140
praetorian.com we do have a lot of

898
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,640
customers and their own testimonies

899
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,700
about our products so one on our website

900
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,579
was a Samsung Arctic device that they

901
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,440
published so they were prototyping this

902
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,780
new device by Samsung and we came in and

903
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,880
we looked at it and found uh you know

904
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,619
possible vulnerabilities that they

905
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,240
quickly remediated before they went to

906
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,040
Market with it so it was it was a nice

907
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,079
success story where they had things we

908
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,640
found vulnerabilities they fixed it and

909
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,160
now they could go to market

910
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,240
other things one of our biggest

911
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,940
customers is Abbott Laboratories which

912
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,520
is they do medical you probably see them

913
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,280
with their Cova tests you know we we do

914
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,660
a lot of work with them so you can

915
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,400
imagine the type of medical devices we

916
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,380
may be testing with those sort of

917
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,740
products

918
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,859
yeah of course

919
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,279
nope one more question

920
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,060
um

921
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,680
foreign

922
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,260
yeah of course uh the question was there

923
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,300
are some documentation for network

924
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,640
security and application security but

925
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,440
not really for iot security like where

926
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,960
do I get started where do I where I get

927
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,240
um first steps so the question I would

928
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,760
have for you would be if you are

929
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,760
um trying to test the iot device or this

930
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,280
kind of cloud communication so that most

931
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,619
iot security tools and training is

932
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,680
around the device itself there is one

933
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,599
particular company we really like called

934
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,780
adify atify is a company that does

935
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,000
training sessions at black hat and

936
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,200
Defcon for this iot hacking type stuff

937
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
and they have a lab kit that you can buy

938
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,720
that includes hardware and it's

939
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,280
vulnerable hardware and you can use the

940
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,660
tools of the business to actually break

941
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,000
into the device it is a hard field to

942
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,440
get into because you actually had to

943
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,420
hack something that's physical and not

944
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,820
everyone has access to those devices

945
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,920
other really cool groups I've been a big

946
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,920
fan of it's the exploit T to RS group

947
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,839
they have a bunch of blog posts also big

948
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,780
Defcon black hat company and they have a

949
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,400
bunch of really cool exploits where they

950
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,320
would go and Route something like a

951
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,060
Amazon Fire TV something like that

952
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,780
of course

953
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,240
okay well I appreciate y'all's time

954
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,740
thank you besides for letting me talk I

955
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,380
appreciate your involvement and

956
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,380
apologize if you're expecting more uh

957
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,820
but hope you have a good time
