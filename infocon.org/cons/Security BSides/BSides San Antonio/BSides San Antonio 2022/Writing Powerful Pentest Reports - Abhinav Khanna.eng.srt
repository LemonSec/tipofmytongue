1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,780
so hi everyone I hope you are doing so

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,460
today I'll be talking about this very

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,560
interesting topic that is called as uh

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,380
writing powerful vintage reports so

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,740
let's just quickly jump into it

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,160
all right so before actually starting

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,760
with these slides I would uh quickly

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,080
like to introduce myself

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,199
my name is and I'm currently working as

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,539
an application security engineer also

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,059
secure uh apart from that I'm also

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,800
actively involved in bug bounties as

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,140
well and I remember oxygen protein

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,219
now let's just jump to the main question

15
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:45,559
that is uh what is a pen test report

16
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:48,660
can be considered uh as a final

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,399
deliverable of the entire engagement

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,079
which includes uh all the

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,340
vulnerabilities found on the aggregate

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,360
School

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,840
while the main purpose of the pen test

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,860
report is to you know craft uh

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,659
reportings are such a way that the

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,939
vulnerabilities identified it is shown

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,840
it's not only limited to that uh

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
we need to take care of a lot of other

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,860
things like the summaries or the graphs

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,960
or you know methodology things like that

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,900
because we have a vast audience that we

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,880
need to take care of so this report

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,920
actually involves a lot of other things

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,420
as well so let's try to understand why

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,420
let's let's see who is going to read our

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,460
report

35
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,979
uh it can see soon's project managers

36
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,220
the dev team application owners audit

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,040
team co-workers clients internal

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,680
security team or interns now if we talk

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,380
about csos uh they are the people who

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,060
are not going to dig deep into the

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,100
report but might be interested into the

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,920
tables or the uh the scan one graph the

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,799
scan to graph or maybe they want to see

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,259
the number of

45
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,340
high vulnerabilities or critical

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,659
vulnerabilities

47
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,119
so we need to take care that what the

48
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,239
CSO wants to see if the report is there

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,720
project managers so project managers

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,160
might actually have to go through the

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,920
entire report uh but they might not be

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,140
technically enough to understand what is

53
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,640
there in the report so while we are

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,180
crafting the report we need to take care

55
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,220
that uh we are writing in such a way

56
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,959
that these guys can also understand what

57
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,200
they put the drifting so the main target

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,680
audience is the dev team uh because at

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,239
the end of the day they are going to

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,040
look at the report the vulnerabilities

61
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,720
and the recommendations that they are

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,780
going to work on it so they obviously we

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,340
have to write in such a way like those

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,099
guys uh are understanding

65
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,500
so I was at the auditing so third party

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,040
uh third party audit teams are equally

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,440
important

68
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,900
because uh I recently went to a

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,540
situation where

70
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,500
um just a minute

71
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,599
where uh the third party audit team

72
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,140
asked us that why this vulnerability is

73
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,840
marked as fixed while it is open on the

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,040
uh scan one URL so some Miss happening

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
happened in the entire report and that

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,099
is how we got to know that third party

77
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,560
teams are on so uh interested in our

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,819
reports

79
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,400
so we need to take care of that as well

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,640
then uh comes the co-workers so your

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,459
co-workers might be interested to uh you

82
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,140
know what vulnerability have you found

83
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,180
out how you found out how you're

84
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,700
creating the reports so so the people

85
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,680
who are working with your equally

86
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,060
important when you're creating the

87
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,280
reboots because they can be used as a

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,019
future reference

89
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,180
then comes the client's internal

90
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,420
security team and uh those guys might

91
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,760
also also be interested in your report

92
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,980
uh to understand what you will

93
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,900
identified because we are the ones who

94
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,540
might replicate that timing then comes

95
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,860
the interns so in turns uh might not be

96
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,840
knowing what exactly a report is or how

97
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,140
to exploit a vulnerability but uh they

98
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,420
might use your remote as a reference to

99
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,760
understand how to create a report to see

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,560
how a scenario can be exploited and

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,418
again to use as a template or of user

102
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,000
reference so these are some people not

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,100
the potential target audience that we

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,139
need to take care of while we are

105
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,240
crafting variable now let's move on

106
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,720
okay so let's see what good report

107
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,419
writing can lead to the first is client

108
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,440
appreciation well a well-beared report

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,240
can really be uh good for your

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
confidence and your organization's

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,580
confidence because believe me client

112
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,259
optimization in any form be it

113
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,820
vulnerability identification report

114
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,220
writing is always a great booster to

115
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,220
your motivation and uh makes you perform

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,660
even well so that is the utmost uh

117
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,100
priority getting the client's

118
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,500
appreciation client retention

119
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,940
still

120
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,680
um the reason I mentioned is this

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,940
because uh we retained a client because

122
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,699
of the kind of report we were sharing

123
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,440
them the structure available there were

124
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,040
other uh consultancies that were working

125
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,900
on that same project but we were able to

126
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,080
retain it why because our reporting was

127
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,380
good it was better than others

128
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,360
effective communication

129
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,039
see the main point of the report is that

130
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,100
you are trying to convey the story of

131
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,259
how you found the vulnerability or all

132
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,660
extractor vulnerability and if you are

133
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,000
not communicating it effectively then

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,240
there's no amount of writing the report

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,539
so that again is an important point to

136
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,400
consider while you are creating the

137
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
report communication

138
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,940
deposit just like I mentioned before

139
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,039
your report can be used as a reference

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,960
can be used as a template for future

141
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,759
reference suppose you've created a very

142
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,620
good exercise reporter very good SQL

143
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,320
injections and that time used in the

144
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,199
future so that is again the plus point

145
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,160
for you

146
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,639
okay

147
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,280
new clients again this I have mentioned

148
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,000
this because uh a few years back we were

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,039
working on a POC to get a client on

150
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,199
board and we missed out on a few

151
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,539
findings but still we were able to pack

152
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,240
that project because our reporting was

153
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,580
better than the other teams so here we

154
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,500
were able to pack a project because of

155
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,120
our reporting skills and not on the

156
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,220
mobile variability identification

157
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,020
again a person

158
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,060
job opportunities

159
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,340
so again the reason for mentioning

160
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,080
business because recently one of my

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,120
friends got a job opportunity from one

162
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,100
of their clients because of her

163
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,919
reporting skills she was a good pen

164
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,460
tester but an even good uh report like

165
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,259
that and that is how she landed the job

166
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,900
in a better place so that is also a

167
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,940
point to consider

168
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,100
so while we have seen a few points that

169
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,740
can be good for uh for a good report

170
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,020
writing let's see what are not so good

171
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,660
report right the writing can lead you to

172
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,900
report real time your client come might

173
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,680
come back to you and say that a uh we

174
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,419
want you to edit this or we want you to

175
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,240
modify this to delete this this is time

176
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,520
consuming and this may not leave a good

177
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,400
impression of you and your organization

178
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,840
uh if the client comes back to you again

179
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,220
and again

180
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,759
second loss of Revenue the client might

181
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,099
continue to uh you know might not

182
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,960
continue with their organization if the

183
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,599
report does not meet the standards so at

184
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,520
one place we saw that we are including

185
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,500
the revenue by getting new clients on

186
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,599
board and buying it in the client there

187
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,039
are organizations who are going to lose

188
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,720
the track as well and which would

189
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,479
effectively lead to loss of Revenue so

190
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,240
that's a big one to consider

191
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,020
escalation

192
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,440
vulnerability or any other thing but if

193
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,720
the escalation comes for your report

194
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,120
writing uh believe we are going in the

195
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,979
wrong direction because vulnerability

196
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,220
identifications and intimidation can

197
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,380
still be a technical thing but the

198
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,099
report writing is not so technical and

199
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,500
chances of escalations for this is low

200
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,759
but if you're getting the explanation

201
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
for report writing believe me are

202
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,240
heading to the wrong direction

203
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,000
lack of trust your client or your

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,919
colleagues might stop reaching out to

205
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,779
you for any suggestions suggestions for

206
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,159
report writing

207
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,820
and that is again a very critical uh

208
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,860
point to consider for our own personal

209
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,719
group because it is going to lead you to

210
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,219
demotivation

211
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,839
safe mode

212
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,060
all these points are interconnected sent

213
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,060
out uh report rewriting and lack of

214
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,100
trust all these points are integrated

215
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,019
too it is going to lead you to

216
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,839
demotivate demotivation if you are you

217
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,580
know facing all this

218
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,519
and because of this uh there is going to

219
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,399
be miscommunication the the entire point

220
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,440
of the report writing is that you are

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,779
conveying your story to the reader

222
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,940
properly and if you're not doing that

223
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,279
then there is a huge miscommunication

224
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,140
happening and no point of writing

225
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,300
credible so whether there are the good

226
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,240
points or the bad points they are they

227
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,920
all are interrelated to each other and

228
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,600
you need to work on them

229
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,100
call it

230
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,060
so let's move on

231
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,860
now let's look at some of the things

232
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,160
that can be included in the report

233
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,440
let's start with a short description

234
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,080
about the application while this is

235
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,600
optional I would generally recommend to

236
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,880
add this in your report because it is

237
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
going to leave a good impression uh

238
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,080
about you and your organization that you

239
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,600
guys have put in the effort to

240
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,120
understand the application and what the

241
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,820
application really does along with it

242
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,160
you can mention the working date in case

243
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,800
it was provided again it's optional the

244
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,700
reason I have mentioned here is because

245
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,160
um instead of digging deep into the

246
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,620
emails to find on the walk through date

247
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,380
you can add this little thing in the

248
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,240
report itself because we are already

249
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,720
creating such a detailed document a

250
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,180
one-liner is not going to create a much

251
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,120
message than production values so if

252
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,680
you're working on speaking violating

253
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,440
committee that environment do mention

254
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,779
the production environment details as

255
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,980
well

256
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,680
URLs given for testing again you at

257
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
environmental staging environment

258
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,740
whatever it is do make sure that you are

259
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,760
in your report

260
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,399
and the reason

261
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,500
the reason mentioned is that I based a

262
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,459
similar uh I based incident in my career

263
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:50,640
where uh the vulnerability was fixed on

264
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,700
the rescanning URL but was open on the

265
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,060
URL given for scan one because there is

266
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,940
an URL and the first scan URL were both

267
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,260
different

268
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,500
So to avoid that confusion mention the

269
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,019
URL that is given to you each time for

270
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,899
the testing deliverable I guess that's

271
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,000
it given I'm not going to go deep into

272
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,519
it uh every time you're releasing a

273
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,320
report to the client you need to write

274
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,200
the version that's version to a V1 or V2

275
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,180
whatever way your company promotes

276
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,760
printational consultancy again that's a

277
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,040
given and I'm not going to watch into it

278
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,940
test credentials so uh if you're using a

279
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,839
mobile number or a email or username you

280
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,579
can and you should mention it in the

281
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,380
report but you should not include the

282
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,540
password the reason

283
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,300
um so for example if an intern is going

284
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,980
through a report and since the username

285
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,899
and password you might want to access

286
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,000
the application using those credentials

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,880
and might hamper the application so to

288
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,100
avoid that situation do not include the

289
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,820
password

290
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,920
the next three things I guess are given

291
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,380
in your you guys must be following it

292
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,440
already uh the company's logo the client

293
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,959
slogan your methodology

294
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,560
all right let's move

295
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,000
if you are working on an Android

296
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,300
application do try to mention the hash

297
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,860
of the application be it Android

298
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,620
arrivals the reason

299
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,279
um because the application versions keep

300
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,899
getting updated on the Play Store and

301
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,500
App Store to keep the exact version uh

302
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,200
locked you can take a hash using no

303
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,600
obser and the hash is going to include

304
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,180
mt5 details as such one details sa250

305
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,019
16. basically it is a very good way to

306
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,360
present the exact position that you're

307
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,940
working on so if you're working on

308
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,980
mobile apps this can definitely be

309
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,899
considered

310
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,600
but if you want to keep it simple you

311
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,700
can just go to the apps to our Play

312
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,940
store and just highlight the version

313
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,040
that you're working on

314
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,440
it

315
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,000
now

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,639
let's have a look at what csos are

317
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,440
interested in or the board of directive

318
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,500
people are interested in the graphs scan

319
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,720
welcome for example if you're working on

320
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,060
the application for the first time this

321
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,680
is what a graph we're going to look like

322
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,000
for example there are four

323
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,339
vulnerabilities reported in five or five

324
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,779
in medium

325
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,000
um seven seven lower one Indian

326
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,620
but this is what a graph is going to

327
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,240
look like this is interested in Adobe

328
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,040
these are the four vulnerabilities and

329
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,399
he might or might not go through these

330
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,079
uh POC of these five units

331
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,480
this comparison now this becomes a very

332
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,579
crucial figure when it comes to these

333
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,220
counts because this P the C show that

334
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,540
the board are detectors are going to

335
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,700
look at what work has been done by

336
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,120
waiting in fixing these findings

337
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,920
uh for example here two findings of

338
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,860
which two are not fixed uh in medium as

339
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,260
well so he might want to see what is the

340
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,120
count that is what what are the findings

341
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
that are still open uh what are the

342
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,860
findings that are closed or things that

343
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,959
need to be accepted by his team as a

344
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,839
risk so all these things these graphs

345
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,040
are going to be very helpful for

346
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,360
scissors

347
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,959
okay

348
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,019
yep so before we move ahead uh just a

349
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,500
point that uh we should consider report

350
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,019
writing as part of our job and not an

351
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,600
extra loan because it is a part of the

352
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,279
engagement we need to write the report

353
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,380
we should not consider it extra volume

354
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,180
the reason I am mentioning this is

355
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,459
because I have seen people who consider

356
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,740
this an extra load uh ideally they

357
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,680
should not so uh if you're talking to

358
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,540
someone about pen testing do mention

359
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,600
that uh all these steps Recon Gathering

360
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,519
exploitation post exploitation remote

361
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,800
writing is equally important and equal

362
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,079
emphasis is should be given to it as

363
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,339
well

364
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:51,779
okay

365
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,260
now let's look at the roadmap to create

366
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,420
your profile concept and it would

367
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,360
involve six to seven steps uh starting

368
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,940
from the vulnerability name and then

369
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,279
severity affected you are in parameters

370
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,279
description of the impact steps to

371
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,860
reproduce the vulnerabilities then comes

372
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,480
the remediation and the final will be

373
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,199
references now let's look at each point

374
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,500
uh one by one

375
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,420
let's start with the vulnerability name

376
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,820
color coding I guess that's given

377
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,000
everywhere I you you are using some

378
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,880
certain colors for uh

379
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,100
for writing the vulnerabilities in your

380
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,440
report but what needs to be taken care

381
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,380
of is stack for project a if you are

382
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,060
using three or four colors for high and

383
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,279
medium low keep the same for Project B

384
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,639
as well use the same colors same color

385
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,459
coding for all the projects keep it your

386
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,800
account do not do not change if you are

387
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,420
doing so

388
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,860
okay

389
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,220
now when it comes to description impact

390
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,399
keep in mind that you do not copy paste

391
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,899
the description and impacts from

392
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,480
resources like portrayal equinitics next

393
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,120
partner and things like that who was the

394
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,880
reason is that because for example you

395
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,680
copy it from somewhere some of the

396
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,480
blocks and there is something wrong

397
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,000
written so that wrong thing is going to

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,100
be there in your report as well

399
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,320
and the client might come back to you

400
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,019
and say that if this these things are

401
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,420
copy pasted what work have you done in

402
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,380
the report

403
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,839
to avoid that situation try to

404
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,540
understand the vulnerability boost and

405
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,699
write your own uh description and impact

406
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,019
afterwards

407
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,000
try to craft your own description here

408
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,459
use simpler words instead of technical

409
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,540
jackets

410
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,360
so because we need to take care of the

411
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,660
non non-technical audience as well

412
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,600
we need to use simpler words so that the

413
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,240
report is understood by them as well do

414
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,220
not create dual empty descriptions and

415
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,279
impact we are trying to tell a story of

416
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,320
how we exploited our vulnerability how

417
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,120
we found our vulnerability

418
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,180
and if we are writing in too long the

419
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,220
the person who is reading is is going to

420
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,199
get bored and might not be interested in

421
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,359
reading the report so we need to take

422
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,179
care that things are not too lengthy in

423
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,319
our report

424
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,980
okay let's move ahead and understand the

425
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,720
steps to reproduce the vulnerabilities

426
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,699
now

427
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,699
as I previously mentioned uh

428
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,099
nor do not keep it too technical because

429
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,720
there are going to be non-technical

430
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,820
people involved in the report reading

431
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,460
process and you need to take care of

432
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,860
them as well so let's keep it as simple

433
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,419
as possible

434
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,700
highlight the effective parameter in the

435
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,740
description where we are going to see it

436
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,559
further we need to keep in mind that we

437
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,000
are highlighting exact parameters uh to

438
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,820
minimize the developers effort to find

439
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,400
out the vulnerable parameter so that is

440
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
our job to highlight the effective part

441
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
so that they don't have to search for

442
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,840
that uh vulnerable parameter do not

443
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,520
misspell words

444
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,740
I've given you an example as well that

445
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,900
if you want to write custom but you

446
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,660
wrote costumes itself these are two

447
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,660
similar words but they both have very

448
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,580
different meaning and I'll show you why

449
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,480
and uh why and how I I am going to use

450
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
it the next is mention the exact

451
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,000
parameter that is affected if it's first

452
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,179
name with n capital in the request write

453
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,640
it that way do not use your own words or

454
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,620
do not use all small kids or all of

455
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,760
cookies try to uh try to write the exact

456
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,340
word that is there in the request itself

457
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,160
it's jQuery with Q capital and not all

458
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,039
small case or large kids so take care of

459
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,679
that as well do not write unnecessary

460
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,080
steps if they're not required if a

461
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,360
vulnerability for vulnerability of low

462
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,820
or informational severity can be

463
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,740
explained in a single step or two steps

464
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,960
there's no need to write four or five

465
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,720
steps to it you are unnecessarily

466
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,820
killing your time and you are going to

467
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,000
kill the redage time as well by doing so

468
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,419
let's understand all these points

469
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,020
so just like I mentioned previously uh

470
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,940
highlight the effective parameter we

471
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,380
have highlighted the search for

472
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,320
parameter View which is going to make

473
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,240
the developers work easier that okay

474
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,160
this is the parameter that is going to

475
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,820
work

476
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,160
and the parameter is search for the real

477
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,380
Capital we need to take care of it it's

478
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,720
not simply search for all small small

479
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,740
kids

480
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,140
so this is something that you need to

481
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,240
take care of

482
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,940
okay so we need to take care of

483
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,919
spellings as well for example this is a

484
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,020
vulnerability called a proper error

485
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,340
family

486
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,820
so one of my teammates actually wanted

487
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,679
to write that the application does not

488
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,559
handle the error properly try to use

489
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,980
custom error page but what he wrote

490
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,620
try to use costume error page

491
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,919
well it's actually it's it's funny but

492
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,200
when it comes from client that you have

493
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,360
written this it it actually leaves you

494
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,059
an embarrassing situation so understand

495
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,919
the meaning of the words and if you're

496
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,440
not sure you can always Google it

497
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,900
so try to take care of the words that

498
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,020
you are entering in your report

499
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,240
here as well so you can see that this

500
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,179
jQuery with Q capital and jQuery UI is a

501
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,700
different thing so try to mention both

502
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,640
separately they are not one

503
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,160
angularjs angularjs is JS Capital not

504
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,860
all small cases are uppercases these

505
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,320
little little things these things show

506
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,480
the client or the person needing it that

507
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,919
you are trying to create a near

508
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,760
duplicate report

509
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,200
the last Point what we said that do not

510
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,539
write unnecessary steps this is a

511
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,940
vulnerability called missing HTTP

512
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,059
headers and it we can write it as a d

513
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,580
notice that the HTTP security head is

514
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,039
around implemented that's it it can work

515
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,440
in a single step

516
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,880
now this is a completely wrong way to

517
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,039
report the same vulnerability open the

518
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,140
application go to sign up page reload

519
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,120
the page go to send the request to

520
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,000
repeater notice that it is another these

521
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,559
threads are unnecessary and not not

522
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,080
required you can simply do it in a

523
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,299
single step

524
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,240
now let's move ahead and discuss what

525
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,340
needs to be there in the remediation the

526
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,020
first part is again what I mentioned in

527
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,840
description about that do not copy paste

528
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,020
your medication from anywhere

529
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,380
if you're copying uh the remediation

530
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,919
from online resources the the dev team

531
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,260
might come back to you and say that hey

532
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,380
we have implemented these fixes but the

533
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,059
vulnerability is still open

534
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,380
how is it possible to avoid a situation

535
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,679
try to write your own recommendation and

536
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,960
try to be precise about it I mean try to

537
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,880
find the exact recommendation of the

538
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,659
vulnerability if you are not able to

539
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:05,280
write the exact remediation

540
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,260
try to give the journal recommendation

541
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,000
and do mention to the depth that these

542
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,679
are the general recommendations not days

543
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,020
and ones to avoid the confusion or

544
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,280
conflict

545
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,320
also remember that

546
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,780
a recommendation that worked for you in

547
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,320
a project a would not work employment B

548
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,260
I mean it can work but not not sure I

549
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,020
mean not delegate so you need to take

550
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,940
care of these things remediation

551
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,100
description impact

552
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,500
should not be copied from anywhere they

553
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,539
should come in your own language because

554
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,299
this is what the client is going to

555
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,600
think then uh that it actually

556
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,760
understands the vulnerability they

557
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,440
actually understand the impact and that

558
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,659
is why they are able to write it in

559
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,260
their own language

560
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,940
now when it comes to references we can

561
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,039
use references from ovas we can use

562
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,679
references from CW meanings or we can

563
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,360
use some from any traffic resources

564
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,700
things like Volkswagen and netspark we

565
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,520
can use them here the reason that I

566
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,799
mentioned previously that we should

567
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,440
avoid a ports fingers definitions in our

568
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,059
description as well because we would be

569
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,000
giving the references here and again if

570
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,240
the team if the reading team is going to

571
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,799
go through the references when they

572
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,840
might come back again and say you have

573
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,720
copy pasted from Portugal from OS what

574
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,460
work have you done or what effort have

575
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,320
you put it so you need to take care of

576
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,240
it

577
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,559
references that should not be included

578
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,919
is irrelevant links or any YouTube link

579
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,900
or competition companies so when it

580
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,020
comes to YouTube links uh some companies

581
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,240
might be having a policy where YouTube

582
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,080
is not accessible in that situation

583
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,299
these links become completely irrelevant

584
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,539
to avoid that situation do not include

585
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:55,460
videos links in the first place

586
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,840
okay

587
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,220
now let's try to see uh let's try to see

588
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,400
a few tips that can be used to improve

589
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,360
the report writing the first is uh peer

590
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,460
review so whenever you have written a

591
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,840
report ask a colleague to uh read the

592
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,299
report by doing so they might be able to

593
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,820
help you or guide you that this thing

594
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,559
can be improved or you can write this

595
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,500
here basically they they are giving you

596
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,539
feedback on the report and believe me

597
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,520
it's a very good way to improve your

598
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,740
report writing I used to do it during my

599
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,159
initial days and uh it's it's a really

600
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,280
good technique to follow read out loud I

601
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,100
still do it today in fact

602
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,500
reading out loud makes you understand

603
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,740
that the report is good or not if you're

604
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,600
reading it to yourself and you're able

605
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,159
to understand your confidence enough

606
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,720
that the other person would also

607
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,520
understand but if you're not confident

608
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,100
that you are not able to understand how

609
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,320
can the other person would understand so

610
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,780
this should be a definitely go to step

611
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,640
when you are writing

612
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,280
read reports by others just like I

613
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,679
mentioned previously

614
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:09,360
reading reports by others can be used as

615
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,120
a template or understand scenarios it

616
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,940
can also be used uh

617
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,179
as as a reference to how can you improve

618
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,299
your own writing or where is it that you

619
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,820
need to improve on or you can see that

620
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,460
you're actually working uh better than

621
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,140
the other person

622
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,779
so this is again a good method to follow

623
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,120
use of grammar check to the sentence to

624
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,100
this while you should not rely on them

625
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,700
but once in a while it is okay to go to

626
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,340
these Checkers and see that the sentence

627
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,700
formation your sentences are accurate uh

628
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,340
this can be really helpful to you know

629
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,679
reduce the amount of time that you are

630
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,179
spending on when you put

631
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,820
effective training this is a very

632
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,779
important point for organizations

633
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:00,720
uh so organizations are going to give

634
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,700
you subscription for platforms like

635
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,039
pinterested Academy or hack the box or

636
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,960
prediction lab things like that where

637
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,539
you can improve your Apple skills but

638
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,700
I've never seen a company giving

639
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,880
training for report writing and this

640
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,440
needs to be taken care of because

641
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,440
companies need to realize that report

642
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
writing is a part of the pen testing

643
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,120
engagement and it is an important part

644
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,919
especially for the people who are

645
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,299
entering into the corporate world or

646
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:30,539
entering into the security team

647
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,400
training should be provided to them

648
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
definitely provided to them because uh

649
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,260
if training is not there then they are

650
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,820
going to have a hard time understanding

651
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,500
the entire process

652
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,140
adequate time for report this is also a

653
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,840
very important time

654
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,620
uh

655
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,080
if adequate time is not given to you for

656
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,240
reports

657
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,039
mistakes are going to happen

658
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,320
you have given you have been given four

659
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,840
to five days for uh identifying

660
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,520
vulnerabilities but you have only been

661
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,900
given half a day to type the report

662
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,299
believe me it is not going to work you

663
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:04,860
are going to make a lot of mistakes in

664
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,799
the report a good report writing is

665
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,520
easily going to take two to three days

666
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,520
adequate time timing should be given to

667
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,740
you and your organization needs to

668
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,600
realize it that you have given

669
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,000
sufficient time for pen testing you need

670
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,380
to give sufficient time to report

671
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,380
writing as well by giving you only half

672
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,880
a year one a day it's not going to

673
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,980
improve your report writing at all so

674
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,200
for the last two points are definitely

675
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,480
for the companies and the others can be

676
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,260
used by individuals uh

677
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,419
At Last I would say that right like it's

678
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,360
a job do not think that this is a burden

679
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,480
that has been put on you it is a part of

680
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,700
your daily job and you need to be good

681
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,080
at it

682
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,659
if not good you need to be decent enough

683
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,059
to craft a report

684
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:58,740
