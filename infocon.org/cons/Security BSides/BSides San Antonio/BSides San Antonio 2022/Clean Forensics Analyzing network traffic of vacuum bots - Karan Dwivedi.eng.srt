1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,700
all right thank you everybody for taking

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,980
the time to come here and listen to me

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,740
for the next 45 minutes I promise dear

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,540
to God I'll promise I'll end this early

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,179
if I have good audience participation

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,820
right and this presentation will get

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,880
interesting as we go along so that's my

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,440
promise to all of you

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,199
all right uh my name is Karan uh and I'm

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,119
I'll be talking about clean forensics

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,880
it's some of the work I did around

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
analyzing Network traffic of vacuum bots

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,660
so with that let's get started

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,640
so quick intro

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,020
um I work at Google I'm a security

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,239
manager I'm actually my manager in this

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,160
room so hello

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,379
um please don't throw stuff at me

19
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,320
uh I I graduated from Carnegie Mellon

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,620
about eight years ago now uh spent a

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,100
good happy two years in Pittsburgh

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,140
um I also try to blog around security

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,059
engineering interviews and that's the

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,039
link for everybody if you guys are

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,719
interested

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,699
um in my spare time I also review like

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,440
conference Journal papers like to give

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,540
back to the community and travel and

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,380
give talks like this

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,939
so what are we going to talk about today

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,040
right in short we're going to look at

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,860
why even research vacuum Bots like what

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
is it about them that is interesting to

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,360
the security community

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,159
we're going to look at functionality I

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,619
know some of you actually let's do a

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,619
poll how many of you have a vacuum board

38
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,979
or want to have a vacuum board oh wow

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,299
awesome

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,180
okay how many of you think they are

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,659
secure

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,840
so I'm seeing somebody like

43
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,920
okay I see only two hands that thought

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,479
they were secure

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,780
brave brave people okay so we're gonna

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,340
talk about functionality just so because

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,780
everybody's on the same page right

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,979
there's going to be some Basics that

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:56,939
I'll cover

50
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,740
uh then we'll get into the more fun

51
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,600
stuff right we'll talk about how each

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,520
and every one of you in this room can

53
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,759
conduct the same research at home right

54
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,899
uh we'll talk about some of the security

55
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,538
and privacy concerns that that came out

56
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:10,979
of this research

57
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,860
and then I'll walk you a actual real

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,560
communication with a vendor and I'll

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,599
show you how that went

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,280
that will be the most fun part of this

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,840
presentation

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,459
all right

63
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,500
cool so let's cover the basics really

64
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,780
quickly right why talk about this vacuum

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,160
bath

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,220
so I you know took this diagram from

67
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,860
grandviewresearch.com

68
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,020
basically if you look at this graph it

69
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,940
shows you the you know the upward

70
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,840
trending Market of vacuum box so

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
estimates say that the market is growing

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,060
every year by close to 20 percent

73
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,040
by 2028

74
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,040
this is going to occupy 15.8 billion

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
dollars

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,260
and by 2027 don't quote me on that we'll

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,220
have 60.9 million of these vacuum Lots

78
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,440
just imagine these tiny things they're

79
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,980
all over

80
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,900
who are the key players right who are

81
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,580
those manufacturers that dominate the

82
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,440
market dominant is the wrong word but

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,060
let's let's look at some of the market

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,760
segmentation right so if you see on the

85
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,819
right the right hand side shows you the

86
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,860
level of consolidation that's at the top

87
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,260
right so as you go up the market gets

88
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,000
Consolidated and at the bottom it's more

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
fragmented

90
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,200
in this case they're right in the yellow

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,000
zone like close to the middle a little

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,700
bit at the bottom right this tells us

93
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,040
couple of things right it's not

94
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,319
dominated by one particular manufacturer

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,580
also it's not super fragmented right so

96
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,560
basically everybody can build their own

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,060
and sell it in the market and there's

98
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,920
going to be some people who are going to

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,239
buy it right

100
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,280
this is a very interesting observation

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,180
let's remember this

102
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,840
so with that understanding let's let's

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,400
talk about functionality what what are

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,980
Bots doing for us

105
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,840
okay so each bot can have different

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,940
cleaning modes right one is an auto so

107
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,040
you tell the bot hey go clean this and

108
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,620
it does its job right uh it tries to

109
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,420
figure out where it is maybe map your

110
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,540
room all of that fancy stuff right

111
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,899
it can also actually do Edge cleaning so

112
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,000
in this room for example if you have a

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,060
bot it can go along the edges

114
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,100
that's an interesting feature you can do

115
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,780
spot training so if somebody spills

116
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,919
something they can just say hey clean

117
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,620
that's what or you can go all in and say

118
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,419
I'm going to direct you at every step

119
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,740
you're going to turn left here turn

120
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,000
right there and you could do a manual

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,340
clean as well right a lot of bots that I

122
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,979
research did offer those features

123
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,800
okay some of the more

124
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,040
um advanced stuff is schedules so for

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,220
example you can say every Sunday

126
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,860
9am clean my house it'll do its job

127
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,600
um a few of them have like Health

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,120
monitoring and what I mean by health is

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,759
not like our health as in humans but

130
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,100
more so of like accessories like brushes

131
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,840
right it will tell you when to replace

132
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,600
your brushes you know all that jazz and

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,960
fun stuff

134
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,940
there's some more functionality that

135
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,100
comes with a bit more advanced spots

136
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,380
like you can have floor mapping right so

137
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,900
this is a diagram I actually mapped one

138
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,940
of these Bots and this was the result

139
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,100
right so the blue dot is actually the

140
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,220
bot right and what it Maps is like my

141
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,720
apartment essentially

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,460
yeah I'm talking about it in a

143
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,820
conference so anyway uh talk about

144
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,139
privacy

145
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,000
so some of the words can also do live

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,160
video which is very very interesting

147
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,220
right for people who said the Bots are

148
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,419
secure

149
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,039
um

150
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,900
anyway some of the features are offered

151
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,520
but the live video is actually very

152
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,840
limited

153
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,699
I can count on my fingers how many

154
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,039
manufacturers really offered that

155
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,560
but it's growing

156
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,880
all right so now with that basic

157
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,020
understanding let's go a little bit

158
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,060
technical right how do you actually set

159
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,100
up a bot you go to the store you buy one

160
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,979
what do you do right so I tried to

161
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,320
generalize some of these steps and show

162
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,020
you what happens this is not always true

163
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,880
but mostly true right so we'll go with

164
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,620
that understanding

165
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,199
first you have a phone right and I've

166
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,160
kind of sorry I've kind of included some

167
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,919
of the key components that you know

168
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
exist in a home network so for example

169
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
you have a phone with an app installed

170
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,180
this app is by the manufacturer of the

171
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,900
bot

172
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,880
okay they'll probably have an app that

173
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,020
you can install create an account

174
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,720
register and do all of that jazz

175
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,400
you have a cable modem everybody's

176
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,960
connected to the internet have a modem

177
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,580
and you have a bot

178
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,860
so these three things sit in that

179
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,780
boundary which I'm saying oh let's call

180
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,000
it our home network okay

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,740
on the right is your external internet

182
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,680
so that's the outside Network

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,660
uh basically you can imagine a trust

184
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,280
boundary between the home and the

185
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,199
external internet

186
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
so what happens right

187
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,979
you install the app and you say let's

188
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,960
create an account okay so you put in

189
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,180
your credentials you know you choose a

190
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,460
username password you put in some of the

191
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,720
details

192
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,280
and then it goes to the manufacturer

193
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,080
website creates an account

194
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,380
right cool next you turn on the bot all

195
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,440
right

196
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,000
it will try the app will try to figure

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,539
out is any of the bot nearby right it's

198
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,460
going to do a local search this is not

199
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,539
you know through the internet or

200
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,940
something it's just on your local Wi-Fi

201
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,919
and something interesting will happen in

202
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,539
a lot of cases

203
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,599
the bot is going to spin up a new Wi-Fi

204
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,620
network

205
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,900
it will have its own SSID right the

206
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,759
fancy name for Network

207
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,860
so it's going to say hey I'm here here's

208
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,440
my Wi-Fi connect to me right

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,780
the app is going to say okay cool let's

210
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,300
connect and the only reason for this

211
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,580
connection the sole purpose has been to

212
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,620
exchange

213
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,419
credentials for your home network

214
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,639
okay so you're sharing your own

215
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,099
credentials to the bot through this

216
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,419
wi-fi network

217
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,280
and after that when it's gets those

218
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,979
credential it says cool now I can talk

219
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,740
outside using your home network

220
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm going to associate myself with that

221
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,940
account I think you are my owner okay

222
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,580
and then it's gonna connect and say okay

223
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,919
we are all set this bot is in this home

224
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,419
for this account

225
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,099
really that's what happens when you

226
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,199
purchase one of these Bots

227
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,080
everybody good thumbs up okay cool

228
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,360
people are nodding awesome

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
okay let's talk about how you can set

230
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,200
this up yourself so

231
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,059
to not Bluff people

232
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,580
I did this at my home I promise I swear

233
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,159
and I took a picture

234
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,380
please do not be afraid of the picture I

235
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,120
know there's a bunch of wires so I'm bad

236
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,040
at wiring stuff but this thing works

237
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,779
okay but I'll show you in the next

238
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,760
cleaner version of this diagram how you

239
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,220
can set this up essentially the key

240
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,560
components here are the modem which I

241
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,360
talked about so that's on the right on

242
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,519
the on the table there there's a switch

243
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,019
in the middle and there's another router

244
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,899
on the left okay typical stuff and then

245
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,519
I have you know a phone and a machine

246
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,980
actually the set this laptop is on the

247
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,180
screen is actually the one that's

248
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,540
presenting right now so it's all real

249
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,640
um the important thing to note is this

250
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,399
setup is relatively inexpensive right I

251
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,260
was able to do this in like about a

252
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,120
hundred hundred fifty dollars you know

253
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,540
give or take

254
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,140
let's look at this with fun icon right

255
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,260
so here's here's the simplification of

256
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,959
that messed up diagram okay and this

257
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,720
this is how you can go about it so in

258
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,060
your home network right the black you

259
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,339
know box essentially

260
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,140
first is the cable modem I assume that's

261
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,760
plugged in right all of us are set

262
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,980
correct the app is already there we are

263
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,260
good there right the bot is powered on

264
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,880
connected awesome

265
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,680
there's three components that we'll talk

266
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,080
about there's an internal router the

267
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,700
blue one on the left

268
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,519
there is a switch right so I I call that

269
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,440
you know it has a mirroring feature

270
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,779
mirror Port feature and I'll talk about

271
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,940
why that's important and then you have a

272
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,140
machine which is actually running your

273
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,820
typical packet capture right nothing

274
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,200
fancy actually

275
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,500
so when the bot wants to communicate out

276
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,680
to the internet on and vice versa it's

277
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,540
going to send a packet through the

278
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,779
internal router that's going to go to

279
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,140
the to the switch that's going to go out

280
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,300
to the cable modem and outside the home

281
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,320
network

282
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,000
does everybody follow that trail from

283
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,339
the left to right okay it's also gonna

284
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,920
go to the packet capture machine because

285
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm doing a port mirroring on the entire

286
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,839
switch so everything I I can see what's

287
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,720
happening in my network through that

288
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,820
except the phone because the phone is

289
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,680
directly talking outside through the

290
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,260
cable model right so this setup will

291
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,899
allow us to really see the traffic

292
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,480
related to any bot

293
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,700
okay

294
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,519
all right we've been getting into the

295
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,899
real forensics part

296
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,899
so the sorry the way I actually did this

297
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,640
is I you know got a bunch of these Bots

298
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm not going to name them right but I

299
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,560
captured traffic

300
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,160
by doing certain things after they were

301
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,920
on so for example I captured traffic

302
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,779
when I was setting them up

303
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,120
okay I also captured traffic when I

304
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,339
issued certain commands like oh Go Auto

305
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,320
clean this stuff what happens on the

306
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,220
network

307
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,140
turn right what's happening on the

308
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,820
network so I'm doing this and I'm

309
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,380
capturing right I'm trying to figure out

310
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,060
what's being you know what's being

311
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,459
communicated in and out

312
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,200
and then I sat down with all those

313
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,180
packet captures and analyzed them for

314
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,980
hours to really dig down on what's

315
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,079
Happening

316
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,880
so here's an example right I'm not going

317
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,920
to name any vendors or anything else in

318
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,620
the stock but I wanted to show everybody

319
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,480
an example of you know typical

320
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,060
connection setup right I know this this

321
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,920
screenshot is a bit small but I'm going

322
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,720
to walk everybody through it

323
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,940
What's Happening Here is the bot when it

324
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,399
comes on and you say hey turn on it's

325
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,980
going to make a DNS request out

326
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,899
I've seen this generally to a Cloud

327
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,300
Server right because it's easy to talk

328
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,220
to and apparently cloud is safe as well

329
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,540
so

330
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,860
um and then it's going to get back an IP

331
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,660
for that particular vendor so it can be

332
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,779
like oh like talk to me dot

333
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,740
cloudservice.com right something like

334
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,140
that and then it will have the IP and

335
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,000
then it will communicate to that IP and

336
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,279
you know get along with its life so this

337
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,200
is a typical connection setup that

338
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
happens that I saw on the network right

339
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,800
and I have blurred out some of the

340
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,019
things that would have identify you know

341
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,240
vendors or anything else about it but

342
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,279
that's typically the first step

343
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,500
right

344
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,100
let's look at a move example so when I

345
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,560
took took the spot and I said hey like

346
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,480
can you turn right I want to do a manual

347
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,500
clean

348
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,800
so the command went from the app to the

349
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,180
Cloud Server

350
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,600
and then it was actuated on the bot

351
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,220
on the network

352
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,440
what I saw I have included on this slide

353
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,120
on the right

354
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,880
okay I'm not showing fancy Wireshark

355
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
screenshots because that's a lot of text

356
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,600
and bytes and it's confusing so I

357
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,160
abstracted out the details and this

358
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,660
included this

359
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,940
can anybody in the room guess what

360
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,959
protocol we are looking at

361
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,380
I hear like mumbles

362
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,740
UDP

363
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,899
mptd

364
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,120
like an iot format

365
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,360
exit correct it's XML

366
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,639
it's sort of like a super response not

367
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,380
exactly any more guesses before I

368
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,899
actually revealed

369
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,899
UPnP

370
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,240
um not really but you're getting close

371
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,760
to actually iot protocols

372
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,220
I wish not uh no it's not

373
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,639
so I think so people who said exam uh

374
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,540
sorry XML are closed it's actually XMP

375
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,300
yeah so what that does what does that

376
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,980
tell us

377
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,740
your board is actually a chatbot

378
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,060
it's it's just like I am for all of us

379
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,800
who say hi on Chat and message comes

380
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
back that's what really what's happening

381
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm saying don't write and he's like

382
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,320
yeah okay don't write there you go

383
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,779
um and the second observation is it's

384
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,040
all plain text

385
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,579
all right we'll keep going

386
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,019
let's look at a clean example because

387
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,760
this is the most this is why we buy

388
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,220
these things right clean stuff but when

389
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,079
you say clean right

390
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,100
same thing but look observe on the right

391
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,560
there is a very clear way to figure out

392
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,260
what commands you send so it says okay

393
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,980
clean Auto with a strong speed I mean

394
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,500
yeah you for sure right and it will come

395
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,120
back with a clean report and say okay

396
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,199
got it

397
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,660
right

398
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,519
this was very interesting to me it's

399
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,720
keep alive

400
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,720
so even when the Bots are not

401
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,040
cleaning

402
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,779
and they have a connection to the Cloud

403
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,399
Server

404
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,279
they are chatty

405
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,139
they are talking and that's what it is

406
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,120
so it's gonna say hey are you there but

407
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,920
by the way you you cleaned the house

408
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,199
right and yes it say yeah I'm still here

409
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,240
so that's that's traffic will be visible

410
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,519
to you know in the network if you

411
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,440
actually record it and by the way this

412
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,540
is not like this is for a particular

413
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,699
type of Bot or a particular you know I'm

414
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,980
not I'm not generalizing this but these

415
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,779
are some interesting findings from the

416
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,139
research

417
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,980
interesting stuff because we're in a

418
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,060
security conference what about

419
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,639
Authentication

420
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,300
do does anybody see a problem

421
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,060
it's bolded yes it's pretty much in bold

422
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,959
right

423
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,360
yeah so some of these Bots I'm gonna say

424
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,399
sum and stop myself there some of

425
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,839
because this is being recorded and it's

426
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,940
you know will haunt me for the rest of

427
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,220
my life uh but you'll see password in

428
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,600
plain text in some of these spots

429
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,639
especially when they're using the sasl

430
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,779
protocol

431
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,420
right and I think sasl has you know an

432
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,920
option to set you know plain text

433
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,199
passwords and you know the way you

434
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,880
configure it it's going to work

435
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,880
so anyway saw that freaked out when I

436
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,740
said Okay I want to see more why not

437
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,000
right

438
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,040
okay

439
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,139
in some of the Bots I was happy because

440
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,880
I saw mqtt

441
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,339
a little bit happier because it's it has

442
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,839
options to make it more secure so you

443
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,279
can have certificates

444
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,000
um

445
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,980
traffic is not in plain text so Kudos

446
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,399
there right and you'll see Port

447
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,399
8883 which is typical for mqtt traffic

448
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,620
okay

449
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,420
status now this was very interesting

450
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,180
this is not security but I'll get to why

451
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,740
I'm talking about this

452
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,740
so imagine I have this app right on my

453
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,139
phone and I just open the app just like

454
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,880
you open any app on your phone like a

455
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,579
call or or message right I just open the

456
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,420
app

457
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,459
and it was funny because when I did that

458
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,880
I actually saw traffic on the network

459
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,000
and I was like why like I'm not issuing

460
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,179
any commands I'm not doing anything

461
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,799
yeah it already he will talk about keep

462
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,540
alive but this is not keep alive right

463
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,980
so what's happening

464
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,839
Well turns out

465
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,079
it was actually communicating the time

466
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,819
from my phone

467
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,619
to the server

468
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,799
and the bot was assuming that it's in

469
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,260
the same time zone

470
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,240
do you does anybody see a problem with

471
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,500
this

472
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,860
much

473
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,600
it's getting the time from my phone

474
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,740
somebody said the schedule changes the

475
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,980
summer if I'm from somewhere else Bingo

476
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,740
exactly like if I go and travel let's

477
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,280
say Europe I'm in UTC UTC time this bot

478
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,080
in this case I was in California so it's

479
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,059
specific time right you see the TZ

480
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,160
equals minus seven there like the small

481
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,039
in bold that's showing the time zone the

482
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
time actually is in Epoch time so you

483
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,080
see those numbers 1651 in bouldered

484
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,039
right

485
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,200
if I move the bot is going to assume

486
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,299
it's with me all the time so it's gonna

487
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,580
mess up schedules

488
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,620
this is a this is an issue we'll talk

489
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,919
about when I reported it to the vendors

490
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,799
but let's remember that for a second

491
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,260
okay so we talked about functionality we

492
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,820
talked about some of the

493
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,280
concerning stuff we saw let's just say

494
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,840
that

495
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,059
um let's talk about let's summarize the

496
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,580
the security and privacy issues

497
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,140
so what about controlling remote

498
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,740
controlling and hijacking can anybody

499
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,580
hijack this watch and control them

500
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,700
well kind of sort of maybe right because

501
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,080
you need to be on the local network

502
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,059
right imagine right actually remember

503
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,580
not imagine uh all of this was on my

504
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,080
home network right or in this case

505
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
anybody doing this research is actually

506
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,620
capturing local traffic

507
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,480
I didn't see any way that any external

508
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,820
remote attacker can actually get control

509
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,000
of this but if you're on the same

510
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,020
network you can technically replay xmpp

511
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,420
right and it's probably going to take it

512
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,400
[Music]

513
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,760
what about the app credentials

514
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,160
remember the only way you are able to

515
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,860
control this bot is through the app

516
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,500
right and so if somebody knows your

517
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,960
credentials to the app they can control

518
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,900
the bot in on your behalf

519
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,940
not surprisingly there was no two-factor

520
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,860
authentication so

521
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,480
you could just username password your

522
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,820
way into different Bots all around the

523
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,939
world

524
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,780
floor plans so we talked about a little

525
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,640
bit about scanning right and different

526
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,820
floor plans that these Bots can scan

527
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,980
I try to look at like where are these

528
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,840
stored are they on the local device are

529
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,820
they in my account like what's happening

530
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,960
so in some cases they were stored with

531
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,820
the app and it's not really a network

532
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,440
forensics topics so that's why I didn't

533
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,620
go into so much detail here but in a lot

534
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,059
of cases they can just be stored in the

535
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:09,720
cloud

536
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,880
okay and that's again associated with

537
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,260
your account

538
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,559
so again the security of your floor plan

539
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,860
of your house is also dependent on the

540
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,039
security of your Cloud vendor

541
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,919
or the manufacturer

542
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,500
the whole icon of the cloud

543
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,360
I did not discover the good news is in

544
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,160
my research I did not discover that you

545
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,660
know I saw this going out of my network

546
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,080
so you know I can say that but it's just

547
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,059
good for us to know right what are we

548
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,780
really relying on

549
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,919
Remember the Time Zone thing we just

550
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,780
talked about two minutes ago

551
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,299
when I change time zones

552
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:52,559
in a way it's leaking my course location

553
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,419
right it's on the network it's getting

554
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,039
it so somebody's sniffing track traffic

555
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,200
at my home can actually figure out which

556
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,120
time zone I'm in

557
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,459
in a way I see your hand up there

558
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,520
sorry the question is did it go off a

559
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,360
VPN server

560
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,140
was it affected by VPN yes

561
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,620
so who's connecting to the VPN is it are

562
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,299
you saying the bot is talking to a VPN

563
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,980
or my phone is talking to a VPN and then

564
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,500
oh my phone is talking to a VPN

565
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,419
I have not tried maybe you can and tell

566
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,340
me how it goes in and they'll ever talk

567
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,620
here it'll be awesome

568
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,200
but thank you for that

569
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,000
I wish I had an answer though now you

570
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,860
got me thinking

571
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,659
but yes the side effect the side effect

572
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,059
of this is as the gentleman here in the

573
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,440
front pointed out it's going to mess up

574
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,179
your cleaning schedules so if you

575
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,740
configure the water you know clean your

576
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,860
house at 6 00 am not really not gonna do

577
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,340
at 4 pm or maybe worst 2 am who knows

578
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,740
and I actually noticed this because of

579
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,600
that I it randomly started one day and

580
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,820
I'm like something is wrong

581
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,460
and it was a time zone

582
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,679
all right video recordings we're getting

583
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,120
close we're getting close to the more

584
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
fun stuff

585
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
in the video recordings I actually took

586
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,940
a screenshot to show all of you here

587
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,580
the traffic on the left is actually the

588
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,980
video traffic that I observed

589
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,440
it's very nicely done because it's all

590
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,960
UDP right if you see the size it's

591
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,059
almost the same chunks the same same

592
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,100
size essentially right so if you see one

593
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,919
one six five one zero four five kind of

594
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,620
the same right and it's sent very very

595
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,480
quickly like my water shot was flooded

596
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,760
essentially so I knew it was video and I

597
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,620
could tell because I was actually

598
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,840
viewing the video at the time

599
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,299
when you examine these packets in depth

600
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,400
right on your right

601
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,440
the part that I've highlighted in red is

602
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,840
actually some metadata it's not the real

603
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,360
video data so we have some benefit there

604
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,039
and some some security

605
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,340
but there's stuff like hey message type

606
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,260
start streaming

607
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,419
right so you can kind of figure out if

608
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,760
video is on or off

609
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,730
in a way

610
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,940
[Music]

611
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,240
all right last part reported issue so I

612
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,179
took all of this you know after several

613
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,880
months and then I said hey I want to

614
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,480
responsibly report this okay

615
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,280
so the next set of slides is gonna be

616
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,900
bless you

617
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,580
um in the next set of flights it's going

618
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,400
to be a set of emails I wrote and the

619
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,500
responses and I'm gonna let all of you

620
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,020
in this room yes

621
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,158
what happened all right

622
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,740
so focus on the boxes in red in red it

623
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,539
shows that I'm the reporter it's

624
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,360
actually from my email so and there's a

625
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,820
date associated with each email

626
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,440
right I have not faked this this is real

627
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,320
and then I actually sat down very nicely

628
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,580
and I politely wrote this email

629
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,980
explaining how I found the stuff the

630
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,720
background and my concerns around this

631
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,340
and say hey can we get some action here

632
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,679
because these Bots are actually deployed

633
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,600
and people are buying this

634
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,900
so notice the time Monday uh 18th

635
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,720
November 2019. it's a small it's a

636
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,280
little bit small for a few of few in

637
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,780
this room so I'm just saying it out loud

638
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,260
okay 18 November I reported all of the

639
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,120
stuff don't have to read the email but

640
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,380
because you guys already know what we

641
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,039
talked about right

642
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,700
couple of things right insecure

643
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,780
protocols we saw XMP SL we also talked

644
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,100
about like potential Man In The Middle

645
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,280
on the local network keep going right

646
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,559
keep writing I don't know who read it

647
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,940
because they'll be like

648
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,980
really dude it's a long enough not a

649
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,679
female

650
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,880
course location tracking right through

651
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,640
the time zone issue

652
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,460
and finally floor plans again I was

653
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,380
honest about it right I said hey I

654
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,240
didn't find any leaks but maybe have a

655
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,080
look right okay game time what happened

656
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,379
next

657
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,600
they called the cops I'm still here so

658
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,280
[Music]

659
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,140
no answer

660
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,980
any any more guesses thanks but no

661
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,240
thanks oh wow

662
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,080
jeez I'll be

663
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,600
so somebody said our stuff is secure

664
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,120
thank you for telling us

665
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,719
okay

666
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,400

guys are awesome

668
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,000
no response actually yes that was

669
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,279
correct so for a month I did not hear

670
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,440
back in fact they closed my ticket

671
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,640
I should be enjoying

672
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,679
enjoyment and they also asked me how

673
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,659
would I rate their support uh good I'm

674
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,140
satisfied

675
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,480
sorry

676
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,880
well I had a lot more to say but I

677
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
didn't

678
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,080
anyway so I wasn't happy I actually

679
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,120
wrote back and reopened the ticket

680
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,799
I reopened and politely reminded say Hey

681
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,720
you know

682
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,360
um request to reopen can you please give

683
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,059
me an official reply and I also stated

684
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,919
the responsible disclosure deadline

685
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,740
which is 90 days typically

686
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,960
I'm not going out in the public like

687
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,700
this and talking about even now actually

688
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,919
I'm not right but I wanted to raise

689
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,539
awareness and I was very serious about

690
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,580
this

691
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,299
what happened next

692
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:40,919
sorry repeat

693
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,080
oh do you mean like closing the ticket

694
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,600
oh okay good one

695
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,400
sorry

696
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,279
they close it faster I don't know having

697
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,880
a bad vacation you know if that happens

698
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,460
I'm just trying to

699
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,900
start here oh this is not for my workout

700
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,179
so disclosure this has nothing to do

701
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,400
with my employers right this is all me I

702
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
have to say that but thank you

703
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,720
can't comment but maybe

704
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,260
and get in trouble

705
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,140
[Music]

706
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,419
so I got an acknowledgment actually all

707
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,520
right and so I'm not actually saying

708
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,260
anybody is bad or maybe they're busy

709
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,700
it's December right I'm not making any

710
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,440
judgments but I'm really waiting for a

711
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
good response I did get a response which

712
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,559
is good right

713
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,000
notice the date

714
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,100
December 17th

715
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,500
I reported in like 18th November right

716
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,880
so about a month almost

717
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,419
you don't have to read the whole

718
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,940
response but re focus on the bottom like

719
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,760
the last two lines

720
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,500
something implemented using xmpp we

721
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,120
talked about that right which is an

722
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,580
older model I understand I bought a

723
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,580
cheaper one okay fine or an old one

724
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,120
all our new models now use more secure

725
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,179
technology to ensure user information

726
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,100
securely

727
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,679
like what do you mean by like use more

728
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,000
secure

729
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,400
are the rest unsecured in sick like

730
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,600
what's happening

731
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,020
I had questions

732
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,640
and I didn't give up I mean heck this

733
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,140
was my vacation so

734
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,779
I followed up and I said hey no no like

735
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,240
okay thanks for the response but you

736
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,740
haven't really addressed can you assign

737
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,159
a cve can you give me a cwe something

738
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,440
right

739
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,779
three months later February and my break

740
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,200
is over I'm back right back to work

741
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,100

742
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,840
did point out right thank you

743
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,340
there was somebody in the crowd so

744
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,500
you're also right so they can say thank

745
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,059
you and say okay appreciate your

746
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,740
feedback and they pass the notes to

747
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,020
their app team I don't know which team

748
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,880
that is but okay

749
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,200

750
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,659
please let us know I actually do a lot I

751
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,220

752
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,220

March 30th so we're kind of ending the

756
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,600
you know the break and stuff and I was

757
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,360
like huh is there a response like I've

758
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,520
waited more than a month since the last

759
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,980
follow-up I reported the issue in

760
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,460
November last year it's been four months

761
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,960
is there a response have you guys done

762
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,700
something blah blah blah right typical

763
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,059
stuff

764
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,600

773
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:43,980
me

774
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,440
lawyers

775
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,380
okay good guess

776
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,059
sold it to North Korea I can

777
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,059
okay

778
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,720
by Design sorry what insecure secure

779
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,720
foreign

780
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
nothing happened actually I'm still

781
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,020
waiting for a response that's what

782
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,419
happened

783
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:13,860
in conclusion

784
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,720
um and that's what I wanted all of you

785
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,520
different right I wanted to walk

786
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,500
everybody through a method of

787
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,539
researching on your own this is this is

788
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,159
not you know all fun and games this is

789
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,799
serious stuff right I would say that the

790
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,140
future models right and this is 2019

791
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,120
2020 time frame we're on the pandemic I

792
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,520
have nothing else to do than this so

793
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,320
as of today there are more secure

794
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,299
versions out there right there's very

795
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,179
very few plain text but still you can

796
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,340
still repeat this methodology at at your

797
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,940
home for just 150 bucks potentially and

798
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,000
figure out all this stuff by yourself

799
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,820
for manufacturers it's very challenging

800
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,679
right they may use insecure protocols on

801
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,899
configurations maybe because they want

802
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,580
to ship the Bots really quickly or they

803
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,200
have some deadlines right so this is not

804
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,600
like saying vendors are bad just I'll be

805
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,919
very very clear right I actually

806
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,659
appreciated the response

807
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,880
but the the concern I have was there's

808
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,179
no way for a end user consumers like all

809
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,940
of us to actually get guarantees of

810
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,799
security when you're buying it off the

811
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,320
shelves can you say this is fine

812
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,500
right now I cannot

813
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,320
right this can be replicated at home and

814
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,179
finally it's kind of challenging to talk

815
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,980
to vendors I would say that it's hard to

816
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,559
get a timely response fix is also

817
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,960
debatable right

818
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,360
so with that I'll leave all of you and

819
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,559
thank you for keeping it clean

820
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,960

give you the microphone so everybody

sure for sure

834
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:21,320
this one or the previous ones

835
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,899
uh all right go way back foreign

836
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,760
have you found that any of these devices

837
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,460
were adverse to being set up without a

838
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,380
network connection as in to be able to

839
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,980
put the device down start it and then

840
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,779
proceed without establishing that

841
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:42,179
connection in my research I did not

842
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,000
thankfully uh it was it was always like

843
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,159
I initiated the connection association

844
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,840
with my account and then they started to

845
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,700
communicate I didn't see them in the

846
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,200
while just talking out that would be

847
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,820
really scary

848
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,960
yeah thank you thank you

849
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,600
we've got one question from online yeah

850
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,580
we have one more

851
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,440
online oh you've got one question online

852
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,899
sure it's uh from your experience what

853
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,340
portion of these Bots utilize

854
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,620
certificate pining to harden against

855
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,440
reverse engineering slash interception

856
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,840
that's a good question I actually uh

857
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,000
when I saw like secure traffic I did not

858
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
go into further detail about it uh

859
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,399
that's a follow-up I can take that I can

860
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,200
check that but if it's secure like if

861
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
it's actually doing stuff that I'm not

862
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,220
using plain text it's very hard to

863
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,940
research further

864
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:38,539
all right three good oh there's more

865
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,279
all right thank you so much
