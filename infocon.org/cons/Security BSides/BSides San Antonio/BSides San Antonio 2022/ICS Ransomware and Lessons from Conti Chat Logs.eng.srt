1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,399
over there

2
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:53,820
all right good morning everybody Welcome

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,300
to b-sides 2022 San Antonio and the

4
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,520
first track for track one in the clouds

5
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
welcome to the stage the owner of

6
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,019
Enclave defense Garrett miler

7
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,360
all right thank you as mentioned I'm

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
Garrett of Enclave defense and uh first

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,740
I'd like to like to thank beside San

10
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,659
Antonio for providing this opportunity

11
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,820
for us to gather together as infosec

12
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,220
professionals to network and learn from

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,500
each other and for me to share with you

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,740
some of my research on ICS ransomware uh

15
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,180
ransomware specifically targeting

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,100
industrial control systems and the

17
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,439
lessons that we can learn from Conti

18
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,720
chat logs

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,860
um

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,439
I have spoken at a conference before but

21
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,540
this is my first B-side so I won't skip

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,960
the customary about me uh slide

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,180
um I'm I'm from what they call the organ

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,979
Trail generation but technically that's

25
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,180
still a millennial so I think I'm

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,560
legally obligated to talk a little bit

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,880
about myself

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,399
um like probably many of you uh I got my

29
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,860
kind of the foundation of my career uh

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,159
is uh started in the military I was

31
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
active duty as an Airborne crypto

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,920
linguist

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,200
um specifically in Special Operations uh

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,660
or a dizzo if I have any of former air

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,280
Commandos in the room

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
um that job is kind of the coolest job

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,920
in the Air Force possibly um on paper

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,140
um I don't want to sound ungrateful uh

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,060
working with special operators was

40
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,400
incredibly uh awesome and I was honored

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,620
to to do training with Army Rangers and

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,840
and Navy Seals and things like that but

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
I felt my skill to be more valuable as a

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,360
cyber Warrior so since 2015 I've been um

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,879
uh helping the dod with their cyber

46
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,500
warfare Mission

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,099
um

48
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,560
as a part as a what they call a weekend

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,739
warrior and as a DOD contractor

50
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,780
um doing both offensive inside and

51
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,519
defensive cyber operations and a little

52
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,319
bit of a good variety of things from the

53
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,260
Strategic to Tactical levels of effort

54
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,680
um Enclave defense has been around uh in

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
some form or another since 2015 but the

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,879
only Revenue we had that year was me

57
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,280
selling uh t-shirts cyber themed

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,140
t-shirts to my fellow cyber students at

59
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,840
uh Keyser Air Force Base in Biloxi

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,599
um and uh but since the beginning of

61
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,940
this year I've uh left DOD Contracting

62
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,040
to consult in the private sector I'm

63
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,560
specializing in cyber risk assessment

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,379
and project management in industrial um

65
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,720
or in critical infrastructure

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,140
um this is my uh in chronological order

67
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,019
where I try to convince you of my uh

68
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,120
credibility as a speaker I already have

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,340
you guys here in the room but it'd be a

70
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,540
bit embarrassing if you got up and left

71
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,760
so here's the Rel here this this slide

72
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,940
is a relevant details of my life uh on a

73
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,760
PowerPoint slide right so I I personally

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,080
think these things just pretty much

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,720
demonstrate your ability to study uh

76
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,280
good reading comprehension and test

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,019
taking skills I am not that interested

78
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,120
about this portion I don't care to talk

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,340
too much about it um if you want you

80
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,080
know I'm always here to Mentor if anyone

81
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,640
wants to talk interested in these certs

82
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
I'm an instructor for Isa but um I'm

83
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,440
more interested to talk about my family

84
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,580
personally

85
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,500
um I've got a beautiful wife and five

86
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,840
hilarious kids and some cool Hobbies so

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,760
if any of those pique your interest feel

88
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,980
free to talk to me later

89
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,920
um all right so uh before we get started

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
I think it's important that we kind of

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,858
make sure we're on all in the same

92
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,899
playing field that we all understand

93
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,279
what I mean when I say industrial

94
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,839
Control Systems

95
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,919
um

96
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,060
uh ICS networks uh facilitate the

97
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,580
communication required to

98
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,240
um

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,100
for the control and monitoring of

100
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,280
physical processes so think uh HVAC

101
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,720
power generation uh the refinement of

102
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,540
raw materials the manufacturing of food

103
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,780
and and products that and and much more

104
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,360
um as a point of clarification some ICS

105
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
ogs

106
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
um commonly use the phrase operational

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
technology or OT synonymous with ICS I

108
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,500
personally don't do that

109
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,240
I because

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,740
OT is typically juxtaposed with it

111
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,240
and in my experience calling

112
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,080
icsot well in in the with technology

113
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,240
convergence that has been happening over

114
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,120
the years every ICS Network I've seen is

115
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,460
a pretty healthy mix of both IP enabled

116
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,919
traditional it as the dod might call it

117
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,620
with Legacy Oak T Systems and

118
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,780
unfortunately oftentimes people who

119
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,660
refer to their whole network as OT kind

120
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,600
of do that to justify keeping it guys

121
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,979
out from messing their stuff because

122
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,780
they think they're incompetent and the

123
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,639
physical processes which are there is a

124
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,320
legitimate concern when you're dealing

125
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,620
with physical processes but it's I I

126
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,440
think it's not a healthy uh Paradigm and

127
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,300
uh I I'm passionate about that topic but

128
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,960
that's not what we're talking about

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,639
today Enclave defense has been YouTube

130
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,020
channel where I talk more about that if

131
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,300
you're curious but ICS cyber security

132
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,580
has kind of been received more focus in

133
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,800
the last few years because of its

134
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
association with critical infrastructure

135
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,020
um and the increased risk that comes

136
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,960
along with oh I don't know Russia uh

137
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,720
hacking Ukraine's uh civilian power in

138
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,520
the middle of the winter or more

139
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,360
recently people panicking after

140
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,300
uh after an oil pipeline gets hacked and

141
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,639
filling up uh grocery plastic grocery

142
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,740
bags full of gas

143
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,220
um so yeah ICS can be fun

144
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,280
um so let's talk about ICS ransomware um

145
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,740
dragos I'm not affiliated with them but

146
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,539
they're a large company that specializes

147
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,979
specifically in ICS cyber security

148
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,440
in March they released uh their report

149
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,360
their annual report kind of covering the

150
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,620
the trends and issues that they're

151
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,720
seeing amongst their customers and on

152
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,419
the left there is uh indicates uh or

153
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,039
they they indicate ransomware as being

154
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,960
like a leading cause for the increased

155
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,220
risk

156
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,780
um that they're seeing in industrial

157
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,319
sectors and on the left they they is

158
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,940
there data on

159
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,160
um a sector breakdown of ransomware

160
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,020
victims that they've seen and you can

161
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,940
see 67 percent

162
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,940
um is manufacturing so

163
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,300
um and then separately they provided

164
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,880
um four key like high risk

165
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,639
um common factors that they found uh and

166
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,340
broke it down by sector and just to help

167
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,840
you see there

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,280
um I thought it was interesting that

169
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,220
wind food and beverage and rail

170
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,220
are the most vulnerable SEC or appear to

171
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,900
be the most vulnerable sectors based on

172
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,800
their common findings yet uh those three

173
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,319
combined as almost like a third like

174
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,479
almost three times as much uh ransomware

175
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,220
attacks are happening are targeting

176
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,960
manufacturing so I thought that was

177
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,699
interesting and kind of the basis for

178
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,440
this presentation

179
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,259
um it begs the question

180
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,240
oftentimes we're so focused on looking

181
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,680
at vulnerabilities and mitigating our

182
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,759
vulnerabilities because that's the one

183
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,400
thing companies can kind of do within

184
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,740
their control but when it comes to

185
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,539
racking and stacking those uh

186
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,180
mitigations prioritizing them

187
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,099
um you need to it begs a question you

188
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,900
know what else are ransomware attackers

189
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,699
looking at besides vulnerability what

190
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,819
other factors might be weighed even more

191
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,800
heavily than vulnerability at least

192
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,120
standalone

193
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
uh so

194
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,039
uh before we kind of get started I feel

195
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,060
uh uh intellectual honesty requires me

196
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,979
to address some of these analytical

197
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,620
caveats we have to remember that that 67

198
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,259
might look like um at first glance might

199
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,719
appear to be a disproportionate amount

200
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,399
of targeting towards manufacturing but

201
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,159
that might not necessarily be the case

202
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,599
um you have to kind of consider some of

203
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,640
these things this is where I feel I kind

204
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,320
of is my specialty is because is

205
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,120
catching these analytic analytical

206
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,820
caveats the we have to remember that the

207
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,100
data set is just dragos's customers

208
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,140
which is a smaller subset of all sectors

209
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,700
right they focus on Industrial sectors

210
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,839
and so yeah at the top left is uh uh

211
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,180
Palo Alto unit 42 recently released a

212
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,459
ransomware report covering all sectors

213
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,740
and so you see while manufacturing looks

214
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,600
so outsized when you look at industrial

215
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,120
sectors it's actually fifth in terms of

216
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
order when uh according to unit 42's

217
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,899
data

218
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,220
so

219
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,320
um and then also you have to consider is

220
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
dragos's customers

221
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
um equally distributed across ICS

222
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,260
sectors

223
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,580
um it's possible that they might have

224
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,380
like a niche they might enjoy like a

225
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,240
niche in manufacturing

226
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,800
um sector

227
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,860
um and let's say that that 67 percent

228
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,660
um statistic takes on new meaning if

229
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,519
let's say 70 or more of their customers

230
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,740
come from manufacturing conversely you

231
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,959
could think well uh maybe they're

232
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,880
finding it easier to get manufacturing

233
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,800
customers because more of them are

234
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,420
seeking cyber security services After

235
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,700
experiencing a breach or compromise so

236
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,019
it's kind of a chicken and egg situation

237
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,220
there

238
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,600
um you have to consider Regional bias

239
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,980
they've um

240
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,200
they have Global as far as I know their

241
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,779
customers are Global so does anyone here

242
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,300
work in manufacturing sector I.T

243
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,000
Instagram no okay well imagine you did

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,700
uh here in the U.S

245
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,519
it'd be good to know if you your your

246
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,279
opinion of your ransomware risk might

247
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,220
change if you were told that

248
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,920
um that let's say a huge chunk of

249
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,860
dragos's uh customers come from uh the

250
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,839
Middle East right

251
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,700
um especially when you look at unit 42's

252
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,240
numbers uh a big like half of of the

253
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,279
overall Target uh targeting is against

254
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,260
U.S companies so it actually might be

255
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,880
underrepresented

256
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,860
um your your uh ransomware risk if

257
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,540
you're a U.S manufacturer and then

258
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,920
there's Target density that gets even

259
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,380
more complicated uh they might have a

260
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,180
large sector in terms of like gross

261
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,880
output but how many companies are in

262
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,620
that sector are you dealing with a few

263
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,480
big boys or is there like a more

264
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,279
plentiful uh Target

265
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:50,940
um

266
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,000
start like so uh more plentiful targets

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,399
so anyways I've kind of opened up an

268
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,899
analytical can of worms that I can't

269
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,360
definitively solve

270
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,300
um my wife though reminds me of um

271
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,860
regularly reminds me of a mother's

272
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,060
intuition

273
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,040
uh I might be dating myself this is a

274
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,579
young crowd but she um you know she uh

275
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,800
and and even though I I'm a logical and

276
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,980
analytical nature I uh it's a phenomenon

277
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,620
I totally have to acknowledge and if

278
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,420
there's such a thing as a cyber security

279
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,899
analyst intuition uh my gut tells me

280
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,019
that manufacturing as a sector likely is

281
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,899
experiencing some just to some degree

282
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,860
disproportionate targeting targeting of

283
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,060
ransomware

284
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,680
um attacks

285
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,300
um and the rest of this presentation is

286
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,519
kind of maybe support that theory but I

287
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,380
I don't have the data to definitively

288
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,120
prove it I'm doing this on my spare time

289
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,700
my client isn't paying me to do this so

290
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,680
um and I don't have that we can't

291
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,420
because I don't have access to dragos's

292
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,160
uh information right

293
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
all right so

294
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,959
uh vulnerability obviously is important

295
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,240
but it doesn't exactly automatically or

296
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,459
directly mean you're going to be a

297
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,220
victim or directly uh increase your risk

298
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,680
there's other factors and this uh Jason

299
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,420
I think is his first name Christopher is

300
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,240
uh dragos is uh director of cyber risk

301
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,440
and he's got a funny tweet that I think

302
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,720
applies here he says that of things that

303
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,459
of the things that kids all children

304
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,160
need to hear things like I love you and

305
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,519
I I forgive you and you can do it uh one

306
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,880
of those is uh vulnerability management

307
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,940
is a uh is just one aspect of cyber risk

308
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,140
which is a complex function including uh

309
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,880
uh I can't read anyone else can read it

310
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,040
from there anyways threats and impacts

311
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,399
that's right impacts and threats so

312
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,040
um the function or

313
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
um equation that we often use to depict

314
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,500
cyber risk is basically threat actors

315
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,380
that utilize various ttps to exploit

316
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,820
vulnerabilities

317
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,279
um and that when that threat event is

318
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,500
realized it has adverse impacts and that

319
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,740
is what makes you have cyber risk but uh

320
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,440
threat can further be broken down into

321
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
uh resources I actually like

322
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,680
capabilities I forgot to change it

323
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,420
capabilities which includes resources

324
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,019
like funding and and personnel and their

325
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,399
motivation

326
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,740
um and I know this might seem a little

327
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,500
Elementary but I think Formula One

328
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,760
racing I don't know if anyone got into

329
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,040
the Netflix series but Formula racing

330
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,720
provides a fun kind of example of this

331
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,920
equation

332
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,600
um and I know this is a room of

333
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,300
Americans Texans no less

334
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,880
um but uh my my work has me engaging

335
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,500
with International clients so I had to

336
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,300
go with uh reuse this formula one

337
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,639
example instead of NASCAR so any NASCAR

338
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,740
fans I'm sorry but

339
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,500
um so Aston Martin is a is a Formula One

340
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,180
team and if they're assessing their risk

341
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,279
of losing they are going to look at

342
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,920
their the other competitors competitive

343
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,899
teams as their threats and they have to

344
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,339
look at their the weaknesses and

345
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,959
vulnerabilities of their own drivers and

346
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,420
cars that those teams can exploit

347
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,500
um

348
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,260
and uh and the consequences of not

349
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,899
getting on Podium uh and scoring any

350
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,579
points for their team at all

351
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,440
um but here's where it kind of gets fun

352
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,019
okay they throw

353
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,420
Aston Martin would be wise to not only

354
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,120
consider the capability of their

355
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,760
competitors but their

356
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,000
um but their motivation because

357
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
um if you don't know Aston Martin's like

358
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
at the bottom of the pack right now in

359
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,160
in Formula One and Red Bull the Red Bull

360
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,440
teams at the top so while arguably Red

361
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,940
Bull is the most capable of their

362
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,079
threats

363
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,700
um it would be wiser for them to focus

364
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,760
on the similarly ranked Haas team

365
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,560
um because they have their weaknesses

366
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,060
and straights because they have more of

367
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,860
a chance of actually beating them so

368
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,660
that similarly we have to look at the

369
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,100
Nuance when we look at what we're going

370
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,660
to look at is Conti I'm sure many of you

371
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,860
want me to dig into the country chat

372
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,760
line so I'll try to get through this

373
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,779
quickly

374
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,160
um but it's important that we kind of

375
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,839
understand

376
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,000
um what in order to learn from the Conti

377
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,320
chat logs

378
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,160
um

379
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,600
all right so let's look at the

380
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,220
ransomware groups

381
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,100
um from the ICS data that dragos provide

382
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,040
um here's the breakdown of the uh

383
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,019
ransomware groups and their share of

384
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,880
responsibilities targeting ICS sectors

385
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,220
on the right we see unit 42's breakdown

386
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,980
of the group's activity in all sectors

387
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,480
but if you notice I kind of caught

388
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,339
locked I'm like why is lockbit so low

389
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,380
most people don't aren't counting lock

390
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,540
bit and lock bit 2.0 separately so I

391
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,160
kind of fixed it I hacked it a little

392
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,199
bit and fixed it there so it's a more

393
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,660
Apple to Apples comparison but as far as

394
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,339
ICS is concerned

395
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,680
um lock bit and Conti represent um the

396
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,339
majority of uh of ransomware activity in

397
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,459
ICS sectors so wouldn't it be neat if we

398
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,740
could get a peek behind the curtain and

399
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,620
learn the the the the the motives and

400
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,360
the ttps and and the um uh being used by

401
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,760
one of these prolific ransomware groups

402
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,000
well boy howdy are we in luck because in

403
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,279
late February if you don't know

404
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,040
um the Conte is a Russian uh ransomware

405
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,959
uh uh located uh or centered uh group

406
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,899
so in late February or they posted this

407
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,620
announcement on their um on their uh

408
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,699
uh onion uh leak site supporting their

409
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,040
support uh expressing their support for

410
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,560
for Russia in their um aggression and

411
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
war against Ukraine well one of their

412
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,180
members happens to be um I suspect

413
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,519
there's some debate but I suspect one of

414
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,620
their members it was one of their

415
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,779
members who's a Ukrainian and they they

416
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:28,980
weren't too happy about that

417
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,139
announcement so they took to Twitter I'm

418
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,820
sorry it's so small guys you guys in the

419
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,560
back they'll teach you next time sit

420
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,440
closer up but uh he he created a Conti

421
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,899
leaks uh Twitter account uh for the sole

422
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,899
purpose of leaking uh a treasure Trove

423
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,839
of like I think close let's see in the

424
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,759
next slide I think it's like around 250

425
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,220
000 individual chats

426
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,800
um that somehow this person had access

427
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,060
to

428
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,040
um and with the message again you can't

429
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,540
see it it says like f the Russian

430
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,639
government like glory glory to all you

431
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,139
all glory to your Crane or something

432
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,380
like that so um so yeah here's kind of a

433
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,380
a high level summary of what the chats

434
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,579
look like they're breaking up into

435
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,839
they're broken up into two different

436
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,459
chat Services

437
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,099
um jabber and Rocket as you can tell

438
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,619
jabber is a much bigger chat and then

439
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,059
there's kind of they're broken up time

440
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:19,740
wise the jabber chat is broken up into

441
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,359
two separate groups um there was some

442
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,400
infiltration and issues that they had

443
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,520
around the between 20 end of 2020 and

444
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,820
the beginning of 2021 so

445
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,460
um what's hilarious so if you if those

446
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,020
techies probably know wait how are we

447
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,520
reading their chats didn't they use

448
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,620
encryption no they did not almost

449
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,080
entirely I found one single message out

450
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,799
of the 107 108 000 messages in the

451
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,299
earlier jabber group

452
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,640
um that was encrypted they used it more

453
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,520
frequently in the second um group

454
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,660
um

455
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,220
and so but and 254 members well I

456
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,120
probably missed a few there's probably

457
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,100
more than that but with hundreds of

458
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,539
members they're not Conti's not that big

459
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,340
you'll see it in the slide they're like

460
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,960
less than 100 people so they're not

461
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,240
they're not practicing as as you know

462
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,340
Elite hacker ransomware hacker group

463
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,020
they're not practicing very good cyber

464
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,460
hygiene they're not encrypting their

465
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,200
messages and there doesn't appear to

466
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,760
like they're kicking off old members

467
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
which might have contributed to uh the

468
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,220
leaks okay so I tried to do some

469
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,780
analysis on

470
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,160
um man you guys are going to want to

471
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,140
move closer if you want to see if you're

472
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,580
interested in the receipts that I have

473
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,320
so um

474
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,299
I tried to do some analysis on what the

475
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,620
difference is between the rocket chat

476
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,880
and jabber

477
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,700
um and it more work is needed there guys

478
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,980
because no reporting I haven't seen any

479
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,660
reporting trying to diff really explain

480
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,059
that I found like one sentence

481
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,559
um I thought I was getting somewhere

482
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,600
when I found this example actually a lot

483
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,160
of the companies mentioned the targets

484
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,900
mentioned in the chats there actually

485
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,760
isn't very much overlap

486
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,000
um between jabber and Rocket I found one

487
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,100
and it was where the the company was

488
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,600
mentioned and then a few like a week

489
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,799
later

490
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,480
um it was mentioned in jabber so I'm

491
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,220
like oh cool that says something well I

492
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,020
found a counter example the other

493
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,340
example I found was the company was

494
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,080
mentioned jabber and then weeks later as

495
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,039
mentioned in

496
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,500
um rocket chat my theory looking at the

497
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,120
information is that there's a lot more

498
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,700
like mimikats commands and and more

499
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,220
credentials it appears to me there's my

500
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,600
I didn't quantify it but appears to me

501
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,220
there's more credentials in rocket so

502
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,140
looked if I was to guess I would say

503
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,200
that rocket or the rocket chat is and

504
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,700
the members in there are more focused on

505
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,100
the privilege escalation and the initial

506
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,020
lateral movement in the net in their

507
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,120
target Networks

508
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,220
um

509
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,799
and so yeah if you want uh you can find

510
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,539
you can download the files and help me

511
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,039
with this analysis

512
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,960
um part of the reason why I'm not as

513
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,220
prepared as I would have liked to be is

514
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,360
because I was up till three in the

515
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,640
morning Thursday night um finding some

516
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,140
really cool stuff that I couldn't share

517
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,880
in this presentation I I thought I

518
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,880
should vet it through the FBI first so

519
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,200
um there's still more work to be done

520
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,280
and that's where I kind of thinking it's

521
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,299
kind of fun I'm going to correct the

522
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,160
record on a few things this is some

523
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,860
tools they use they've got uh PHP uh

524
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,200
framework tools you might recognize

525
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
um oceans they they do use uh there is

526
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
indication that they're paying for the

527
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,039
premium oscent tools

528
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,900
and then some exploit tools I'm not

529
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,940
including all of them but uh Cobalt

530
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,799
strike and and supporting modules are

531
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,980
the big ones um and Mimi cats

532
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,900
um signal higher if you don't know I

533
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,240
believe the last two uh signal higher

534
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,120
and crunch base uh are probably being

535
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
used to get um like the personal emails

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,220
and phone numbers of like Executives to

537
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,539
kind of put on the heat during

538
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,480
negotiation Zoom info is the one that is

539
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,059
most easiest to see in the jabber chats

540
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,620
they're sharing zoom into the links like

541
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,559
crazy just as a profile to provide a

542
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,440
profile of their targets

543
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,539
um and then of course I didn't I I it's

544
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,500
almost embarrassing I didn't include

545
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,960
this for those who know um it's the oh

546
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,820
trickbot trickbot they're kind of is

547
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,100
they're kind of their call sign

548
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,020
um for it's a banking Trojan that they

549
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,660
use and then um the locker of course to

550
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
encrypt and decrypt their victims

551
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,559
information

552
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,340
um

553
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,919
here's the receipts if you're sitting

554
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,539
close enough you can see it talks about

555
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,400
getting the premium the buying Showdown

556
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,820
and and Signal higher and zoom info

557
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,820
um for their new ocean department so

558
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,500
they they it's kind of a formal

559
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,960
operation they got going in fact uh this

560
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,760
was not really in detail I never saw

561
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,380
this reported anywhere else

562
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,480
um this is um they talk about the teens

563
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,679
but I thought it was interesting to look

564
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:29,820
at how much they're actually paying

565
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,020
their guys

566
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,299
um you can see the main team is the

567
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,360
biggest total like I said under 181 at

568
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,340
this time and

569
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,659
um how much they're getting paid I broke

570
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,880
it out on averages if you look per

571
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,140
person the ocean team is actually

572
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,700
getting paid the most more than the

573
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,559
reverse Engineers that probably pisses

574
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,559
some people in this room off but

575
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,159
um

576
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,840
it could be because it's their senior

577
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,460
leaders maybe are taking care of some of

578
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,140
that oh sent but um it kind of

579
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,419
highlights that how maybe how much value

580
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,620
they put into the the ocent legwork of

581
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,600
prioritizing their targets fun fact I

582
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,240
looked up that 1800 this is US Dollars

583
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,159
I'll talk a little more about linguists

584
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,659
I had Russian linguists confirm that

585
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,520
this is not rubles here

586
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,080
um 1800 which that would be really

587
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,900
horrible 1800 rubles 1800 average uh

588
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,880
monthly comes out to about top 15

589
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,500
percent of wage earners in Russia

590
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,080
there's some complaints amongst team

591
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,280
Conti team members that they're not

592
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,080
getting paid enough but that's that's

593
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,120
not bad

594
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,120
um here's the receipts too small to see

595
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,700
if uh unless you're really close but

596
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,500
uh what's the date on that uh I think

597
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,559
it's June 2021 so they could be paying

598
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,539
their guys more now who knows

599
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,460
all right so targets I use the word

600
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,559
targets intentionally not victims

601
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,659
because while I can see a list of bunch

602
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,419
of companies it's not easy to confirm

603
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,340
um how many of them actually experience

604
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,620
I tried reaching out to a few of them

605
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,900
and they wouldn't return my calls

606
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,299
um one of them I think a high executive

607
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,400
at one of them uh probably learned that

608
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,840
he shouldn't put his cell phone number

609
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,020
in uh his away message uh uh his out of

610
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,940
office message so yeah I left a

611
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,039
voicemail didn't hear anything back but

612
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,100
um

613
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,500
some people are really sketchy about

614
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,419
that uh I just like reference my

615
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,919
military background and hope that they

616
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,200
don't think I'm nefarious or something

617
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,059
um so anyways multiple people have

618
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,500
reported that

619
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,020
um they are seeking victims that have a

620
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,640
hundred million dollar annual revenue or

621
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,460
more I kind of think that my respect to

622
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,380
Krebs and and this great team here that

623
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,260
did some good announce on it uh I think

624
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,700
it's uh dangerously misleading it

625
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,559
provides a false sense of security to

626
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,240
companies go oh we're not even close to

627
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,500
100 million so we don't have to worry

628
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,480
about ransomware well I think part of

629
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,039
the reason why some people might have

630
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,500
overlooked this is like I said I have as

631
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,820
a former linguist I have some pretty

632
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,620
good hookups with some really talented

633
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,380
Russian linguists and I kept on noticing

634
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,720
rhubarb come up in places where I don't

635
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,559
think they should be talking about

636
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,440
rhubarb and um so I had my Russian

637
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,299
linguist friends look at it and

638
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,640
that Russian word while it translates to

639
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,380
rhubarb it's what we would call a loan

640
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,299
word if you say if you push the Google

641
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:10,679
translate you know listen to what it

642
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,260
says it sounds like new that was my best

643
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,360
Russian accent I could I guess but

644
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,299
um so um those two uh messages there

645
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,860
indicate that they're actually on paper

646
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,380
they're targeting 50 million annual

647
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,020
revenue or more even uh more interesting

648
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,940
is of all the companies that are that

649
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,940
listed via Zoom info links the minimum

650
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,380
went all the way down to one million

651
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,419
annual revenue the top was 12 billion

652
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,960
the median was less than 75 million

653
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,860
um

654
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,140
I confirmed eight companies using their

655
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,720
leaked site uh their onion Leaf site I

656
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,340
confirmed eight companies that were both

657
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,440
in their chat logs and

658
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,780
um did experience you know based on that

659
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,120
leaks I did it were victims and the

660
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,480
lowest one had a public publicly known

661
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,960
um annual revenue of 11 million okay so

662
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,179
you have 15 million you think oh we're

663
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,799
just a real estate office or just this

664
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,659
or that you know that's not high risk

665
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,700
well Conti is the most prolific and

666
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,559
they're willing to go after 11 million

667
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,820
there's other ransomware groups that

668
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,520
will probably go after less so

669
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,840
um something important to keep in mind

670
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
uh

671
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,659
[Music]

672
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,460
all right so forescout did some great

673
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,200
analysis that I didn't want to um you

674
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,820
know reinvent the wheel

675
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,500
um they call them victims I think

676
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,720
they're probably just mean targets that

677
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,760
were referenced in the chats but you can

678
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,080
see there the biggest chunk is actually

679
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,440
medium not large companies and mind you

680
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,559
to consider Conti is the highest

681
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,559
grossing ransomware in 2021 both in

682
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,960
number of victims and earnings uh what

683
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,559
and what what what's reported so um yeah

684
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,659
and and even small companies are have a

685
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,120
healthy representation there sectors

686
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,500
sector breakdown Services were first

687
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,440
then manufacturing and then retail shoot

688
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,840
I have like 10 minutes okay

689
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,299
let's look at revenue and ransoms

690
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,919
um

691
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,980
it's been reported it other people are

692
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,419
reporting that they kind of their

693
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,460
initial Ransom demand is based off of a

694
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,559
percentage of their annual revenue but I

695
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,760
didn't see anyone reporting the revenue

696
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,980
that what that percentage was so I

697
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,659
thought it was useful information

698
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,220
um for people who are managing their

699
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,799
Ransom uh you know trying to quantify

700
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,179
that's a big thing that companies do in

701
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,440
risk assessment they want to quantify

702
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,000
the risk well there it is what's your

703
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,380
annual revenue they're going to

704
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,880
initially demand or at least Conti is

705
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,900
going to initially to demand around

706
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,000
three percent give or take but as that

707
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,500
top um

708
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,559
message if you can see they say well um

709
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,380
ask for I think it's 4 million ask for 4

710
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,720
million but um so that we pick up at

711
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,059
least two so they understand that

712
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,679
they're probably gonna they're willing

713
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,299
to negotiate to about half of what their

714
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:43,980
initial demand is

715
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,480
um that's actually a little more

716
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,580
aggressive than average according to uh

717
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,039
unit 42's data they indicate the average

718
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,820
Ransom demand is 2.2 million and the

719
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,279
average uh payout is about a quarter of

720
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,679
that so um Conti's a little bit maybe

721
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,500
more aggressive um and you see that one

722
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,419
time someone offered like 18 Bitcoins

723
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,640
and like oh they just swore up the storm

724
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,460
they were so so insulted that they went

725
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,600
through all that work and they're only

726
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,159
offering 18 Bitcoin which was like I

727
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,020
don't know 30 000 at the time at that

728
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,520
time or something like that

729
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,179
um

730
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,580
no maybe 300 000 that's probably low huh

731
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,720
anyways

732
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,220
um

733
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,960
all right so now we start getting to

734
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,460
motivation I thought it would be

735
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,260
interesting to look at to understand

736
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,120
though I see numbers in the chats but

737
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,580
how do I contextualize it so I uh

738
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,679
analytically so I thought it'd be

739
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,020
interesting to use gross output data

740
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,860
um

741
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,039
to kind of uh as an indication of the

742
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,440
the Deep pocketed sectors how much money

743
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,559
is flowing through a given sector and

744
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,299
um when you look at that wow actually it

745
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,039
kind of lines up manufacturing is first

746
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,779
in both with Transportation food and

747
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,520
beverage kind of neck and neck behind

748
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,279
manufacturing maybe manufacturing is a

749
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,559
little bit disproportionate so you have

750
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,000
to remember that they're not just

751
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,299
interested in and successfully

752
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,000
um rants uh deploying ransomware on a

753
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,400
deep pocketed victim they also want to

754
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,520
secure of the ransom payment right so

755
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,380
that's another thing in particular when

756
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,299
you're working manufacturing

757
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,580
um you know every hour every dollar that

758
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,679
production is offline they've they know

759
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,380
how much money they're losing every hour

760
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,840
um so there's that additional pressure

761
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,580
where they they already know how much

762
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,200
every hour is worth

763
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,000
um easily and

764
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,880
um that may be uh that be maybe on top

765
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,580
of as far as ICS sectors go on top of

766
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,500
the being deep pocketed

767
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,880
you know that that's an additional

768
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,400
pressure that may be increasing the um

769
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,679
disproportionate targeting okay all

770
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,880
sectors it gets a little bit more

771
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,820
interesting uh with unit 42 uh data and

772
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,159
uh the Department of Commerce data

773
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,159
um notice that construction

774
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,080
uh is relatively not that deep pocketed

775
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,940
compared to other sectors but it's

776
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,539
number two as a ransomware Target sector

777
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,059
um so you have to consider well

778
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,980
um that's where maybe vulnerability is

779
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,600
playing a bigger part there as a sector

780
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,860
they're more vulnerable and maybe

781
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,960
they're more willing to do a quick and

782
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,360
easy payout to get back to work

783
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,900
um conversely if we look at uh state and

784
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,279
local government

785
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,740
sector

786
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,460
um

787
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,860
they seem to be kind of uh under

788
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,620
targeted based on if you alone look at

789
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,700
their um uh you know rev or output by

790
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,880
sector and I think the key to this is

791
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,279
2019 does anyone remember let's try to

792
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,360
get some audience I like participation

793
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,100
does anyone remember what happened here

794
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,880
in Texas in 2019 relevant to ransomware

795
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,820
no

796
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,679
uh coordinated ransomware arrival

797
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,080
ransomware attack targeting uh impacting

798
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,779
22 Texas municipalities I might have

799
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,240
recognized that um when I said it but

800
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,020
um how many of them paid the ransom

801
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,120
zero big fat whopping zero pay the rent

802
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,399
well at least that's what they reported

803
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,700
um so uh and then that was in May of

804
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,100
2019 and then in August

805
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,679
uh another big city got hit bigger than

806
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,419
the little Texas

807
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,820
Country Bumpkin towns um

808
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,360
the uh it was Baltimore Baltimore got

809
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,200
hit with uh Robin Hood uh ransomware and

810
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,940
um I was actually living in the area at

811
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,140
the time and I didn't take public

812
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,360
transit but they it really impacted

813
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,000
their operations and their Ransom was

814
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,279
seventy six thousand dollars

815
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,460
and they refuse to pay

816
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,980
um the estimated damage and and I think

817
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,919
went into the millions and um but they

818
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,720
took a principled step it's funny it's

819
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,100
funny how governments seem a little bit

820
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,919
more willing to um to tolerate the suck

821
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,720
on principle

822
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,419
um so

823
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:51,960
um they uh but to their credit it

824
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,820
appears to be working for them as a

825
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,179
sector that ransomware victims kind of

826
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,399
have maybe gotten the idea that state

827
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,960
and local governments are more likely to

828
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,179
follow FBI guidance and refusing to pay

829
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,100
a ransom and it's benefiting the sector

830
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,980
so I'm totally sympathetic I'm I'm

831
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,539
totally sympathetic to the for-profit

832
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,520
companies that are looking are in the

833
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,200
situation and they say well

834
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
um you know it's best for our customers

835
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,140
it's best for our stakeholders our

836
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,600
investors that we just pay the ransom

837
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,100
um but maybe there's some innovative

838
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,260
solutions that we can think of that

839
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,840
would encourage uh companies to to

840
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,840
refuse ransoms ransoms more

841
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
um I'm thinking sisa might be able I I

842
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,580
maybe private sector Solutions too you

843
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,500
know through industry um collaboration

844
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,440
ways to incentivize companies to benefit

845
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,020
the whole sector anyways

846
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,760
um just a thought

847
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,460
so motivation

848
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,340
they obviously they're financially

849
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,260
motivated attackers that's what I I

850
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,000
reference that phrase often in my risk

851
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,559
assessments financially motivated

852
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,240
attackers they're motivated by getting

853
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,860
that money but even then there's some

854
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,659
Nuance there it's not like I said before

855
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,059
it's not just go chasing after the

856
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,399
highest dollars it's a it's there's a

857
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,279
it's a function how how much might I get

858
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,020
based on their revenue but also how

859
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,659
willing are they to pay fun fact since I

860
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,820
have the time

861
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,260
um they uh of the eight companies that I

862
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,679
confirmed uh two of them

863
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,919
were uh multi-billion dollar annual

864
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,559
revenue and I'm protecting their

865
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,720
identity if you haven't noticed

866
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,080
um but one of them refused to pay

867
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,480
I don't know I I reached out that was

868
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,740
one of the companies I reached out to I

869
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,440
wanted to know and well I should say

870
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,360
based on the fact that zero or a hundred

871
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,919
percent of their data was released on

872
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,779
their league site I'm assessing that

873
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,360
they they refuse to pay and I kind of

874
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,880
wanted to find out why with Thelma how

875
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,380
much how much they I wanted to know did

876
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,659
maybe they reduce it to two percent or

877
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,360
you know uh with that high of a ransom

878
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,200
anyways so that's my presentation

879
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,779
um thank you again for the b-sides for

880
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,760
this opportunity and I'm able to take

881
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,740
some questions for the next five ten

882
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,760
minutes

883
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,720
if anyone has any

884
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,340
yes is there I think we have a

885
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,200
microphone here so everyone might get

886
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,610
picked up on the recording as well

887
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,519
[Music]

888
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,320
do you think that uh companies

889
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,539
willingness to pay and government's lack

890
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,460
of willingness to pay is maybe related

891
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,980
to insurance that companies may have

892
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,559
that maybe governments don't have a way

893
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,299
to purchase or haven't figured out how

894
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,860
to purchase

895
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,480
it could be

896
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,460
um the CH I didn't dig that deep into

897
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,380
the insurance chats but it has been

898
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,120
reported that they they definitely were

899
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,799
interested in who had insurance that

900
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,059
would just kind of do a more easy

901
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,039
insurance payment so yeah that's a

902
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:48,080
really good point I don't have insight

903
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,000
you you believe that governments aren't

904
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,700
buying cyber insurance I I guess they I

905
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,659
guess they aren't right they're like

906
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,640
they're who's gonna I don't know I uh

907
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,320
that's a good point I I'd be interested

908
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,640
to do you know do you have some insight

909
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,559
into whether or not they they are are

910
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,260
not buying insurance

911
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,399
I don't but I know that one of the

912
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,320
complications is of course like who are

913
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,359
we paying this money to who would our

914
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,460
insurance pay this money to a government

915
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,639
might be hell is more held easily

916
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,040
accountable if they pay money to North

917
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,199
Korean hackers

918
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,339
um especially when you don't know who

919
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:21,899
you're dealing with and a company can

920
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,399
kind of hide behind lawyers with

921
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,918
insurance I really don't know that's a

922
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,960
that's some deep Insight no I really

923
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,760
appreciate that I kind of agree with

924
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,280
your initial assessment that um the kind

925
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,379
of the additional complexities of of a

926
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,060
government I mean I think that probably

927
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,379
comes in line more with the federal

928
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,020
government than than state and local

929
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,099
municipalities but

930
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:43,619
um fun facts uh that brings up an

931
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,300
interesting point is that um there's

932
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,879
some reference I forget if the outlet

933
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,679
was named but there's reference to a

934
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,139
journalist that was helping them kind of

935
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,940
broker negotiations I thought that was

936
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,300
kind of uh interesting I if I was a tech

937
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,500
journalist I don't think I would put

938
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,040
myself in that position but uh they also

939
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,240
said they have connections there are

940
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,460
also some indications that they're um

941
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,119
they are tied closely to the Russian

942
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,280
government they were it appeared that

943
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,280
they were tasked to look up I'm not a

944
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,740
Korea you know Asia is my kind of area

945
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,300
of responsibility when I was linguist

946
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,920
but to look up

947
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,099
um I forget his name some big Target of

948
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:26,520
uh that Putin Putin enemy that they were

949
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,599
responsible for kind of getting

950
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,180
information on so

951
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,740
there that that tie to like you said

952
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,540
that tie to nefarious governments that's

953
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,339
a good concern definitely to think about

954
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,560
when when paying a ransom

955
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,940
um any other questions

956
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,800
yeah

957
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,079
[Music]

958
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,480
great talk I have a question about one

959
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,240
of the insights which is the medium uh

960
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,619
size companies are actually one of the

961
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,020
largest targets do you have any thoughts

962
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,700
or ideas as to why

963
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,960
um they would go after those the more

964
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,660
after than the big companies I would

965
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,700
expect big companies be the majority of

966
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,140
the targets

967
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,660
um I would suspect okay so one thing I

968
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,160
forgot to mention that that reminds me

969
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,720
in the tools section is that what was

970
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,339
conspicuously missing from the tools

971
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:09,720
that they used

972
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,900
um are initial access tools

973
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,180
um so it is I agree with the assessment

974
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,119
that it looks like they're using

975
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,900
um access Brokers so that could be

976
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,000
um at play is that maybe it should you

977
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,280
know they they aren't organically

978
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,440
generating their targets really they

979
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,060
they are starting with maybe access

980
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,920
Brokers and so uh maybe there's more

981
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,940
medium-sized companies than the larger

982
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,140
ones that they're getting initial access

983
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,540
to maybe the larger ones have the budget

984
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,579
to kind of do some of that take care of

985
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,680
the low-hanging fruit type stuff

986
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,660
um and so yeah I suspect It's a

987
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,060
combination of just uh what what they

988
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,660
have access to and um the number of

989
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,160
companies right there's there's you

990
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,720
start to get that density like I talked

991
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,980
about gets more when you get to

992
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,079
medium-sized companies good question

993
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,920
thank you yeah

994
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,280
Wiley

995
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,280
do a line next time

996
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,359
how's it going early at the beginning

997
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,339
you had a slide that showed Conti lock a

998
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:15,480
bit all the different like ransomware

999
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,560
groups are you able to talk a little bit

1000
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,000
about like how that attribution is done

1001
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,740
how easy or hard it is it looks like you

1002
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,300
kind of got kind of got lucky getting

1003
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,220
that dump of of content on Twitter is it

1004
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,959
usually that easier is a lot harder

1005
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,980
um good question

1006
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,060
um you know

1007
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,400
threat activity attribution is is a

1008
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,740
really sticky monster as I understand it

1009
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,359
um you're looking closely at the ttps

1010
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,520
but attribution with ransomware gets

1011
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,079
pretty easy because

1012
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,660
um of their they basically of of who's

1013
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,579
who they're paying for the rant who's

1014
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,560
you know they kind of try they can uh

1015
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,720
see what the wallets are that they want

1016
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,880
to send Bitcoin to and the The Ransom

1017
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,740
note is usually distinct they're not

1018
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,079
usually hiding and then and then they've

1019
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,040
got

1020
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,140
um the league sites right a lot of unit

1021
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,960
42 oh sorry wrong slide a lot of unit 40

1022
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,579
42's data

1023
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,140
um if you see where was it

1024
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,060
uh is come on the left there is coming

1025
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,240
from uh League site data so they're

1026
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,859
they're it's it's pretty easy to

1027
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,260
attribute when they say you know pay us

1028
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,880
Conti

1029
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,460
um but uh so I don't think attribution

1030
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,680
is too big of a concern here even if you

1031
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,240
don't have the Insight um I don't know

1032
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,380
if they say like you know send money to

1033
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,880
the Bitcoin address or something yeah

1034
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,500
yeah the ransomware were typically give

1035
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,820
instructions so and they'll have

1036
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,460
contacts like I said they kind of run as

1037
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,800
somewhat a formal operation like oh let

1038
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,420
me uh pass you to our customer care oh

1039
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,859

00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,720
right so there I I uh fortunate I guess

1044
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,400
fortunately you can say ransomware isn't

1045
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,079
as difficult as other type of

1046
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,880
exploitation activity

1047
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,680
maybe one or two more questions thank

1048
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,759
you one more question

1049
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,960
