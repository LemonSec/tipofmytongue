1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,799
i have been

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,160
in the intelligence field for roughly 20

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,800
years

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,759
the majority of that was in the public

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,679
sector so military intelligence and

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,279
intelligence service

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,119
you might be surprised to see me here at

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,439
this conference because i do not have

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,960
the strong technical background that

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,640
many of the other speakers have

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,359
and many of the attendees have i am more

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,439
an intelligence analyst so i get that

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,359
information that is derived through

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,440
different assets and then i try to come

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,640
to conclusions

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,960
based on that information and that's

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
kind of what i want to show you

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,040
in today's presentation although i must

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,719
say i can't really relate to

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,320
what grant just showed because my

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,840
background in intelligence was in

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,440
signals intelligence

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,920
so seeing that again was really nice

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,600
because that's something that i would

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
look into in the past if i

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,440
am not working on my nine to five job

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,000
you can

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
find me on twitter for example you can

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
find me on my blog and i'm just really

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,959
passionate about the whole topic of open

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
source intelligence investigations

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,920
and intelligence in general

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,680
so for today i would like to look into

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
social media intelligence sockment and

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
how you can use this and leverage this

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
in your threat intelligence environment

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
and for today's example i do not want to

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,000
have a very theoretical

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,759
presentation i want to show you

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,759
something more or less practical

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,520
and i will be showing this in the

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
example of iranian threat actors

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
and how they actually act or what we can

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,920
get from their

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
social media profiles so for some of you

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
these terms ocean sockment um maybe

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,399
something that you know of

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,880
um for some of you it might be new so

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,200
therefore just a brief introduction

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
into what i will be talking about in

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,799
general

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
now open source intelligence or osint is

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,520
basically the collection

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,159
and most importantly the analysis of

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,640
data obtained from public sources

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
public sources is basically just

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,318
googling things for example

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,038
but it could also include paid sources

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,440
or

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,599
sources where you have to log on so

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
something that we would also refer to

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
as the deep web and of course in certain

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,840
situations

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,000
you might be diving into the dark web

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
but most of the things done

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
in ocean are kind of staying in the

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
surface and deep web

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
ocean will also conta can include

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,440
certain subtypes

70
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,840
such as something termed as social media

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,959
intelligence

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,519
sockment which is basically looking into

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,360
social media platforms

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
uh such as the larger ones as facebook

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,360
linkedin twitter

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
but maybe also regional social media

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,720
platforms

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,959
for example the contact which is kind of

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,480
a russian facebook

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
or in today's example looking into

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,400
current and old

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,120
iranian social media platforms but also

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,879
a lot of the other stuff that is popping

84
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,760
up on the scene

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,040
such as instagram tick tock and so much

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,519
more now just not to leave it out but

87
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,840
not as relevant for today's uh

88
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
presentation is geospatial intelligence

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,920
geo-end which does kind of combine with

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
ocean because we're looking into

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,599
publicly available maps and satellite

92
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,480
imagery

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
and last but not least what leads us

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
here today

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
is threat intelligence where many of you

96
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,519
utilize

97
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,200
some of the tools that are out there

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,879
either free or paid

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,239
such as census showdown risk iq virus

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,879
total and so much more so whenever you

101
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,720
go to these platforms and you pull

102
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
information from them

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,120
technically that is open source

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
intelligence

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,519
now we're going to look into certain

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,040
individuals today

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
that may or may not be linked to certain

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
apts

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,439
the only reason that we really find

110
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
information on them

111
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,400
is a very very simple thing that people

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
often make mistakes people are not aware

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,200
of their operational security

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,080
or they don't care or they're just dumb

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
so when i used to work

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,439
in the intelligence service we would

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,840
always say that intelligence relies on

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
mistakes our adversaries make

119
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
or basically there are dumb people out

120
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
there that might not even know they're

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,238
dumb

122
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,720
and they make these mistakes and that is

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
the reason that with

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
social media intelligence we are allowed

125
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
to collect a lot of information

126
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,199
a lot of detailed information on

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,240
individuals

128
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
and i will show you today how some of

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
that information that at first

130
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
might not be so relevant for your threat

131
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
intelligence scenario

132
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,639
could actually be the missing piece in

133
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,479
the puzzle

134
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
so before we really dive into this

135
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,919
example

136
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,000
just a couple words beforehand

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,520
we're going to talk about the

138
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,160
methodology that you can use to track

139
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
threat

140
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
actors with ocean and specifically with

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
social media intelligence sockment so

142
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,000
going into

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,280
profiles personal profiles of these

144
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,199
individuals now this can be considered

145
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
borderline boxing i do not want to make

146
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,080
a very theoretical

147
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,840
presentation that just shows you the

148
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,080
even individual steps i wanted to back

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,039
this up with

150
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
real life data so today in this

151
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,800
presentation

152
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,479
you will be seeing real life

153
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,880
data you will be seeing certain names of

154
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
individuals

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
but of course i did not pick an example

156
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,360
from a

157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,680
current investigation i did not pick an

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
example

159
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,039
of an investigation which is more or

160
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,320
less sensitive

161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,039
i chose individuals i chose a group that

162
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,400
has been reported on

163
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
previous times or numerous times

164
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,759
in the past so a lot of what you will

165
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,960
see today

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,240
is data that is derived from official

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
reporting if i can call it that way from

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
such organizations as

169
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,479
fireeye and i will be adding my own

170
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
research to that when it comes into

171
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,120
social media intelligence and if the

172
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,080
individuals have

173
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
not been broadly reported on i have

174
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,479
redacted their information

175
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,840
in this presentation another thing that

176
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
we have to keep in mind

177
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,560
when it comes to this type of work

178
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,120
is that the threat actor attribution and

179
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
the subsequent research

180
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,240
on this can easily be manipulated by

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,960
planting

182
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,199
false flags so our adversaries are very

183
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,400
well aware

184
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,479
that certain individuals are doing

185
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,759
research on them

186
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,000
so if they are smart they might plant

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,199
false flags

188
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,960
or on the other hand if we are looking

189
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
into a certain apt

190
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,440
they might also already in their cyber

191
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
attacks in their malware

192
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
plant these false flags that lead us to

193
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,560
the wrong

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,919
track so those are the basics of today

195
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,560
and now let's just dive in to this

196
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,919
practical example

197
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,319
to show you how we can leverage the

198
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,199
information

199
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,160
found in social media accounts and use

200
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,800
that to

201
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,759
attribute things and find out which

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,960
individuals may

203
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,759
or may not be high be behind certain

204
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,840
cyber attacks

205
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,639
now in this example i have chosen apt-33

206
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,440
a well-known iranian-backed or

207
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,639
iranian-based

208
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,960
group that has been causing lots of

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
ruckus over the past

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840
couple years now when i look at

211
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,280
something like this

212
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,120
my focus is on people my focus is not on

213
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
the technology my focus is not on the

214
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,440
i.t

215
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,000
infrastructure that was used to perform

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,919
such an attack

217
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,039
and therefore i'm on the right end of

218
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,639
this spectrum

219
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,199
so for a lot of you attending this

220
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
conference today

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
you'll probably be on the left side of

222
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,319
this slide a slide

223
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
looking into the modus apparently the

224
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,479
techniques that were used the technology

225
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
that were used so basically summarizing

226
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:00,960
this

227
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,240
under defer i personally go to the right

228
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
end of this spectrum

229
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,560
and look at the human behind the machine

230
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,680
behind

231
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,720
most attacks there is a group and in

232
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
that group there are individuals

233
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,039
and these individuals they have certain

234
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,240
reasons for doing

235
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,479
what they do they have a certain

236
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,800
motivation behind this this could be a

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,960
financial motivation this could be

238
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,560
a political motivation state-sponsored

239
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
groups

240
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,320
so combining all this information from

241
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,200
what you get

242
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
out of your basically reverse

243
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
engineering of malware you're

244
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,440
tracking the it infrastructure used for

245
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
such an attack

246
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,120
and then me looking at the ocean and

247
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,200
sockman side of that who is actually

248
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
behind this

249
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
you can combine this to perform a proper

250
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
risk analysis and really figure out why

251
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,399
this did happen so moving further

252
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
to the human behind the machine what are

253
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,880
the things that we can

254
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,480
find and how might these be relevant

255
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
well at first we're looking for mr x

256
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,160
we're looking for an

257
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,440
unknown individual and even

258
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
within the code of malware or within the

259
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,279
information that is obtained by a difer

260
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
you might find things that could be

261
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
useful to identify the individual

262
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
for example a nickname or even the

263
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,040
language

264
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
settings that are used these language

265
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
settings might lead

266
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
to the origin of this group or this

267
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,720
individual

268
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,120
and moving on from there using those

269
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,000
basically as

270
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,279
pivot points in investigations we can

271
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,120
find further selectors

272
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,360
i'm sorry this is an old second term i

273
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,640
use so

274
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
phone numbers email addresses usernames

275
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,560
or any type of data that will enable us

276
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
to identify an individual

277
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
and to pivot off this data point to find

278
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,200
further information now if we have

279
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
gotten so far as that we have identified

280
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,839
an

281
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,800
individual we might be able to identify

282
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
certain affiliations

283
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,440
who does this person align with or

284
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,120
certain associates who is this person

285
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,640
actually linked to

286
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,360
also maybe the motivation behind this

287
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
why did this attack happen

288
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,640
why is this specific person mad at a

289
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
certain company or wants to obtain

290
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
certain information from a company or

291
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
government why did they perform

292
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
this attack and also very interesting

293
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
depending on how good the opsec of these

294
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,880
individuals is

295
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,519
they might leave traces to previous

296
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,640
activities

297
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
so seeing the history of a certain

298
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,240
threat actor

299
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,640
might enable us to figure out how good

300
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
this person is

301
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,399
which technical skills this person has

302
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,360
and might help

303
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
figure out if they are actually capable

304
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
of performing such an attack

305
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,040
or not so going back to

306
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,040
apt 33 well why are they such a nuisance

307
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,079
here you see three examples of

308
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
media and press reporting over the past

309
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,120
two years

310
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,959
where apt 33 was mentioned

311
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,200
in the context of attacking industrial

312
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
control systems

313
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,160
a campaign that targeted european energy

314
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,040
companies

315
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
another campaign that targeted

316
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,160
high-profile

317
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,680
conference attendees so a broad variety

318
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,560
of basically cyber attacks either

319
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,360
against a specific machine or device

320
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,240
in the top two headlines or specific

321
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,279
individuals

322
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
and the bottom one would probably be to

323
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
obtain information

324
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,839
from these individuals so

325
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,320
this is what starts it off and this is

326
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
the moment where basically a deferred

327
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,959
team

328
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,880
starts investigating where did this

329
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,079
attack come from

330
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,320
what exploits are they using what

331
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
malware how are they infiltrating a

332
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,040
system

333
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,519
and there's a lot that can be done there

334
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,279
but that's not my job

335
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,440
like i said i do not have that strong

336
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,880
i.t background

337
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
but basically in combination with a d4

338
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,240
team

339
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,680
that's the moment where you can take an

340
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
intelligence analyst with ocean or

341
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,959
sockment skills

342
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,760
and send them out to research additional

343
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,480
information

344
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,360
so let's start off with an example and

345
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,880
like i said i chose a

346
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,680
public example so a lot of what you will

347
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
be seeing here and especially the

348
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
starting point

349
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,279
is not my own investigation it is not my

350
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,240
own work

351
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,279
i contribute this for example to fireeye

352
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,480
to the reporting there

353
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
and at the end of this presentation i

354
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,120
also have some of the links

355
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,399
that i used to dive into this topic

356
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,440
so when it comes to apt33 there was a

357
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,079
very

358
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,880
lengthy and interesting report from

359
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
fireeye that said

360
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,040
they found they looked into the malware

361
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,320
and within there

362
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
they found a turned up back door which

363
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,519
basically had

364
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
this little bit of code in there if i

365
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,040
may call it that

366
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,839
um referencing to a certain user account

367
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,920
named x-man fix as a 1365

368
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,839
x so this could be something that can be

369
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,399
used for ocean or sockment

370
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,920
investigations

371
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,959
and of course this was also done by the

372
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,959
people that put the report together

373
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,040
so they basically went out to google

374
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,160
taking this

375
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
fairly unique username and found that

376
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,320
this username

377
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,440
was used among many different iranian

378
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,079
software

379
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,680
and programming forums as you can see

380
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,040
here

381
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,199
so if we look to the right basic

382
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
googling nothing fancy here

383
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,560
we see an account x-man 1365-x

384
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,120
it leads to an iranian site by the way

385
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
very interesting 1365 is the iranian

386
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,639
year for i think let me in 1980 or 1981

387
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,160
so again a hint that there might be an

388
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,680
iranian behind this

389
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,120
and we find a profile with a real name

390
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
and we could also get the birthdate out

391
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
of there and things like that so

392
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,040
fairly easy to use going back even

393
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,519
further

394
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,519
in other forums we will come to other

395
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,360
selectors that we can use for our

396
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
research

397
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
so in the middle you see an example from

398
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,519
2008

399
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
that's how far it goes back where this

400
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
user apparently shared his

401
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
email address x-man underscore 1365

402
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,560
underscore x at yahoo.com so again

403
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,880
from an ocean standpoint we can move

404
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
forward with this we now have a name

405
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,279
we have a possible birth date we have an

406
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
extra email address

407
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,920
which can also be utilized in the search

408
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
for social media accounts

409
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,839
and on the left we see another example

410
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,839
of one of those mentioned forums

411
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,839
but in this case you see that the

412
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,839
username has something that looks really

413
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,120
weird at first

414
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,480
this username x-man is actually using

415
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,040
the arabic numbers so that translates to

416
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,360
1365

417
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,519
but a good example that a lot of times

418
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,120
we will be working with

419
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,320
foreign languages and in oceans it is

420
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,399
then very very important to have this

421
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
translated properly now you all know you

422
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,839
can use google

423
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,480
translate or bing translate or dpl or

424
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,839
yandex translate

425
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,560
to get this done but sometimes you will

426
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,519
come across

427
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,079
websites or even documents which you

428
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,320
cannot ocr which you cannot manually

429
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
translate because they're not properly

430
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
ascii coded

431
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,199
so there's just one little unique tip

432
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
that i would like to show you

433
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,040
let's assume we come across a site where

434
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,240
we cannot have this

435
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
automatically translated and we really

436
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
want to know what it says

437
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,600
so something you can use in this case

438
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
is in google translate just drawing

439
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
stuff and i'm not kidding i will show

440
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,959
this in a short video

441
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
you go to google translate select the

442
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
input text then you can hand write this

443
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
works for basically any language

444
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,320
and then you can start drawing stuff

445
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,279
what you see in your document

446
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,759
so let's just let me finish drawing what

447
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,440
i have here

448
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,079
and see what google says afterwards so

449
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,839
just a nice little tip a nice little

450
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,560
technique

451
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
that might be useful for normal ocean

452
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
investigations

453
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,120
google will give me certain results i

454
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
will pick the one that looks the most

455
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
like what i have seen

456
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
and et voila you have my name even

457
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,639
including the proper spelling with two

458
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,120
t's

459
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,959
and an h so so far we're at very very

460
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,920
basic googling very basic google doors

461
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,959
very basic

462
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,040
ocean and we kind of want to move on

463
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
into the realm

464
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
of social media intelligence

465
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,800
so going further with this googling and

466
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,199
this

467
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,079
ocean we will also come across

468
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,199
information like this

469
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,759
if people don't have proper opsec so

470
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,120
here again we see

471
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
excerpts of x-man's activities on

472
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,360
previous iranian hacker and programming

473
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,079
forums

474
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,000
where he basically asks questions or

475
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
displays his skills

476
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,279
now again keep in mind i don't have the

477
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,720
technical background that

478
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,280
you guys do but i'm pretty sure the top

479
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,319
left one

480
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,520
will be something that might be

481
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,439
interesting to you for me

482
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
i do not have the background on that but

483
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,919
if i look in the bottom right

484
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,919
i will see that this person displays

485
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,319
certain skills that he or she has

486
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,319
so certain programming languages that

487
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,520
they're fluent in

488
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,160
from virtual basic to pascal to c plus

489
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
to javascript

490
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,119
and all kinds of things like that so

491
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,679
again this could all be gathered

492
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,480
to figure out if this person is actually

493
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,280
capable

494
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
of performing the cyber attack that we

495
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
started out with

496
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
or how capable they actually are

497
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,760
now the last thing i would like to

498
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,000
discuss before we move into the actual

499
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,679
social media part

500
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,120
is you saw we had an email address so if

501
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
i have an email address

502
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
chances are hi if it's been around for

503
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,320
quite a while

504
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,880
that it has been breached in or in some

505
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,520
kind of breach data somewhere

506
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,200
so looking into this we see x-man 365x

507
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
at yahoo.com

508
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,320
and it has been found in certain leaks

509
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,360
so this leads to another

510
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
bright variety a variety of options that

511
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
all depend on

512
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,720
your individual laws company regulations

513
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,520
and also your ethical standpoint

514
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,320
so from this breach data which you can

515
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
also maybe even find the actual data

516
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,240
somewhere on the dark web or obtain that

517
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
somewhere on the surface web in certain

518
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,799
forums

519
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,720
you might be able to find out more

520
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,840
information

521
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,320
names maybe even a bank account other

522
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,200
user names

523
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,280
other selectors just a whole bunch of

524
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,600
stuff but the question is always

525
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,000
are you allowed to use this is it

526
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,760
ethical to use this that's not something

527
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
i'm going to answer

528
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,679
today but if you have access to this

529
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,799
information again

530
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,880
in most cases it will provide a pivot

531
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
point let's just say x-men had a very

532
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,120
very unique password

533
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,799
of course that would also enable us to

534
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
look up this password and breach data

535
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,720
and might lead to further accounts

536
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,799
and with further accounts i mean also

537
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
maybe even further social media accounts

538
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,640
where this crate these credentials were

539
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,280
actually

540
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,480
used so moving away from

541
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
ocean in general and the possibilities

542
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
there getting to the point where we dive

543
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,440
into

544
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,919
social media and one of the first things

545
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,559
you can do

546
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
in social media is you can try to

547
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,600
identify

548
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,760
affiliations you can try to identify

549
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
people that are linked

550
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,240
to this individual so we started off

551
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,120
with x-man

552
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,160
and we found out his real name

553
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,720
and we started looking into social media

554
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
platforms and we come across a linkedin

555
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,679
profile

556
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,679
which could or could not be this

557
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,720
individual

558
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,559
here's a guy named mariju narvar he's

559
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
apparently an engineer and if you go

560
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,240
into the details you'll see it's a

561
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,840
software engineer and he's located in

562
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
iran

563
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
but he only has two connections and this

564
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
seems like a dead end because he doesn't

565
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,320
use this profile

566
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,160
the same thing could be done with the

567
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,559
previous iranian forums in which he was

568
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,120
in

569
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,000
trying to find individuals and get data

570
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
from them

571
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,880
often we will also again rely on

572
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,320
leaks data and for this specific example

573
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
i would like to show you how this was

574
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
used to further the investigations

575
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
so down here is something that was

576
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,880
basically

577
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,039
a leaked data set and this has happened

578
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,919
in iran

579
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,760
in the past a couple times that on

580
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,679
telegram for example in certain groups

581
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,720
or on certain

582
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,080
message boards data was linked on

583
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,760
these threat actors on x-man 1365

584
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,520
and in one of those documents we have

585
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
the information oh yeah this guy

586
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,840
he's also linked to another dude named

587
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,440
gladiator cracker

588
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,919
and there's of course more information

589
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:48,799
in there

590
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,240
so moving into this we find

591
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
further friends buddies affiliations

592
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
that we can look into

593
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,440
now for the sake of this demonstration

594
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
let's just take

595
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,720
gladiator cracker and see what google

596
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,919
comes up with

597
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,400
as basically the first step in our

598
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
investigations

599
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
and it is very easy because this again

600
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,159
is a unique

601
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,799
handle a unique username which

602
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,120
immediately or almost immediately leads

603
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,679
us to a site like this for example

604
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,480
where we have a username gladiator

605
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
underscore crt

606
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,039
crk aka gladiator cracker

607
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,919
and that is also aligned to a real name

608
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,840
which is nima nikju

609
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
and looking into this we see certain

610
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,320
videos to kill kaspersky internet

611
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,559
security to bypass a resp

612
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,960
a v-stream sandbox image to bypass

613
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,480
cuckoo sandbox

614
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,280
so lots of things that will or can be

615
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,559
coming from the realm of

616
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,520
penetration testing or malicious

617
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
activities

618
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
now moving forward with this name you

619
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
know it's just following the breadcrumbs

620
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,600
we also come across a youtube channel

621
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,320
where we have

622
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,000
similar videos of people or of a person

623
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,679
uploading exploits and things like that

624
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,280
now this could help to attribute

625
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
a certain cyber attack if we know this

626
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,120
person is somehow affiliated and these

627
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,600
were technique techniques that were used

628
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
um to you know put those puzzle pieces

629
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,960
together

630
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
but on the other hand why does this

631
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,159
person

632
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,480
do not does not have any upset why are

633
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,840
they posting all this why are they

634
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
putting all this information out

635
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,080
it doesn't really make sense in the case

636
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
of iranian hackers

637
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
it could be that they just don't care

638
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,280
because they're untouchable in their

639
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,799
home country

640
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,640
or maybe the other option is they're not

641
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
behind it who knows remember the whole

642
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,559
false flag discussion

643
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,520
so what this could look like is a video

644
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,960
like this

645
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,440
let me just start this and in here you

646
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
see there is an email address

647
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,559
so again if this wouldn't have been part

648
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,039
of the

649
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,760
text in a web page you would have been

650
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,880
able to derive

651
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,039
some kind of information out of this

652
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,840
video and another thing that we see here

653
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,880
would be how this person does certain

654
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,760
techniques

655
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,159
certain skills that this person has

656
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,159
maybe even the hardware or software

657
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,480
setup that this person is using

658
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,240
so watching something like this will

659
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,480
lead to a lot of new insight

660
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,000
when working in threat intelligence

661
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
now i don't want to bore you with the

662
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,280
complete video you can just

663
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,000
move a bit further with this video and

664
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,960
you will actually

665
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,000
see that there are certain things that

666
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,840
are performed certain uh

667
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,720
steps that is really a nice manual on

668
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,799
how to use this exploit

669
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,720
and also keep in mind this is quite old

670
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,240
so i'm pretty sure that this has been

671
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,960
patched

672
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,799
in the meantime so again it all

673
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,799
comes down to identifying individuals

674
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,960
identifying skills identifying

675
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,240
affiliations and something very

676
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
interesting that is basic

677
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,320
googling

678
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,000
now this individual who for some reason

679
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,720
we have

680
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,240
linked to the apt-33 group through this

681
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,520
original

682
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,559
leak that was put out there also has

683
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,080
social media profiles and if you look at

684
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,919
the social media profile of this

685
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,039
individual

686
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,799
um there are some things that are very

687
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,799
interesting so this is a recent view

688
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,559
now he says he's based in ankara in

689
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,880
turkey it used to be iran and he also

690
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
explained at a certain time he has to

691
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
leave his beloved motherland but at the

692
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
same time he says oh yeah i'm a security

693
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,559
consultant i'm into threat intelligence

694
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,159
i'm a malware analyst

695
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,799
and so on and so forth so what we also

696
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,080
have to keep in mind

697
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,320
is that people here actually know what

698
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,840
they are doing and what they are talking

699
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,799
about

700
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,039
and here we can see an example from this

701
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,720
profile in the past

702
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,559
um where he mentioned that he worked for

703
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,640
the cabocho security center

704
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,400
according to a lot of the reporting

705
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,679
firearm reporting

706
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,640
and recorded future reporting this

707
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,320
organization this company

708
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,799
is linked to the iranian government and

709
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,559
participates in malicious

710
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,880
activities now if you take a look at

711
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
this profile

712
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,760
right now you will see that now he says

713
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
i work for the sapar security lab

714
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
so the question for me as an analyst is

715
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,240
is why did this change

716
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,679
why did he make this change everything

717
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,679
else is the same malware analysis

718
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,480
software

719
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,559
system programmer or security researcher

720
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,080
then he lists the things that he does

721
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,880
the time span

722
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,520
is the same so maybe the company got a

723
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,400
new name

724
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
or maybe this is also an attempt to hide

725
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
certain tracks but a very bad attempt as

726
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,679
well

727
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,760
but just little details like this little

728
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,799
things like this

729
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,320
will lead to questions that an

730
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,240
intelligence analyst should ask

731
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
and then you write those down and try to

732
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,279
find the answer

733
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,760
for this so if we know this person is

734
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
online

735
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,400
maybe because they have no feeling of

736
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,440
upset maybe because they're innocent

737
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,240
maybe because they just don't care we

738
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,600
can also look into their

739
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,400
activities our dear friend here um

740
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
gladiator cracker

741
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,240
also known as nema he also has twitter

742
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,520
profiles

743
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,880
and on twitter on linkedin many people

744
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
actually express their personal opinions

745
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,559
so you can kind of profile them and try

746
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,679
to figure out

747
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,240
what is their political in alignment

748
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,840
what do they think about

749
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
how do they feel about certain issues

750
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,200
and that at the end

751
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,559
could lead to an actual motivation

752
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,840
for a certain cyber attack so if we look

753
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
into this guy's twitter for example

754
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,760
we'll see there was a certain tweet that

755
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
he was not happy about

756
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,240
the chinese ambassador said something

757
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,200
and he said well you're

758
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,960
a freaking idiot you know next time

759
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,559
inform yourself before you open your

760
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,520
mouth

761
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,279
so if there is any activity from the

762
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,080
apt-33 group

763
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,799
against anything chinese and this fits

764
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,679
the timeline

765
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,679
we could have a certain motivation here

766
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,760
that he and his buddies are angry about

767
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,960
something that the

768
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,400
chinese politician here is talking about

769
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
the other thing on the bottom right um

770
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,840
nima a while back

771
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,440
shared information that he was kind of

772
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,600
locked out of his github account

773
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,039
now your github account has been

774
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,279
restricted due to u.s trade control law

775
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,559
restrictions

776
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,120
so again if we have an attack sometime

777
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,840
after that

778
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,919
against github microsoft or something

779
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,200
like that this

780
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,159
could be an indicator for the motive of

781
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,320
such malicious activities

782
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,520
but again it could it doesn't have to we

783
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,200
will actually have to find

784
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,679
hard evidence and hard proof for this

785
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,919
and unless he doesn't say yep it was me

786
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,600
and i did it with my buddies

787
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,399
that is very hard to prove but looking

788
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,559
into this factor which is not

789
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,279
that technical on the contrary that

790
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,000
might lead

791
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,880
to information that will help you in

792
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,320
threat intelligence

793
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,799
figure out if these people are or are

794
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,080
not linked

795
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,640
to these attacks what you will see a lot

796
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,360
of times

797
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,279
when looking into these iranian-based

798
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,399
threat actors or

799
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,480
hackers they don't like their own

800
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,679
government either

801
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,000
a lot of times they will go on rants on

802
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
social media about their own government

803
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,799
so again this could be an indicator that

804
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,320
they might not be linked to the

805
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,279
government

806
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,200
but at the same time i worked for the

807
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
government long enough and every once in

808
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,559
a while i would also say this is just

809
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,440
messed up

810
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,600
so that doesn't have to be hard evidence

811
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,480
and proof

812
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,320
that they are not in fact working for

813
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,840
the government

814
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,080
so moving forward i start looking at

815
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,200
nema's buddies

816
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,480
because from what i've seen so far he

817
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,720
is more or less linked to the original

818
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,840
apt there

819
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,120
a 33 hacker he is involved in a lot of

820
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,039
reverse engineering pen testing and

821
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,880
things like that so the next step would

822
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,039
just be to see you know who else

823
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,360
is linked to these guys is there anyone

824
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,520
else that is interesting

825
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,760
so in that case i'm looking into this

826
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,640
profile

827
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,880
and i come across a tweet where he

828
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,880
shares a picture of this guy

829
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,399
and that tweet actually mentions

830
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,159
something like oh gosh i hope you'll get

831
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,679
released soon

832
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,080
um you know so that is you know just

833
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,600
something i keep in my mind

834
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,360
and then i look at this person and see

835
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,520
that they not only follow each other on

836
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,559
twitter

837
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,720
but they also regularly interact

838
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,799
especially this guy named iman

839
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,600
emperor who always reacts to tweets

840
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,279
regarding pen testing reverse

841
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,320
engineering

842
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
and that tells me well he's probably

843
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,919
into this topic as well

844
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,919
and i know that they know each other in

845
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,840
real life because i have a picture of

846
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,799
both of them

847
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,200
together so you know slowly moving

848
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,399
forward i have a guy

849
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,840
where i can say they know each other in

850
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,320
real life and this other guy is also

851
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,600
heavily interested in these hacking and

852
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:37,919
pen

853
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
testing activities so that would be just

854
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,360
another person i would look into

855
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,799
the reason that the picture is very

856
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,640
interesting is it is

857
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,399
really solid proof that they have met

858
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,000
each other in real life

859
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,320
uh for a lot of osun investigations like

860
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,600
if you were to look at my twitter

861
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,880
account i have a couple thousand

862
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,799
followers i maybe know 25 of those in

863
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:57,679
real life

864
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,200
so if someone wants to look into that

865
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880
and make assumptions on who i am linked

866
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,840
to or not

867
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,520
that doesn't really work unless you find

868
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
my face smiling next to another face

869
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,480
in one picture so based off this and

870
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,760
based off the fact that this

871
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,440
iman guy is interested in similar topics

872
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,520
i chose to look into this person as well

873
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,399
so i moved forward i took this guy

874
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,440
looked at him

875
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,360
and next to what i found on twitter i

876
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
also found a facebook account for

877
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,480
example

878
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,159
um that uses this handle iman emperor

879
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:30,880
which is

880
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,520
very unique in my opinion and i get to a

881
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,880
real name

882
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,760
so now we're moving basically from sock

883
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,159
mints to osint again define this

884
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,200
and back to sockment now let's have a

885
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,120
look at the emperor

886
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,679
what this guy is all about well first of

887
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,440
all you look into his twitter

888
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,120
and there's a lot of activity on there

889
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,960
as well and a couple of things that i'll

890
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,399
point out in a second

891
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,279
um since we're working with a foreign

892
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,960
country or people with a foreign

893
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
background

894
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,960
i also find old iranian social media

895
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,559
that's out there as well might not be

896
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,320
used as much but there are things like

897
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,720
face nama or club

898
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,360
where you would find iranian citizens so

899
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,279
here again i can go back into the past

900
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,000
and i can get

901
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,279
additional information on this guy names

902
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,320
his history affiliations birth date a

903
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
lot of stuff that might be relevant

904
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,880
to me in the future and because it's

905
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,440
apparently a cool thing to do nowadays

906
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,519
go on linkedin and set up a profile

907
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,000
there and immediately i here see

908
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
that this guy lists he is a pen tester

909
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,679
at the kavos

910
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,399
security center so next to the fact that

911
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:38,720
i

912
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,440
know that this dude and the other guy

913
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,000
nima

914
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,120
know each other in real life i also now

915
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,399
know that they

916
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,880
worked at the same company and if this

917
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
company is somehow linked

918
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,200
to uh state affiliated or state

919
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,000
organized

920
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,799
malicious activities um we could also

921
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,080
assume that

922
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,640
uh amir aka the emperor might also be

923
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,679
involved

924
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,000
also very interesting i find out on

925
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,960
twitter that he

926
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,279
was in jail so he was imprisoned by the

927
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,799
iranian authorities

928
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,360
for doing some hacking there and i also

929
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,000
find out

930
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,840
that he claims to be a pen tester at

931
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,480
emperor team so emperor team i'm like so

932
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,159
what what is this what is this about is

933
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,519
this a company

934
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,000
and we can move on from here and use

935
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,679
this as a search term

936
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,399
so again now looking into this knowing

937
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,440
that this person

938
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,880
might be affiliated with state-sponsored

939
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,399
hacking activities but then

940
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,600
reading through his timeline and

941
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,120
figuring out he was imprisoned for

942
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,440
hacking activities in his company

943
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,039
makes me think well what's wrong with

944
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,720
this what does he work for the

945
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,919
government does he not work for the

946
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,279
government why would he work for the

947
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,640
government if imprisoned

948
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,559
many many questions out there not all

949
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,840
that can be answered

950
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
but just to give you an example of how

951
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,080
complex this all is

952
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,120
so going further into his social media

953
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
um we find things like this from january

954
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,440
2021 where someone said tell me you're a

955
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,880
hacker without telling me you're a

956
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,840
hacker

957
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,480
and he just goes emperor team as if we

958
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
were to

959
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,159
we were supposed to know what this is

960
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,279
and who this is

961
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,960
and here with another more or less

962
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,519
unique spelling which could be

963
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,320
a further point of investigations using

964
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,960
ocean

965
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,640
and or sockment now also looking into

966
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,760
iman's activities we cut stumble upon

967
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,720
a very old paste bin where he basically

968
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,200
shared

969
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,399
certain uh scripts or codes for things

970
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,679
that we he would do

971
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,880
he would also also actually share data

972
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,600
breaches

973
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,279
so hey we're the emperor team and we

974
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,120
hacked this and this iranian server and

975
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,440
here's all their personal data

976
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,919
so once more we might have someone that

977
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:48,640
is working

978
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,559
against foreign adversaries um

979
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
you know iranian a point of view but he

980
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
also does some mean stuff within his own

981
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,360
country

982
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
which probably got him arrested in the

983
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,360
first place and on the other side

984
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,240
you will just see other examples um

985
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,600
where you have

986
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,919
bits and snippets of code that he shared

987
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,280
to do certain things

988
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,480
sql injection and things like that and

989
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
also at the same time we get

990
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
to a email address iman.emperor

991
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,119
gmail.com which we could use for

992
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,000
further investigations and since he is

993
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,320
very proud of his work this young man

994
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,079
he also shares things on linkedin

995
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,320
stating oh yeah that was me that was me

996
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,280
and my crew

997
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,159
back in january 21 he posted this and

998
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,800
this was a hack or a defacing of a

999
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,839
website

1000
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,159
many many years back done by the emperor

1001
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,079
team and in specific

1002
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,879
these people so we're kind of getting a

1003
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,599
network

1004
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,119
of iranian hackers by them

1005
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,079
disclosing information on social media

1006
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,440
so to kind of summarize all this

1007
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,079
we started out with apt 33.

1008
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,200
we looked into the reports that came

1009
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,599
from

1010
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,240
fireeye where a lot of the technical

1011
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,400
analysis the reverse engineering was

1012
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,200
done

1013
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,480
we picked up on the super awesome ocean

1014
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,200
analysis

1015
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,920
that fireeye did finding certain

1016
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
individuals and their backgrounds

1017
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,119
and we took it a bit further to find

1018
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,000
more on this whole network of

1019
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,680
individuals

1020
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,200
so x-man was linked to apt33

1021
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,359
through that little snippet you saw

1022
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,800
where he basically

1023
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,839
uh used windows with the username

1024
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,680
x-man 36-1365 underscore

1025
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,119
x further information that was leaked

1026
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,240
for example

1027
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,200
led to the combination or the link

1028
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,680
between

1029
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,200
x-men and gladiator and apt-33

1030
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,079
and moving on from gladiator we got to

1031
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,960
iman

1032
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,240
who we know is in real life linked to

1033
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
this gladiator guy they have met

1034
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,320
they know each other and we have a

1035
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,480
pretty good overview of their private

1036
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,280
life

1037
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,240
so if we look into this we actually see

1038
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
lots of personal data up to the point

1039
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,680
where you can get their car

1040
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
and license plate number thinking one of

1041
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,520
these examples that didn't show it but

1042
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,640
we had that as well

1043
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,359
and iman linked to his hacking crew

1044
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,400
emperor team

1045
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,800
with other individuals and a lot of

1046
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,560
these other individuals will have a

1047
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,920
similar footprint

1048
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,119
online enabling you to figure out what

1049
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,800
are their capabilities

1050
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
what is their past so their history in

1051
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,160
this

1052
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,079
and of course lots of personal data

1053
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,079
the personal data again for me is

1054
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,920
relevant as a

1055
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,079
intel analyst that does not do the

1056
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,440
technical research

1057
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,040
but just as pivot points for potential

1058
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,240
social media

1059
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,599
research or ocean research and

1060
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,079
for you ladies and gentlemen that have a

1061
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,000
more or less technical background

1062
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,480
and are really into threat intelligence

1063
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,119
looking into what all these guys do

1064
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,040
you can see their skills and the

1065
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
techniques they might use you might have

1066
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,200
indications on the hardware and software

1067
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,480
they use the it

1068
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,440
infrastructure or things like profiles

1069
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,920
and passwords which also might be

1070
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,680
useful so to summarize all this

1071
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
this is not bad for just a bit of

1072
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,200
googling and browsing through

1073
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,240
social media now

1074
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,680
the final question is in this little

1075
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,800
exercise where i am very much borderline

1076
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,079
doxing these individuals are they

1077
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,200
actually really involved in this

1078
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,640
are these actually the guys that are

1079
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,599
really into apt 33 apt-34

1080
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,800
muddy water and whatever well

1081
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,720
even though they don't really care about

1082
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
opsec that much

1083
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,800
they are aware of what is going on

1084
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,000
around them

1085
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,480
so let me just show you the response of

1086
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,440
nema

1087
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,839
he goes out on twitter and says hey am i

1088
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,960
really responsible for muddy water apt33

1089
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,839
malware

1090
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
and then he goes on a rant about apt

1091
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
muddy water and says yeah

1092
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,000
the stuff you use is crap you know

1093
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
that's not that good and i know my stuff

1094
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,119
because i am

1095
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,240
a a malware analyst and i know what i'm

1096
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
talking about

1097
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,920
so the question is is he part of this

1098
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,280
organization

1099
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,800
is he part of this apt is it a false

1100
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,920
flag

1101
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,720
well who knows that's not a question

1102
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,640
that i'm going to answer

1103
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,359
but this again just shows you the

1104
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,040
problems that we have

1105
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,320
when working in this environment

1106
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
so ladies and gentlemen that sums up my

1107
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,400
short and brief introduction into the

1108
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
possibilities of ocean

1109
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,440
and especially sockment in

1110
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,760
threat intelligence now this will not

1111
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,839
work in each and every country and it

1112
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,520
always depends on how much starting

1113
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,359
points you have and how much information

1114
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,320
you could find on

1115
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,280
individuals it might be different in

1116
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,079
russia

1117
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,839
it will definitely be different if you

1118
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,240
look into north korean activities

1119
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,119
but the basic methodology is just

1120
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,200
following the breadcrumbs

1121
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,240
so the key takeaways for this talk

1122
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,520
ocean and specifically sockment may shed

1123
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,079
light

1124
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,280
on the background of threat actors given

1125
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,040
you have a good starting point

1126
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,880
and given this starting point is not a

1127
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
false flag

1128
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,040
the information that you can collect may

1129
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,280
include but is not limited to

1130
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,960
the overall motivation are they

1131
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,280
generally speaking pissed off about some

1132
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,960
other government or company and might

1133
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,640
attack that governor company

1134
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,800
because they are angry or are they doing

1135
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,839
this because

1136
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,400
it has been tasked to them by their own

1137
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,520
government

1138
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,440
there could be financial motives

1139
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,359
involved the guy we saw amir hussein

1140
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,560
he lives a more or less jet set life if

1141
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,800
you put it in contrast to other iranians

1142
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,839
traveling a lot showing off what he has

1143
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,560
so again that might be something that

1144
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,040
could

1145
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,200
lead to a motive and of course their

1146
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,400
general convictions

1147
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,960
and beliefs it might give you

1148
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,680
information

1149
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,400
on the career background and or skill

1150
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,280
set

1151
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,640
past activities which could give

1152
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,040
indications on

1153
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,839
future activities and last but not least

1154
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,680
the best part about the whole sockment

1155
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,480
process

1156
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,880
the affiliations with other groups and

1157
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,240
individuals

1158
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,319
the bottom line is you should always try

1159
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,000
to combine and verify

1160
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,119
this information with other assets

1161
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,040
all source intelligence is the best way

1162
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,440
to go ahead never really base your

1163
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,000
assumptions on one type of intelligence

1164
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,240
because as i stated in the beginning and

1165
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,520
many times before

1166
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,680
you have to watch out for false flags

1167
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,880
just to get back to this

1168
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,119
example if someone purposely put x-man

1169
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,280
1365

1170
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,440
underscore x in that little snippet of

1171
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,240
code and x-man wasn't even involved

1172
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,880
this whole investigation i did now would

1173
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,839
be rendered

1174
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,800
useless so here are some of the

1175
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
sources that i used to start this

1176
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,480
investigation

1177
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
very interesting to read about the

1178
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,200
hierarchy lots of things to look into

1179
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,599
and that ladies and gentlemen concludes

1180
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,079
my short talk on the value of sockment

1181
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,240
in threat intelligence if you would like

1182
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,079
to read more about the things that i do

1183
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,800
please do visit my blog

1184
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,800
keyfindings.blog or follow me on twitter

1185
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,560
at

1186
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,880
mwocent and now i think we still have a

1187
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,240
couple minutes left

1188
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,000
should there be any questions

1189
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
perfect mathias that was a very

1190
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,240
interesting uh very interesting talk

1191
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,880
um we had a nice chat going on while you

1192
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,000
were speaking one of the things that

1193
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,839
kept coming up was you know the hacker's

1194
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:50,640
vanity

1195
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,160
you know it's the the human factor

1196
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,000
involved in kind of wanting to be seen

1197
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,480
and wanting attacks attributed to them

1198
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,079
um we're very short in time so there's a

1199
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,280
couple of questions have come in

1200
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,680
um i'll just ask the first one it's

1201
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,359
basically are you struggling to do your

1202
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,280
role with the rise of deep fake

1203
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,640
tech creating false positives uh

1204
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
so not not so much with deep fake at the

1205
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,079
moment because a lot of the people

1206
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,839
we're looking into are actually real

1207
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,520
people but i do think that in general

1208
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,079
that is

1209
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,040
an issue for the future um so if i were

1210
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,319
on the other side

1211
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,720
and i would try to do an operation like

1212
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,640
this i would purposely pulse uh

1213
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,800
place false flags and then looking into

1214
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,480
this technology deep fakes and things

1215
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,760
like that will definitely be something

1216
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,000
that

1217
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,240
i utilize so now i'm giving tips to the

1218
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,520
bad guys

1219
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,160
but at the moment i can't really see it

1220
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,040
that much

1221
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,760
but as technology evolves and it gets

1222
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,119
easier and easier for normal people to

1223
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,480
run on their computers

1224
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,720
um this will definitely be a possibility

1225
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,599
absolutely

1226
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,680
and just one more quickly is how do you

1227
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,200
keep track of all these links

1228
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,839
emails tweets profiles etc as you're

1229
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,880
investigating

1230
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,079
do you use a tool like maltego uh i

1231
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,160
personally don't use multigo not

1232
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,040
as you might use it um to automatically

1233
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,760
grab

1234
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,599
information i personally do everything

1235
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,440
manually unless it exceeds a certain

1236
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
amount that i can do manually

1237
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,680
i would use matego case file to make

1238
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,720
link charts or

1239
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,839
i would use things like draw.io or if

1240
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,520
you go to that website there's a client

1241
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,119
you can download you can mind map your

1242
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,720
things so i'm a big fan of mind mapping

1243
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,000
information like this person is linked

1244
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,800
to this person

1245
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,760
is linked to this person and very old

1246
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,359
school even before i start mind mapping

1247
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,079
on the computer

1248
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,079
i start you know scribbling things on

1249
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,240
notes and post-its and drawing it

1250
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,480
but just mind mapping is what i use to

1251
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,560
get all this information

1252
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,079
together in a structured way at the end

1253
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,200
of the day

1254
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,440
