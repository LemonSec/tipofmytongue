1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,240
um i think that introduction covered the

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,360
ring well so i'm not going to spend too

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,400
much time on

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
this slide uh if anyone wants to contact

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,719
me

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,080
um my twitter's there brains933 email

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,199
address and also

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,240
um if you ping me in them uh

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,400
on the swap card app i'll be about all

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,240
day anyway so

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,119
i have feel free to uh to ping me there

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,960
let's get rid of this

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,840
and just for anyone who has ocd my desk

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,239
is an

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,160
absolute mess so um

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,200
i'm sorry you're just gonna have to deal

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,079
with it unfortunately

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,440
so make myself smaller so this is where

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,480
we're going to be working for the most

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,600
part i'm going to be going through and

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
doing some demos of rf

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,000
attacks usually i try and do these talks

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,320
with

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,239
the expectation of no prior knowledge

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
required i am still going to try and do

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
this but i don't have a lot of time

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,399
to go through and do a preamble of okay

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,000
what's rf what's

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,559
frequency all that stuff and so

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,040
hopefully

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,479
i'll just try and explain things as and

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,400
when i get to them and uh

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,840
again hopefully you don't need to know

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,600
anything to see how these attacks work

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,000
so

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
uh hopefully we'll all be okay uh

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,680
quickly going through what i've got on

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,320
the uh

39
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,360
on the desk this here is the circuit

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
that we're going to be attacking so this

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,439
is our

42
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,560
our victim device effectively

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
and this is just a simple remote control

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
circuit um now i'm using lights

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,640
to demonstrate when a signal goes off

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
and when it doesn't so just in case

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,960
anyone has

48
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,560
any um photo sensitivity issues or any

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,079
issues with flashing lights i'm going to

50
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,439
make sure not to strobe them or do

51
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,880
anything like that but just

52
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,799
i'm using flashing lights just so you're

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,799
aware but whenever i press

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,520
a key fob you can see that i've got red

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:47,920
blue

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,880
green and yellow and each of them

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
corresponds to a different signal

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
so that's the um device that we're going

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
to be abusing

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,680
the kit that i'm actually using um is

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,719
things like this so this

62
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,920
is an rtl sdr this is a software defined

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
radio device little usb device

64
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
you plug into your computer and it lets

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,598
you to view uh

66
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,000
signals and capture them uh something

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,120
like this is what an attacker would

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
typically use because these are quite

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,599
cheap they're about

70
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,040
20 quid or so um to transmit our signals

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
i'm using

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
this it's a hack rf1 an attacker

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,959
typically won't use something like this

74
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,239
just because they're expensive this is

75
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,160
about 100 pounds or so for one of these

76
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,599
and generally an attacker is going to

77
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,519
make these devices throw away

78
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
so um this is type of device is good for

79
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,840
us for testing and tinkering and

80
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,800
breaking things

81
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
an attacker isn't really going to use

82
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,400
something like this typically

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
and they're probably more likely to use

84
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,480
something like this and this is a little

85
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,599
device that i made on um the b-sides

86
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
london badge for a few years ago

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,760
and it's cheap it's throwaway i mean you

88
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
can make about five or six of these

89
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
devices for about 20 pounds it's just an

90
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,080
arduino

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
and a little um transmit module to

92
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
preload these with their attacks

93
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,959
stick them near the device that they

94
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
want to attack and away they go

95
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
this i'm going to talk about a later on

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,000
same with these

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
so the first attack that we're going to

98
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
look at is called a

99
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
replay attack and it it works very much

100
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,519
like it sounds

101
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,480
you capture a signal and you replay it

102
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,599
at a later date

103
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,879
so in this case i would hit that

104
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
and i want to capture that signal and

105
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,319
repeat that action

106
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,280
a a common defense that companies use

107
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,159
whenever they

108
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,280
are um presented with

109
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,720
this device as vulnerable to such an

110
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
attack they they usually give the excuse

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
or the argument no

112
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,440
that's not possible because my device um

113
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
the the communication is encrypted that

114
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
does not help you here

115
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,799
because the way that these devices work

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
especially remote control devices

117
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,640
they have a physical effect in the real

118
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,920
world so

119
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,640
me as the attacker i don't need to see

120
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
what's in the in the packet of

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
information i just need to see the

122
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,239
effect

123
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
so i look using a sdr or similar device

124
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,319
look for the signal and look and see

125
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,840
what it does in the real world so in

126
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,879
this case

127
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
if i look for the signal and hit the

128
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
button i can see

129
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,480
that it turns the red light on that's

130
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,079
all i need to know i don't need to know

131
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,560
what is

132
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
inside that packet of information i just

133
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,478
need to be able to see its results

134
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,079
so let's actually have a look at what

135
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,680
this looks like and for this i'm going

136
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,400
to take away my face

137
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,239
and we will go to

138
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,759
here now hopefully you can still

139
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,680
see the desk okay i just like that up

140
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
yeah there we go so this is a little

141
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,440
tool

142
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,919
called um universal radio hacker

143
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
and it's fantastic for

144
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
people who are wanting to get into

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
fiddling about radios and stuff like

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479
that and attacking things

147
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,240
because it's this is almost like the

148
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,080
equivalent of a script kitty

149
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,600
for radios it's a really simple tool and

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,039
uh it can be um it can be used by anyone

151
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,440
believe me if i can use this anyone can

152
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
and it allows you to capture signals and

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
also replay them

154
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
and also do some analysis but i'm not

155
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
going to cover analysis too much

156
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
now because that that could be a whole

157
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,639
talk in itself

158
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,919
but for this we're going to assume that

159
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,479
this is a simple signal which it is

160
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,039
and we're going to uh take a look at it

161
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,840
at what it looks like

162
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
on the rs spectrum and then we're going

163
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
to replay it but

164
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,400
just before i go to the rs spectrum you

165
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
can see here i've got these labeled blue

166
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,759
green

167
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,440
yellow these are all the signals that

168
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
i've captured um offline

169
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
because i trying to avoid falling victim

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
to the live demo

171
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
demons so i know that these work

172
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,919
and that they're all good so these are

173
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,919
the ones i've saved earlier

174
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,199
but i'm going to show you what it looks

175
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,520
like on the rf spectrum

176
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,800
as to when i'm actually trying to

177
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
capture a signal so

178
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,160
if i get rid of this

179
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,759
there we go and i'll make you a little

180
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,199
bit smaller there

181
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,319
so this is what my sdr is seeing

182
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,240
this is the uh what the radio waves

183
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
around us look like

184
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
um the the fuzzy lines that you're

185
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,720
seeing there at the minute

186
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
that's just background noise that's just

187
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,960
their ambient radiation

188
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,199
and what i would do as an attacker if

189
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,720
i'm looking for a device i would do a

190
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
bit of research on the device to find

191
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,639
out

192
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,039
roughly what frequency it operates on

193
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,039
which is sort of like the address of it

194
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,880
um and this this is all usually well

195
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
documented

196
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
and and for the devices in question this

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,080
little key fob i know that it

198
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
is roughly in the 433 megahertz range

199
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,000
which is quite a common one for remote

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,280
control devices

201
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
and i would watch and wait for the

202
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,440
signal and if i press the button

203
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
you can then see that signal and you can

204
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,199
see that's fairly easy to spot

205
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,639
you know if you're looking for a signal

206
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,400
and you're watching for something

207
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
you'll be able to find that quite quite

208
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
quickly

209
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
now what i can then do is

210
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
see if that signal so you can see down

211
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
here a little uh button hopefully it's

212
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
it's visible and basically it says start

213
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
recording and i just start recording

214
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,639
what i see this gray column here

215
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,160
it'll start grabbing everything that's

216
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,759
in there and then i can take that

217
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,360
um signal analyze it and do whatever i'm

218
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,759
i'm

219
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,039
needing to do with it

220
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,840
now if we go back to this you can also

221
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,599
um capture the signals

222
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,680
in universal radio hacker the reason i'm

223
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,039
not showing you that right now is

224
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,919
because

225
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,080
it's simply for recording purposes it's

226
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
the screen is not the best for

227
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,479
viewing but it works in exactly the same

228
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,199
way

229
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,919
but we want to now look and transmit one

230
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,360
of these signals so we've got here

231
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,479
blue which is here's one i've i've

232
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
captured earlier and if i go to replay

233
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,400
the signal

234
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,599
and i need to choose window capture

235
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,520
hopefully this will there we go

236
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
so this is the window that will appear

237
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,280
here you get a more exploded view of the

238
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,840
actual

239
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
signal that you can see and up here i

240
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
select my device that i want to

241
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
use to transmit in this case i'm using

242
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
the hack rf and

243
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,599
you ask for the frequency that you want

244
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,440
to transmit on so you can replay these

245
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
signals on a different frequency to what

246
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,599
you picked

247
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,319
up on typically you're not going to want

248
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,520
to you're going to want to use the exact

249
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
same frequency

250
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,599
and if i hit start it will then replay

251
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,319
the signal

252
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,599
and what i'm going to do is i'm just

253
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,800
going to make the desk a little bit

254
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,520
bigger

255
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,320
just so that you can see the light going

256
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,560
off

257
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,080
and if i hit run on that

258
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,279
the signal turns on that's it

259
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,000
hit it again and it'll turn it off it's

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440
as simple as that

261
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
it really is um now i mean i slowed that

262
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
down for demonstration purposes but if i

263
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
was an actual attacker one thing to do

264
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,040
that

265
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
you could do that in you know a couple

266
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
of minutes it really doesn't take a long

267
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,920
time to do

268
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,160
and a lot of devices are vulnerable to

269
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,279
this style of attack

270
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
the scariest uh that would be

271
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,800
uh vulnerable is likes of industrial

272
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,040
equipment so jcb's diggers

273
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
likes to them cranes so those uh you

274
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,600
know construction cranes

275
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
and possibly most scary of all i was

276
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
talking to an australian at another

277
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,080
conference

278
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
and he mentioned to me that the

279
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
demolition equipment that they use in

280
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
quarries

281
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,600
is also vulnerable to this style of

282
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,320
attack so an attacker could

283
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
in theory detonate explosives while

284
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,839
their workers still in a mine

285
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,560
if they were that way inclined no

286
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,200
completely

287
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
a dick move and um i don't see any way

288
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
to get any monetary value from that

289
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
but you know there could be industrial

290
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,959
sabotage or just you know a threat

291
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,560
you know give us money or we're going to

292
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,080
blow up your minds or

293
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,560
destroy your building site or things

294
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,600
like that

295
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,640
so um quite scary attacks i think and

296
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,440
also very very um easy to do

297
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,279
they um they can be defended against

298
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,360
and if i get rid of this

299
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,120
they can be defended against and a lot

300
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,640
of people is probably going to have a

301
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,040
device that will defend against this in

302
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,680
your home

303
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
and that is your car keys your car keys

304
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,720
use

305
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,079
a thing called a rolling code and

306
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,200
and that can defeat or at least help

307
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
defeat

308
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,560
this style of attack and if i turn

309
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,680
myself back on we're back to the screen

310
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
so a a rolling code can defeat that and

311
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,279
it basically means that you're sending a

312
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,360
different code within the signal each

313
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,079
time

314
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,480
so whenever i press the key fob here on

315
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,279
this

316
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,880
and press it again it's sending the

317
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
exact same signal there's no difference

318
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,760
between the two

319
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,839
it's just the same code each time a

320
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,839
rolling code there's a pre-shared list

321
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,560
or a pseudo

322
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,800
random number generator between the car

323
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,600
and the

324
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,160
uh car key and so each time you press it

325
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,839
it's a different signal

326
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,079
there is a way to defeat that as well as

327
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,519
with everything there's there's always a

328
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,720
way around it

329
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,480
and it's called a roll jam device i'm

330
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
not going to cover it much here

331
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,959
google it it's a very interesting um

332
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,519
device

333
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,959
and it's basically a way of getting

334
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,800
around rolling codes

335
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
so the next attack we're going to look

336
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
at is

337
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
a replay attack sorry wrong repeater

338
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
attack we just looked at replay attacks

339
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,720
a a repeater attack is

340
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,160
as it sounds you take a signal and you

341
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
repeat it and it's usually done in real

342
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
time it's not a case if you store it and

343
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,800
then use it later

344
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
this type of attack is commonly used to

345
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,200
steal uh keyless entry keyless start

346
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,760
cars

347
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,279
so you might have seen some of these

348
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,040
things where you know they they run a

349
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
device near the start of the

350
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
car and it then transmits

351
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,640
the car key signal to the car the car

352
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,519
opens

353
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
and to show you how easy this is to do i

354
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,959
have a little

355
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,720
demo here anyone who's in that mature

356
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,880
radio i apologize but yes

357
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
i i am using bofangs which are cheap

358
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
chinese radios

359
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,800
and most people in the amateur radio

360
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,680
world hit them

361
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,720
because they're cheap and a bit nasty

362
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,600
but i have two radios here and a little

363
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,639
relay box

364
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,399
in the middle and what this is going to

365
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,680
do is quite simply

366
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,519
one of these is going to receive the

367
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,880
signal and the other one is going to

368
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,079
transmit it

369
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,240
now typically whenever they're doing

370
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,920
this they're going to send and receive

371
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,399
on the same frequency so they're just

372
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,480
trying to amplify the signal

373
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,079
for the purposes of demonstration i'm

374
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,839
going to go back to the radio

375
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,680
and the sdr spectrum that we were

376
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
looking at earlier and i've got them to

377
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,639
transmit on slightly different

378
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,600
frequencies

379
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,839
just so that you can see the the actual

380
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,360
replay effect

381
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
taking place so let's get back to the

382
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
sdr

383
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
there we go okay

384
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,000
oh and uh you're in the screen let's

385
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,760
move you away

386
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,120
all right this is up here in there so

387
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,920
we're back on the sdr spectrum and as

388
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
per usual if i press the key fob you can

389
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
see the signal coming through

390
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,040
now if i turn these radios on

391
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,959
and hopefully don't upset any amateur

392
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,200
radio people in the local area

393
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
and i press the key fob now

394
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
you can see the

395
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,680
signal going also when i'm hitting this

396
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
uh fun thing with electromagnetic

397
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,800
compatibility which is devices

398
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,160
interfering with each other

399
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
something is disconnecting from my

400
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,079
computer when i press this key fob

401
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,839
okay good example of a jamming attack

402
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,200
there this is messing with my computer

403
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,680
somewhat

404
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
so we'll press this too much but you

405
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,360
will see whenever i press and hold this

406
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,320
in

407
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,440
and let go you can see that the signal

408
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,040
is actually being retransmitted here

409
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,160
which is where i've programmed

410
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,720
it to so the original signal happens on

411
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,199
frequency 433.92

412
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,120
give or take and i'm getting it to

413
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,760
retransmit

414
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,600
on 433.1

415
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,199
that's it it's as simple as that you're

416
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
taking a signal

417
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,320
and replaying it and in some cases

418
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
you're amplifying it to give it a bit

419
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,440
more range

420
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,639
again predominantly used to defend or to

421
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,279
steal keyless star keyless entry cars

422
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,000
but

423
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
there are other styles of attacks for

424
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,560
this um and there is also

425
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,279
um legitimate uses for things like this

426
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
so your mobile phone effectively uses

427
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,440
repeaters like this

428
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
and so does a new likes of amateur radio

429
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,279
and things like that you

430
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,839
use a repeater to get a signal to go

431
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,519
somewhere that it typically wouldn't

432
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,279
so there are legitimate reasons for

433
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,639
using things like this but this is

434
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,959
obviously a malicious way of doing it

435
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,720
there are defenses and uh one of which

436
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,600
which i believe tesla have done is that

437
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
they have put in

438
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,199
a sort of two-factor authentication with

439
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,160
the car key

440
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,399
there is a low frequency signal and a

441
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
high frequency signal so the frequency

442
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,959
that we've been looking at at the

443
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,480
minutes high frequency actually it's

444
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,959
it's uhf ultra high frequency

445
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,959
and what they've done is it essentially

446
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,639
waits for the low frequency signal to

447
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,519
come through

448
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,839
before it begins transmitting the high

449
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,519
frequency or the ultra high frequency

450
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,959
signal

451
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,800
again that makes it a bit more difficult

452
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,720
but all it means is that an attacker

453
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,519
needs to have

454
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,000
two transmitters and receivers one for

455
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,839
the low frequency signal one for the

456
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,800
um uhf signal so it makes it a bit more

457
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,399
difficult but it's still not

458
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,800
a uh you know it's not a perfect system

459
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
it just makes it that little bit

460
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,079
more difficult now how we did for time

461
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,639
cool we're good so the last attack that

462
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,320
we're going to look at is a jamming

463
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,279
attack

464
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,519
and a jamming attack i'm sure some of

465
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,959
you might have heard of or know what

466
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,680
that is

467
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,959
you're basically jamming the signal

468
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,440
you're stopping the signal from working

469
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,360
now jammers are illegal in

470
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
almost everywhere to either own or to

471
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,480
use

472
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,279
um the little device that i talked about

473
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,560
i said i would talk about a little bit

474
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,680
later on

475
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
which is this one here let me just show

476
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,360
my desk

477
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,759
this little one here this is a

478
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
commercially bought jammer

479
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,959
okay i do have permission to have this

480
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,560
by the way before anyone starts calling

481
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,279
the fss

482
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,000
fcc i i see not going in the chat i do

483
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
have permission to have this

484
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,759
um i am not going to turn this on

485
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,320
because

486
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,199
this sets off my house alarm and this is

487
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
a good example of why these

488
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,079
devices are illegal and it's because

489
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,360
they're indiscriminate

490
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,680
um if you've ever heard of mines or

491
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,959
grenades being called equal

492
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,399
opportunities killers

493
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,920
a jammer is the same thing it doesn't

494
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
care what signal is on there it will

495
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
jam it and interfere with it another

496
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,759
issue part of the reason why my alarm

497
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,240
system

498
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,759
gets set off is because of a phenomena

499
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,120
called harmonics and

500
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,000
direct pickup don't worry about what

501
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,800
they mean

502
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,880
the the basic gist of that is whenever

503
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
you use a transmitter that isn't well

504
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,320
designed or well filtered

505
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
it will also transmit on other

506
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,079
frequencies so it won't just jam what

507
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,119
you think it will

508
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,520
it'll also bleed over onto other um

509
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,799
ranges and other things so you don't

510
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
know what else you might be jamming

511
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,199
and the direct pickup is just electrical

512
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,720
cables any cable can be an

513
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,160
antenna and a device like this can

514
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,079
cause interference on it and an alarm

515
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,559
system it then triggers it

516
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,199
so that is what a jamming device a

517
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,799
commercial one can look like they can

518
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,559
get a lot bigger

519
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,120
um or a lot smaller there is also um

520
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,039
discriminate jammers so there is the

521
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,360
um get rid of this nut

522
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,679
the way to jam like mobile phone signals

523
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,120
some of you may have heard of the

524
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,160
uh american military around area 51 when

525
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,919
they were doing the area 51 raids or

526
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,679
they were attempting to do the raids

527
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,120
a lot of people started losing signals

528
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
and they noticed drones about and what

529
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,919
they were doing is i believe it's called

530
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,360
a stingray attack

531
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,280
where the um they set up essentially a

532
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,480
mobile phone tour

533
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,039
and they have a predefined list of

534
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,400
devices that they allow

535
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,240
on that tar to communicate

536
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,679
so it's effectively jamming it's

537
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,919
stopping some devices communicating

538
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,440
and letting others through but it's

539
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,760
discriminate it's very targeted

540
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,400
those kind of jamming devices are legal

541
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,840
under the right circumstances but

542
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,039
generally speaking

543
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,480
um most jamming devices are illegal

544
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,320
so for our very last demonstration

545
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
just going to make that a little bit

546
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,840
smaller

547
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,799
ah come on live demos

548
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,000
could do them so hopefully you can still

549
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,360
see the light there

550
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
and as i said jamming devices are

551
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,799
illegal so i can't really demonstrate

552
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,679
one but

553
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,520
if for sake of argument a signal

554
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
magically appeared here

555
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,000
um we could demonstrate what a a jammer

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,440
looked like

557
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,880
now what are the odds of that that's

558
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,280
that's handy so this signal has appeared

559
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
and it is stronger than the signal

560
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
of the key fob so if i start hitting

561
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
this and pressing the button

562
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,520
nothing happens the signal's been

563
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,559
interfered with

564
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,240
if the jamming signal was away like it

565
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
did let's hand it

566
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,640
and i press the signal it now goes on

567
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,240
and goes off

568
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,280
that's it simple as that jamming attacks

569
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,000
like this

570
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
in a cyber security way or in a cyber

571
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,679
security mindset

572
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,960
generally speaking it's not that useful

573
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,520
uh a d auth attack a wi-fi d auth attack

574
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,480
is probably a lot more

575
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
um usable or considered

576
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
but it can be used to actually interfere

577
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,120
with wireless security cameras so if

578
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,400
you've got a wi-fi camera

579
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,679
that is only sending a a stream back to

580
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
a a dock or somewhere else where it's

581
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
recording that it's not recorded luckily

582
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,600
you can actually interfere with that um

583
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,480
camera feed

584
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,960
just by jamming the wi-fi and then it's

585
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,600
useless you've just got a garbled image

586
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
so that is it

587
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,480
a little bit rushed but i think we got

588
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
there in the end and

589
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,200
no uh demons came in

590
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
uh so hopefully that's all good and if i

591
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,400
get back

592
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,520
up this and move myself back over

593
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,400
hide the old picture myself any

594
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,520
questions from that

595
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,039
okay let's see there's any questions

596
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,320
none have come in yet

597
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
there was a that's good i'm fine with

598
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,799
that there was great discussion going on

599
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,960
in the chat though

600
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,360
yeah i seen the spaceballs reference yes

601
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,640
just throw a thing of jam

602
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,240
at it that's it that's all you need to

603
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,720
do uh there's one question actually came

604
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
true

605
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,400
how would you go about analyzing a

606
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,559
signal captured in the wild

607
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,559
i.e is it possible to figure out

608
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,679
protocol type

609
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,360
payload encryption enable etc it is it

610
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,679
is

611
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,760
and um the the little program that i was

612
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,679
using universal radio hacker

613
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,600
uh can can do a lot of that for you it

614
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
does have some automated things to work

615
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,000
out like

616
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,440
it's called modulation and um stuff like

617
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,960
that and you can you cannot you can't

618
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,000
analyze it

619
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,159
uh check youtube there's plenty of

620
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,760
people on there who have done it um to

621
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,799
actually go through and show you

622
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,760
analyzing

623
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,679
uh that would be a good r i think and of

624
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,880
itself

625
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,799
but yes it can be done certainly okay

626
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,360
um actually that question came in from

627
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,039
somebody i met at the sound course hi

628
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,240
pablo um

629
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,360
so another question uh grant

630
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,400
just how good our key fob faraday bikes

631
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,280
bags the sword that you find on amazon

632
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,559
for people like me

633
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,039
who own a portable bus

634
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
i've used a couple that are really not

635
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,400
good um

636
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
it really depends what um what one you

637
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,679
go for but

638
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,720
to be honest your your best bet for

639
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,799
my opinion for securing a device like

640
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,559
that is keep it away from your front

641
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,440
door and windows

642
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
because the the receive devices that

643
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,000
they use are fairly short range and the

644
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,799
frequencies

645
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,200
struggle to get through solid objects

646
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,880
like walls and stuff

647
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,280
so honestly just keep the key upstairs

648
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,960
even you know not beside your front door

649
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,320
that'll help a lot

650
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,280
other than that um something i made a

651
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,600
faraday cage out of recently is a

652
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
the the metal tubs of formula like baby

653
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,840
formula

654
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,080
um one of them put it into a little

655
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,960
ziploc bag

656
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,480
and put it in there they're entirely

657
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,320
metal and they've got a foil cover

658
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,200
they work pretty well

659
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,399
so if you know anyone with kids

660
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,760
we have two more questions so

661
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,799
one is could relay attacks be coupled

662
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,159
with the replay

663
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,159
relay the signal on a different

664
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,679
frequency than the one

665
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,240
seen at the known offset and then

666
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,520
replayed later

667
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,039
this was not look suspicious uh you

668
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,840
could do it depends on

669
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,159
yeah i mean you could do it it depends

670
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,440
on what it is you're trying to attack

671
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,480
because

672
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
um as i said the replay and relay

673
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,679
attacks are sort of used for two

674
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,039
different scenarios one

675
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,720
is in real time to try and get around

676
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
the likes of things that maybe have like

677
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
time clocks or stuff like that to try

678
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,240
and

679
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
stop you from replaying a signal whereas

680
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,320
a replay signal if it's the same signal

681
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,919
each time you can you can just save it

682
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,520
and keep it until

683
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,679
whenever it'll never expire as it were

684
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,120
but yeah you could sort of do a

685
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,918
combination of the two

686
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,640
um we have a few more questions loads of

687
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,679
questions

688
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,039
that's good people were listening then

689
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,720
that's good the next one

690
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,559
is what resources would you recommend

691
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,720
uh for learning more about this sort of

692
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,880
thing

693
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,279
uh youtube to be honest there are plenty

694
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,039
of channels um

695
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,799

696
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,039
look them up after the

697
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,000
thing and i'll put them into the chat um

698
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
but there are plenty of people who know

699
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,640
way more than me

700
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,440
