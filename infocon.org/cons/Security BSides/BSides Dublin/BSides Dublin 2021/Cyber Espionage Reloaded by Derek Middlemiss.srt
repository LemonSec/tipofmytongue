1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,240
what i wanted to talk about today was

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
some research that was done by

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
our um by the checkpoint by the

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
checkpoint research department now

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
what checkpoint research is is obviously

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,000
people know checkpoint for

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
security vendor firewalls and this kind

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,439
of stuff but what we have is a

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,240
completely

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,800
separate department that um that goes

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,279
with

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,519
um hold on a second i just realized i

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,320
haven't um

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,840
shared my screen which is rather

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,679
unfortunate we have a completely

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,960
separate department now it's absolutely

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,239
nothing to do with our day-to-day

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:34,960
business

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,719
doesn't get involved in firewalls or

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,480
coding or anything like that

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,879
they are purely and simply there to try

22
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,719
and figure out threats on the internet

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,280
so

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,480
what they've done is everything from

25
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,000
figuring out how to break into the site

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
using fax machines how to hack into your

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,559
digital cameras but one of the major

28
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,840
things we do

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
is we look at what's out there we try

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
and um identify

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
threat actors so as they have complete

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,719
autonomy

33
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
to go out and do whatever it is that

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,160
they wish to do look at whatever they

35
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,120
wish to look at

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,559
then it gives us the ability to track

37
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
people down that's what i wanted to talk

38
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,280
about today

39
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,799
so i wanted to take you through some uh

40
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,600
some siberia cyber espionage

41
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,520
that we found this was actually kind of

42
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,119
found and rooted out last year

43
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,119
but i still think it's relevant now

44
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,720
although this is um the

45
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,040
largely based around the uh the far east

46
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
i think the

47
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,960
techniques used and what we can

48
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,479
what we can actually get from this is

49
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,320
pertinent across the world indeed this

50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,680
attack is actually moving closer and

51
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,360
closer as well as we see

52
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,960
as we're kind of uh moving through so

53
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
it stands at the moment we're seeing

54
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
lots and lots of attacks against all

55
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,600
sections so certainly

56
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
um government political organizations

57
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,360
have always been a favorite target

58
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
um industry but recently we've seen a

59
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
lot more against education and health

60
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,759
care as well

61
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,000
a lot of it due to the uh the kovind 19

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,920
if a hot hospital is really

63
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
heavily overcrowded then they're more

64
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,799
likely to pay if you've done something

65
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,759
from iran

66
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,000
so uh cyber criminals tend to be an

67
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
opportunistic bunch of the uh

68
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
at the best of times so that's that's a

69
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
really good way that you can actually

70
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,600
leverage what you're doing so we're not

71
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
actually talking about that today

72
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
today we're going with um cyber

73
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,080
espionage

74
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
okay so this is what we're going to talk

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
about we'll have a chat about the

76
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,599
the target we'll look into the infection

77
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
chain uh the infrastructure based around

78
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,319
the

79
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
uh the thres actor uh we'll have a look

80
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,760
at the tools they're using

81
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
how we contribute to them and who's

82
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,599
behind it

83
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,040
the company we're talking about today or

84
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
the threats we're talking about today

85
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
is um is uh nikon so we want to look at

86
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,519
a couple of the tools they use

87
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,680
how they do it some of the um i've been

88
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,200
in this industry as was mentioned quite

89
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
a long time

90
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,879
indeed i did an apprenticeship with the

91
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
texas instruments way way way way back

92
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
so i've been doing this quite a long

93
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,040
time and uh and sadly a lot of the tools

94
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,080
that are used there

95
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
actually haven't changed in the

96
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
interceding years you know things have

97
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,599
pretty much

98
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,319
remained the same and the first in you

99
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
get with any kind of threat you could be

100
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,959
as technical as you like

101
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,640
but if it's not for users doing

102
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,319
something clicking on something

103
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,280
downloading something then you get you

104
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
probably knock them it's going to be

105
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
very very difficult to penetrate an

106
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,120
organization

107
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,760
and this one is um really really

108
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
interesting because we kind of stumbled

109
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,879
across this a little bit we've been

110
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,920
doing some work

111
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,159
for somebody else another another

112
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,280
organization

113
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
and what we found was uh was a malicious

114
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,920
email that was sent from an embassy to

115
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,000
a government and it was that then set us

116
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
on the trail so to figure out

117
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
to have a look at what we're doing so

118
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
what we tried to do with our research

119
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,760
was

120
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
have a look at the threat taxes behind

121
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,879
it and figure out

122
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
um what they were doing and we had to

123
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,560
track back over a period of time

124
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,879
because these um this group was first

125
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,000
came to note with

126
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,599
um in 2015

127
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,959
so how they developed and how they've

128
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,720
kind of hardly moved on

129
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,120
from there

130
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,439
okay so let's have a quick look then at

131
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,599
what uh what countries this um this

132
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,280
group has uh has targeted

133
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319
so if we go way back to 2000 2014 and

134
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,040
15.

135
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
this was where they first came on the

136
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
radar there was a report from kaspersky

137
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
that did it originally

138
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,560
what we can see is they were targeting

139
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,040
vietnam miramar philippines singapore so

140
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
everything over in the

141
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
in the far east however at that point

142
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
most of the the tools that were being

143
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:16,959
used

144
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,880
by this group were considered to be a

145
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,160
pretty low tech

146
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
so uh they weren't considered to be

147
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
advanced and most of it was fairly

148
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
easily uh blocked by

149
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
tools and endpoint security that was

150
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,040
available at that time

151
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
so really um as i say very very low

152
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,639
level came around for a little while

153
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,199
then they

154
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,960
uh then they disappeared until they

155
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,400
reappeared for a while

156
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,240
now what we've seen when we go back and

157
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,800
we track back then we can see in 2016

158
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
rather than disappearing as we thought

159
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,080
they were actually active in ukraine

160
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,840
rush from belalu belarus

161
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
we then saw evidence of a campaign

162
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
against the mongolian public sector in

163
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,479
2020

164
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,320
and then later on the campaign against

165
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
australia indonesia

166
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
and the philippines so what's

167
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,960
interesting about this group is they

168
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,479
actually never went away

169
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,320
what they did was they disappeared they

170
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
went under the radar so we didn't

171
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,520
actually see them working

172
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
however once we found them once we

173
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,440
discovered them and traced back then we

174
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,160
could see

175
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,680
the history of what had been happening

176
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,960
so what happened was our instant

177
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,440
response team was was actually engaged

178
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
by another government in uh in asia for

179
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,720
a completely different

180
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
unconnected incident while we were

181
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,000
looking at that investigation

182
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
um the team was having a look through

183
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,919
the logs and we had a look we found

184
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,080
a malicious email the strange thing

185
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
about this email though being sent

186
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,960
from uh from within the network so

187
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
from um from an embassy abroad to the

188
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,039
actual uh one of the state governments

189
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,400
in uh in australia

190
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,320
so once we saw this and this was how the

191
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
investigation started

192
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
and this would have been um actually in

193
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,720
uh 2020 when we started looking into it

194
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,160
so what we found when we went back was

195
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,080
we found this threat actor who's been

196
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,759
um actively targeting governments in uh

197
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,800
in apac

198
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,759
so um this uh this group were targeting

199
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,039
government sentences they were looking

200
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
at ministries of foreign affairs

201
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
science and technology government-owned

202
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
companies anything to do with the

203
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,759
governments

204
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,000
of the uh of the countries indicated

205
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,199
that's what they were really

206
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,479
uh interested in now um one of the uh

207
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
one of the tactics actually to avoid

208
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,199
um protection was to put a commander

209
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,800
control server actually within

210
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,720
the network so the computers that have

211
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,960
been compromised as part of this ongoing

212
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,680
process

213
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
one of those was turned into a commander

214
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
control server which means the traffic's

215
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,639
never actually leaving the attack

216
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,280
network

217
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
so what that does it gives you a much

218
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
lower scope to be able to find them

219
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
because you've not got the chat

220
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
and the noise out there on the internet

221
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,440
that companies like checkpoint can pick

222
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,919
up

223
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,560
um we can then track down so that did

224
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,319
actually make it uh make it quite

225
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,080
difficult to track them down for a long

226
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,560
time

227
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,080
this was one of the reasons why they

228
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,639
were actually able to

229
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,479
kind of stay under the radar for such a

230
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,240
long period of time

231
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,479
now what we can see here from on from

232
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,240
this slide is we've also seen now the

233
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
list of targets has grown

234
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,520
so it does include places like india and

235
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,120
turkey so

236
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
it's slowly kind of moving westwards um

237
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,759
across so who knows maybe we'll

238
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,560
maybe we'll see more of them sometime

239
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,199
pretty soon

240
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,880
so let's have a look at the infection

241
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
chain uh what this organization did

242
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
uh and how they actually were successful

243
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,440
in uh in breaching these networks

244
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,039
so the goal infection chain like

245
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,840
anything um is to get some form of um

246
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
remote access or remote control since

247
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
the uh the days when i do penetration

248
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,919
testing way before i joined checkpoint

249
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,319
that was what i wanted to do i wanted to

250
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,919
get some form of control

251
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,759
so the best way to do this is you

252
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
deliver a back door

253
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,720
now what we found with this group

254
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,639
there's several ways of

255
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
that they have delivering a back door

256
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,240
but what we've got illustrated here are

257
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,039
kind of

258
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,680
a sort of three of them that we'll focus

259
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,039
on and talk about um

260
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,840
a little bit so from our research we

261
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,639
found that the

262
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,800
back door that was used was um called

263
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
area body

264
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
so um this is basically the name of the

265
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,759
kind of remote actions

266
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,520
uh remote access trojan that opens the

267
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
back door that allows them to connect

268
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
into the network um at will so this is

269
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
what's used to deliver the payload

270
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
now to actually get it there it was that

271
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,520
old uh

272
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,759
old special technique of fishing or

273
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,840
spearfishing depending on how you want

274
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
to call it or what tag you want to give

275
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,080
it

276
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,759
now this is one of the oldest techniques

277
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,199
that that i can remember

278
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,520
i remember years and years and years ago

279
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,039
you know a company called rsa were

280
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,759
penetrated

281
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,080
what did they use spear phishing attack

282
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
because at the end of the day people are

283
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,719
curious

284
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,240
people want to know about things if you

285
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
look at what's in the news and you take

286
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,599
what's in the news and you present it to

287
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,399
somebody

288
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
that makes in a way that makes it look

289
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,920
legitimate then people are going to

290
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,320
click

291
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,560
on these emails and this is always the

292
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,040
first step in the in the infection chain

293
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,959
and it was actually brought home to me

294
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,160
yesterday because

295
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
i was uh i finished my day's work a

296
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
whole bunch of um

297
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
zoom calls as we all seem to do these

298
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
days and uh i've gone downstairs to get

299
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
myself what i thought was

300
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
a well-earned coffee and my my phone

301
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,399
blades i looked at it and it was a text

302
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:06,959
and it said

303
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,360
um you've been um would you like to book

304
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
in for uh for a covered vaccine

305
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,600
tomorrow i thought well that sounds

306
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
about as as fake as it possibly could be

307
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,279
you know why would they be asking me

308
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,800
on a friday if i want to go and have a

309
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
vaccine on a saturday so i nearly

310
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,760
ignored it because you know i know

311
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
there's so many of these scams around

312
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,279
but then i kind of looked at it again

313
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,959
and gave a little click and

314
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,560
went upstairs and spent some time

315
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
researching you know i thought actually

316
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
this looks uh this looks valid and i

317
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
went through and i booked myself

318
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
an appointment but the key thing is

319
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,519
there's so much

320
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,959
kind of junk that comes out it's so

321
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,800
difficult to actually see

322
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
between the quality of the work done by

323
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,720
the attackers and legitimate emails

324
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
it did take me quite some time for me to

325
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
confirm so i was happy

326
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,959
that this was a legitimate uh message

327
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,360
and then i i booked the appointment

328
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
but it does show how difficult it is for

329
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,279
a typical user uh within a network to

330
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,800
actually know or understand

331
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,040
what's malicious and what isn't because

332
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
it's very very hard to do

333
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,079
i had another one recently i had

334
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,160
unfortunately had one of my one of my

335
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,040
dogs passed on and we were looking to uh

336
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,800
to get a puppy now i like really big

337
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,959
dogs i like mastiffs huge great dogs

338
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,120
not many of them around so while i was

339
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
looking i found an advert

340
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
and i kind of looked into it and thought

341
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,640
this looks a little bit dodgy

342
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,399
and the more i looked at it the worse

343
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,160
this advert looked

344
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,920
but what i found was my head was telling

345
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,839
me no come on this is this is this is a

346
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,600
this is this is bad this is a scam you

347
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
know the dog doesn't exist there's stock

348
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,320
pictures on the internet

349
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,360
you know they're saying they've just

350
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,959
been born but these are clearly summer

351
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,320
flowers in the background so that that

352
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,519
can't be the case

353
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
but even though my head was telling me

354
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,959
that my heart was telling me that no i

355
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,640
want the puppy you know

356
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
i want to go and get this so you know i

357
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
consider myself to be a bit of a

358
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
hard-nosed person on this but even i

359
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
kind of felt that tanks you can

360
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,720
see why attacks like fishing and

361
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,760
spearfishing

362
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,399
can be quite as effective and successful

363
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,040
as they

364
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,279
as they are but anyway that small small

365
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,600
diversion um

366
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
aside so focusing on the three um

367
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,240
uh infection methods that you can uh

368
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,600
see on the left-hand side there we just

369
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
bought a couple of them because most of

370
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,680
them were

371
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,920
uh the others were kind of variations on

372
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
a theme

373
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,560
so what happened was was um a document

374
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,720
was uh created so the india

375
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,600
indiansway. that was put on um an email

376
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,959
that was sent out to

377
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
various specific people within the

378
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,720
government organizations

379
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
uh this was what it was called in this

380
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
case it could be anything else whatever

381
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
actually makes it attractive to the

382
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,680
person you're

383
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,079
you're sending it to so they get it

384
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,839
entitled to try and open it

385
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,600
so once that email was uh was opened

386
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
then uh what we had was a weaponized

387
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
exploit in there

388
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
which was called a royal road which

389
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,519
actually was what we've seen before

390
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,360
the chinese organization vicious panda

391
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,200
which was another apt

392
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
uh outfit from slightly earlier in uh

393
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,920
2020 so the beginning of 2020 about a

394
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
year ago now i think it was

395
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
so it was one that we'd seen before it

396
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,279
wasn't uh wasn't necessarily

397
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,560
um a new one from there so once we

398
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
um get that and we get that put in then

399
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,839
what that does

400
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,519
it puts um intel uh dot wl into the word

401
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,800
startup folder

402
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,360
so uh once that's in there then

403
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,160
basically

404
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
every time the uh the person we're

405
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
attacking launches word

406
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
then this dll is going to run and it's

407
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
going to be loaded

408
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,519
so it's not set they're not loading all

409
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
the time as soon as you run word

410
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
then you're going to see this in there

411
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,560
so you're going to see

412
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
exactly what decided to do and some of

413
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,480
the other infection chains we can see

414
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,360
there we had

415
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
um like a zip file that was sent out

416
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
that had legitimate xe

417
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,000
and a weaponized dll loader that came

418
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
with it as well

419
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
uh there was a an xc as well that

420
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,880
attached and side loaded

421
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,600
uh area body and then the the rtf is the

422
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,959
one that we've been we've been talking

423
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,839
about here

424
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,600
so either way what happened was as soon

425
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
as it goes in we connect to the

426
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,880
commander control server then we

427
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,160
download the area

428
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,959
we then um we do some requests from

429
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,480
there we have a look at what we've got

430
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,639
what we can see and then we download our

431
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,120
toolkit to do whatever it is we decide

432
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,959
we wish to do with this uh with this

433
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
particular user

434
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,920
now i mentioned we've seen railroad

435
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,880
before

436
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,680
so this was one that we'd uh we'd seen

437
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,240
before

438
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,399
and in this particular case when it was

439
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,760
used it was used with a

440
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
front end of uh coded 19 on the emails

441
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,600
to try and get people interested now

442
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
this is obviously is extremely

443
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
powerful uh powerful message at the

444
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
moment uh for what i've missed mentioned

445
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
we've got things about uh vaccines you

446
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,519
know we've got uh passports as well

447
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,760
the dark the dynamic itself darwin

448
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
itself is completely saturated

449
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,160
with people offering um you know vaccine

450
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
certificates and vaccines as well

451
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
although quite how you can buy a fisa

452
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,760
vaccine that needs to be stored at minus

453
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,480
70.

454
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
expect to get that and it works is it's

455
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,000
a little bit low on me

456
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,639
and i think my general advice would be

457
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,160
anything out on the downhill if you if

458
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
you buy it probably best to uh

459
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,839
probably best to leave it alone but uh

460
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,079
but certainly kobe 19 is a very very

461
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:08,720
powerful

462
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,279
medium for delivery and it's it's very

463
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,360
easy to say kind of send this email

464
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
to get people to pick it up and to and

465
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,440
to actually yeah to actually use it from

466
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
there

467
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,399
so what we then do is uh what the load

468
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,519
will do we'll communicate with the

469
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,279
commander control server so this is the

470
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,040
uh the commander control server that was

471
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,680
used

472
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,120
in this particular instance and this

473
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,079
basically

474
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,920
is uh owned by the attackers most of

475
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,519
them um out there on the

476
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,120
on the internet somewhere well in this

477
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,639
occasion as well we did find command and

478
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,079
control servers that were

479
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
actually coated on people's sites which

480
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,240
is a slightly disturbing

481
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
disturbing thing so that's how we did it

482
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,399
so that's how the

483
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,240
uh that's how it was uh packed up that

484
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
was how the uh the threat was actually

485
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,760
sent out there but what about the

486
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,279
infrastructure that exists behind it

487
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,519
because

488
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
having a good infrastructure behind what

489
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,639
you're trying to achieve here is really

490
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,600
really important

491
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,040
when you're putting these putting these

492
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,959
attacks together so

493
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,920
when we have a look at the

494
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,600
infrastructure we can see that obviously

495
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,240
they've had

496
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
um a cloud project in there because

497
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
everything was uh was out to uh alibaba

498
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,639
cloud

499
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,560
and then we can the domains themselves

500
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
were registered with uh with godaddy

501
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
which is normally pretty benign i know

502
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
my my wife's a virtual gallery she has

503
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
is also done with

504
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,639
with godaddy and i promise you she's not

505
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,199
attacking

506
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,680
asian governments or at least as far as

507
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,959
i know

508
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,519
so one of the interesting things here we

509
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,079
can see

510
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,600
is that if we look on the uh the right

511
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
hand side what we've got in that in blue

512
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,040
are the domains that are being used and

513
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,120
then in gold we've got the ip addresses

514
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,800
so you can see there from the uh from

515
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
the arrows that we've got

516
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,839
that we've got multiple ip addresses

517
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
being reused across domains

518
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,959
so this is slightly lazy and and is

519
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
from the attacker it's kind of good for

520
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,720
us because what it helps us to do is

521
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,160
this cross-referencing

522
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,240
helps us to build up and confirm the

523
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,680
information that we know

524
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
so the more things that are repeated and

525
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,000
done again again and again and again

526
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,360
the easier it actually is for our

527
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
researchers to be able to track through

528
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
so it gives us a better idea of just how

529
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
big and how broad the um the actual

530
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,000
threat

531
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,040
is so taking a look to try and better

532
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,839
understand

533
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,759
um how the attackers operated their

534
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,279
infrastructure over the years what we've

535
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,560
done is we've taken the

536
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,720
malicious domains on the left-hand side

537
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,000
we've got

538
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
the year across the bottom and then

539
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,639
we've had a look

540
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,839
and we've we've mapped uh the the asms

541
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,360
and the autonomous system numbers

542
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,040
um across there now when we look um

543
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,839
over on the left hand side over here

544
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,199
then what we can see is that a couple of

545
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,560
demands there that have actually been up

546
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,079
since 2016.

547
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,680
so they've been up and working for a

548
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
long period of time but also as well if

549
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
you're further to the right

550
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
they're actually still there available

551
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,959
and running at the moment

552
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,279
so some of the infrastructure is new and

553
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,079
expanded

554
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,680
but some of the infrastructure there has

555
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,759
been there for a long time which kind of

556
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,360
uh kind of hints just how long they've

557
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,399
been there they've been potentially

558
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,199
active in

559
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,559
in some of the networks that they're

560
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,000
actually in so if we don't move across

561
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,760
2019 then we can see we've actually

562
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,959
concentrated

563
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,439
most of the infrastructure has gone down

564
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,359
to the autonomous system number

565
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,119
45102 which is actually located on

566
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,559
alibaba so that's from the previous

567
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,199
slide

568
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,640
that's how we can say with some

569
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
confidence that the uh

570
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,000
that the infrastructure is cloud-based

571
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,599
and uh the cloud of choice

572
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,960
is um alibaba so one of the more

573
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,000
interesting observations

574
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
we can see in here is the use as i

575
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
mentioned previously i've alluded to

576
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
perhaps government infrastructure uh

577
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
that's being used to house one of the

578
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
backup command and control servers

579
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
and the reason we know this is because

580
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,200
the ip address of the command and

581
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,360
control server we can see

582
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
actually belong to the philippine

583
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,440
department of science and technology

584
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
so it was actually one of the systems

585
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,480
within their network

586
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
that was acting as a backup command and

587
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
crop control so it is quite a

588
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,679
fascinating step but that's something

589
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,799
i've really seen

590
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,200
um that often but what was really

591
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
concerning at the time is we could

592
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,200
actually see

593
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
evidence of the malware that was

594
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,919
hard-coded to access this address

595
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,720
so it was out there and it was actually

596
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,360
being you

597
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
so it wasn't just an accidental thing

598
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
that somebody had done or somebody left

599
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
behind it was genuinely being used so

600
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
you know a little bit worrying because

601
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,480
at the end of the day if it's not

602
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,919
passing out to the internet you know

603
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,280
we're never going to see this stuff so

604
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,000
it makes it

605
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
a lot harder to pin down the thread

606
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,760
actor

607
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,799
okay you know so we'll just take a

608
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,760
couple of minutes now to

609
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,919
have a quick look at the tools to do

610
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,440
some a little bit tall used by this

611
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,960
group so we'll do some uh

612
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,080
some analysis in here so uh one of the

613
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,679
tricks that was used to kind of

614
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,840
hide uh the activity and make it uh

615
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,760
pretty difficult for us to um

616
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,520
to study them um was to use an algorithm

617
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,160
that

618
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,120
that randomized when their cnc servers

619
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,000
would be available

620
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,080
so if something's available constantly

621
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,520
it's a lot easier to look at it to

622
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,280
figure it out but if these things are up

623
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,799
for a short period of time they go down

624
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,720
again goes up in another place goes down

625
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,200
again

626
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
it's very very difficult to track it and

627
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
this is one of the reasons why they were

628
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,679
able to stay hidden

629
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,799
uh for so long from uh from 2015

630
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,080
onwards so what we can see uh what we

631
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,880
can actually see

632
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
here is um is the the algorithm that's

633
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,480
being used so the uh the dmg

634
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,440
method on the on the left-hand side

635
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,880
that's the yeah that's the algorithm

636
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,840
that actually works

637
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,160
out which commander control server is

638
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,440
going to be available

639
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,160
at any given time of the day uh the day

640
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,039
the year so

641
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,679
whatever it is uh the actual malware

642
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,240
itself

643
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,960
is fully aware of um of which commander

644
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
control center to

645
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
to access but obviously anyone else from

646
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,480
the outside wouldn't necessarily

647
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,760
know that so

648
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
uh the middle bit here is actually the

649
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,440
payload you can see there that's the uh

650
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,480
the area body

651
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,880
uh dll which we discussed um earlier

652
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,960
this is basically the uh custom remote

653
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,360
access

654
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,480
trojan back door that will

655
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,880
allow us to actually get in the network

656
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,919
from there

657
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,880
so um what then happens is once we do

658
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,679
that

659
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,000
then uh the malware starts to gather

660
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,600
data on the victim's machine

661
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,360
so it'll go off and you can see here

662
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
it's got a check ip

663
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
amazon aws.com so it's going to have a

664
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,720
look and try and work out what country

665
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,520
it's in

666
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
where it's located it will get the host

667
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
name username domain name

668
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
all this reconnaissance kind of stuff

669
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,559
that you want to be able to identify

670
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,600
the system now what you can do from

671
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
there is once you identify the systems

672
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
you can decide how useful it is

673
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,360
what do i want to do with it so we take

674
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,440
this uh this basic information

675
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,520
all of that's put out it's then um

676
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,559
zipped up

677
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,159
uh the malware then protects the file

678
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,440
with a password because you they

679
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,799
wouldn't want just anybody

680
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,120
accessing their uh their malware files

681
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
and those files are then sent back to

682
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,960
the attackers to be looked at

683
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,520
uh we can then decide what we want to do

684
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,600
so with this particular

685
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,799
malware one of the things that have

686
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,880
changed hugely when we looked at the

687
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,640
tools just the amount of functions that

688
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,760
it could do

689
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,520
so if you think about it we've got lots

690
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,600
of government institutions

691
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,200
across many many different countries and

692
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,960
all of them would have different things

693
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,080
to be able to do

694
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
so it's very important to have a really

695
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,799
really good flexible tool

696
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,640
and this is what they have so we could

697
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
create processes and we can inject

698
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,600
ourselves into it

699
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,159
uh we can delete files we can find files

700
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,840
create directory we can get more

701
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,039
information

702
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,039
we can do usb monitor mode zip

703
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,159
directories up

704
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,840
so this is just a few of the functions

705
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,760
they have but it really gives you

706
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
an insight into the choices that you've

707
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
got once you've broken in these are all

708
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,960
the different things

709
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,640
that you can do now these aren't all of

710
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
them many many more

711
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,400
that we can do we can do key loggers we

712
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
could get screen grabs

713
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
so we can do whatever what this shows is

714
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
just how much over kind of the last

715
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
five years since we initially saw this

716
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
organization

717
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
just how much better they've got just

718
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
how much more professional and how much

719
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,039
more dangerous

720
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,559
they've got as well and i think these

721
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,640
are the key things

722
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,280
so attribution so how do we know who it

723
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,240
was

724
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,360
um so malware tends to be some of them

725
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,799
highway writers tend to be a little bit

726
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,520
lazy

727
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,919
something works you use it you go with

728
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,679
it but for us that's kind of a good

729
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,360
thing because it enables us to

730
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,280
to be able to to look at and build a set

731
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
of rules to try and identify

732
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,360
um sort of characteristics of different

733
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
malware has in common

734
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,440
so what we've got here is a comparison

735
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,000
between what kaspersky found back in

736
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
2015

737
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,919
and then what checkpoint discovered

738
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,919
later so if you see the points mark one

739
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,840
two and three they're consistent they're

740
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,120
exactly the same

741
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
and what we've then done what we've not

742
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
done what the group's done

743
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,000
is they've increased them the number of

744
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,360
functions that they have so they've

745
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
increased

746
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,880
their code so what we're able to do as a

747
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
checkpoint is we have a malware

748
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,280
dna engine so what we can do is we can

749
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,080
feed it in

750
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,400
and um although some people like to say

751
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,520
ai of course it's not

752
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
artificial intelligence as it doesn't

753
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,280
really exist it uses machine learning

754
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
then to be able to crunch all this

755
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,440
malware

756
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,679
and show us where we get consistencies

757
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,360
between other types and what this helps

758
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,080
us to do

759
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,240
is to fingerprint it and really track

760
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
what the uh the different organizations

761
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,360
and the different groups

762
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
have been up to at different points in

763
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
time so it's a really really important

764
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,240
use of ai

765
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,000
and one of the one of the key

766
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,679
technologies that we have in our battles

767
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,960
against um against these people

768
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
so there were some other code

769
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,159
similarities that uh came out as well so

770
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,280
on the left we've got the

771
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,600
area body information gathering and then

772
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,799
we've got the older

773
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,720
excess function information gathering on

774
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,559
the right so what we can see here when

775
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,360
we look at it

776
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
is some of the functions are absolutely

777
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,120
identical to the old back door that

778
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,559
kaspersky found

779
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,360
so in here we can see the function there

780
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,679
on

781
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,960
basically how it's looking at the

782
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
install software on the machine so

783
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,440
uh using the tried on honest tested

784
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,600
thing if it isn't broke then don't fix

785
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,080
it

786
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,159
we can see what we've done here is it

787
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,360
has been reused so

788
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
we're able to then be more and more

789
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,480
certain that we're dealing with the same

790
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,120
actors

791
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,520
uh now as we have been uh back in

792
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,480
previously

793
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
the other thing as well that gives us

794
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
the distribution is

795
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,679
a number of the domains are the same so

796
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,520
we saw that on the slide earlier that

797
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,240
there's been

798
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
the consistency on a couple of the

799
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,440
domains running through so

800
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,720
some of them are exactly the same as

801
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,240
they were previous back in 2015.

802
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,919
so when we take all these things

803
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,240
together that gives us a picture and an

804
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,279
image of

805
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,279
who they are so who is um an acorn apt

806
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,320
so this is what we found out about them

807
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,600
based on all the evidence and everything

808
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
that we have and all this is available

809
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,159
if you want to go to the czech

810
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
research website you could go take a

811
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,520
look at it

812
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
but given um given the complexity and

813
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,559
the advanced nature of the tools used

814
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,840
uh we're pretty sure it's a

815
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,760
state-sponsored operation

816
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
uh there is overlapping infrastructure

817
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
with other identified state-sponsored

818
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,799
groups as well

819
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,480
uh the target which as we've seen

820
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
through it is various government

821
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,760
exercises in apac although that's now

822
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,159
uh certainly moving across and there was

823
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:00,880
a lot of

824
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,080
um code similarity as well with um other

825
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,480
apts uh within this region so we'll be

826
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
able to say this with um

827
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,600
some measure of um of confidence

828
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,279
so how do we threat them well what we do

829
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,720
with uh checkpoint

830
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,760
is we get a whole bunch of indicators of

831
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,600
compromise which uh which are what these

832
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,000
are

833
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,840
so you can see look at uh we can see

834
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,600
there if you've got any of these um

835
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
the area body loaders then you've

836
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
probably got something of

837
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
an issue a problem there and we further

838
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,039
identified as well

839
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,080
uh delivery uh mechanisms the body

840
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,760
payload the loaders so

841
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,120
if you see any of this stuff kicking

842
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
around on your system then you've got

843
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
something of a serious problem or if you

844
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,880
can see anyone accessing any of these

845
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,159
cnc servers

846
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,159
then potentially you know you've got um

847
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,200
you've got a little bit of a serious

848
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,320
problem there

849
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
one of the things you've got to remember

850
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,159
i think with cyber security generally

851
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,480
i think it was in the film shrek they

852
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,320
said that ogres are like onions

853
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
but cyber defense is also like onions

854
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
it's got to have layers

855
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,360
and if you haven't got those layers and

856
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,279
you cannot hope to stop

857
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,880
also as well it's okay to have the

858
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,960
layers but one thing we've been banging

859
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
on at checkpoint for a long time

860
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,440
is you can no longer do detect because

861
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,039
by the time you do a detector by the

862
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,320
time you realize that something's

863
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,880
happened

864
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,279
it's too late it's gone it's moved on or

865
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,559
it's been cleared away

866
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,400
so by the time we're detecting it's just

867
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
too late you know we've gone and moved

868
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,360
and we've got to change his parents we

869
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,400
want to prevent

870
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
because when you've got web access with

871
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,679
web services that are spinning up

872
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,039
for a couple of seconds then spinning

873
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,200
down and disappearing then prevent just

874
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,480
makes no sense anymore

875
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,840
so we've really got to look at this and

876
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,919
we've got to move to to deter

877
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,400
from detect mode to prevent mode and

878
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,320
then you have more chance given whoever

879
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,039
your um

880
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,559
your active vendor is so uh that's me

881
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,880
uh about done um hopefully i didn't

882
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
quite go over which is uh which over

883
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,600
should be okay so

884
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,039
thank you very much for your time and

885
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,840
for your attention

886
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,760
that's brilliant thanks very much derek

887
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,720
um there's been no questions that came

888
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,360
true

889
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,840
um i think i'll just double check

890
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,000
um no there was just a couple of

891
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,279
comments i think on the tools that

892
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,080
you're using

893
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,880
um but it's just incredible to see that

894
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
i can't hear you okay i can hear you

895
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,559
again now that they've gone

896
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,320
undetected for so long when you were

897
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
showing the infrastructure earlier

898
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,000
like my mind was blown that this were

899
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,840
going as far back as 2016 at some stage

900
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,440
and this is the thing you know it's all

901
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,679
about being quiet and we see it with

902
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,279
some of the other you know the really

903
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,120
big attacks the dns problems the

904
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,559
exchange problems with

905
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
uh and obviously solar winds as well you

906
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,919
know it's

907
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,520
it's a lot of things to go on for a long

908
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
long time you know low and slow and

909
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,159
under the radar

910
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,440
and it can be very difficult and

911
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
sometimes you trip on something and find

912
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,679
them

913
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,760
but uh yeah a lot of these organizations

914
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,880
are

915
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,000
staying out the way but if you're an

916
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
espionage the last thing you want is to

917
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,440
be able to find you which is why we try

918
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,799
to do just that

919
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,399
absolutely um we've gotten to the end of

920
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,520
