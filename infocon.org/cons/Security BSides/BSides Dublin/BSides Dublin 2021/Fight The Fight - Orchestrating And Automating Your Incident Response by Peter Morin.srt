1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,399
uh

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,480
yeah so uh uh my name is peter morton

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,920
i'm a uh

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,679
practice lead for grant thornton here in

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,759
canada uh i'm on the east coast in

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,039
halifax uh

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,080
been doing this for about 25 years um

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
learned a lot of different things uh

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
through my trials and tribulations and

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,480
uh

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,160
left to speak about them at various

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,480
conferences and so on

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,119
uh so just right off the bat uh you know

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,880
like everybody else i'm i'm not a lawyer

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,200
but

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
uh you know uh i do these presentations

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,040
on

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,280
for myself and for others and uh i don't

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,879
endorse any products i and i don't

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,640
obviously speak for my employer

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
i speak for myself so just to get that

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
out of the way

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
so just a couple things i wanted to kind

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,640
of go over

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,879
initially um and i do quite a bit of

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,559
incident response and

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,239
and uh it's funny because there's a lot

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,079
of things that we see we've seen over

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,600
the past 10 years that are still there

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,199
and there's a lot of new things

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,199
um and i kind of wanted to kind of lead

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,799
into this with a little bit of

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,200
info on what's going on what i'm seeing

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,960
now the first one is really interesting

35
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,560
uh when we look at like things like

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
ransomware as a service

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,640
because um malware as a service is not

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,439
something new

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,680
uh we've seen it many many for many many

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,479
years

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,360
um allowing essentially people that

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,159
don't have

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
necessarily a very strong coding

44
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,159
background or or a good coding

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,799
background

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,159
to still be effective as criminals

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,200
being able to leverage the coding that's

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,920
been done by

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
other other criminals out there and be

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
able to purchase

51
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,439
ransomware as a service um obviously

52
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,119
lowers the bar of entry space

53
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,439
into this area so what ends up happening

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,479
is it it's

55
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,560
you know it becomes very commoditized

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
and and we start to see this more and

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,040
more

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
because it's so easy to to get a hold of

59
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
now

60
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,119
um other things we do we see quite a bit

61
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,159
of uh

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,680
what's being referred to more and more

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,640
as island hopping um or the use of a uh

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
a weak third party

65
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
um to make their way into a uh you know

66
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,479
a

67
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,318
more maybe a more secure party through

68
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,520
trust relationship

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
so we saw that you know back in 2014

70
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,959
with target

71
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,120
um i was listening to a presentation

72
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,959
earlier there was a mention of the rsa

73
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,920
breach

74
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,959
uh that happened a long time ago with uh

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,640
with the the thought of being able to

76
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
breach uh us government

77
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,319
uh um contractors um so again another

78
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,080
another thing we're having to look at is

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,720
now

80
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
you know when we're trying to figure out

81
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,879
where the breach started

82
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,160
you know it could be outside of the

83
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,680
walls of the actual organization

84
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,440
um the good old covet 19 pandemic

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,599
obviously what i refer to as a

86
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
increasingly permeable perimeter

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,560
so obviously we've had to make a lot of

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,239
changes to the way we work

89
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
um i've worked with a lot of companies

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
that had like you know two to three year

91
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
cloud projects to move things to the

92
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,319
cloud to go to office 365

93
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,959
or to google or what have you and and

94
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,640
with the pandemic they've turned that

95
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,319
around in six months

96
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,599
so obviously you know a lot less

97
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,400
preparation

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,159
a lot less focus on and security and now

99
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,480
that

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,920
things are in the cloud obviously

101
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
they're accessible by anybody

102
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,560
as opposed to uh for example an on-prem

103
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
service so

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,720
um areas like shadow i.t and so on

105
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,440
obviously

106
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,560
i've brought a lot a lot more

107
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
a lot more emphasis on this

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,319
um the whole concept of counter incident

109
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,680
response as well

110
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,959
so a lot of really strong uh techniques

111
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,480
to um to really hide the incident

112
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
um so uh whether it's basic obfuscation

113
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,920
of what's going on all the way to things

114
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
like you know

115
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,560
sandbox evasion timestamp manipulation

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
and and really a lot of it i've seen is

117
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,799
just a lot of complexity

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,120
so complexity on top of complexity and

119
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
what ends up happening is

120
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,280
you know as as paul mentioned as blue

121
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,159
teamers

122
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,480
you know our job is to make get things

123
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,159
back to normal and

124
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
get the organization operating again and

125
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,599
in some cases

126
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,040
that doesn't really lend us a lot of

127
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
time to figure out what's going on

128
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
because we're you know we've got that

129
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,120
person on our back that's telling us

130
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
you know we got to get back to normal we

131
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
have to get back to normal

132
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,720
um and which in many cases forces people

133
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
to pay ransoms for example and

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,919
ransomware attacks

135
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,080
um a good example here was the uk

136
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
national cyber security center

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,479
uh ransomware attack uh where they ended

138
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,000
up paying the ransom

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
didn't really take the time to under

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,400
identify the root cause of the attack

141
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
and um and and basically uh they ended

142
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,160
up getting

143
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,280
uh reinfected again i just saw this just

144
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,800
a little while ago in an incident i was

145
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,759
working on

146
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
or or i was asked to work on where we

147
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
asked you know how did the security if

148
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,199
you figured out what the attack vector

149
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,919
was

150
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,240
and they said no we haven't but uh you

151
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,759
know we have we have an organization

152
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,639
around

153
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,880
so this has made things a lot more

154
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,759
difficult for

155
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
us in the incident response space

156
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
uh we know that as well you know this

157
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,759
isn't uh you know

158
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
just the small organizations being hit i

159
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,120
mean there are

160
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
huge organizations even in in the

161
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,560
security space

162
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
that are being targeted and hit with

163
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
this so you know

164
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
i i don't think this is anything to say

165
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
that uh you know if you're a bank

166
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,240
or or a security company or or a

167
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
social media organization even with

168
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
large security teams i mean like i said

169
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
complexity has its uh has its value when

170
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
it when when breaches are

171
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,680
occurring right

172
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,840
so where i'm kind of going with this is

173
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
you know obviously the thing that we're

174
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
always trying to do is reduce that dwell

175
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,199
time so for those who don't know what

176
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,319
dwell time is

177
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,919
i mean it's a bit of a marketing term

178
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,759
but essentially what it is the

179
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,199
time from intrusion to containment so

180
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,520
essentially when an attacker gets in the

181
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,479
environment

182
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,680
the amount of time that they're running

183
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,280
around in your network without you

184
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,840
knowing

185
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
is basically what we consider the dwell

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
time

187
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
so obviously the longer they're in your

188
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,319
network the longer they

189
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,319
get to know what's going on there the

190
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,600
longer they have

191
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,720
time to um to basically

192
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,919
um obtain what their target is um the

193
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,600
longer time they have to potentially

194
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
exfiltrate

195
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
um build back doors that kind of thing

196
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
so uh the average we're seeing here is

197
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,080
uh

198
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
you know about 100 days it's it's gotten

199
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,919
better over time but it's still

200
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,720
quite high uh you know if we remember

201
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
the marriott breach that happened

202
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
a number of years ago that was a

203
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
four-year dwell time

204
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,800
so in some cases you know these

205
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
attackers are sitting

206
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
idle in the network uh without us

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,759
knowing for quite a long

208
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,440
time right so um what i want to talk to

209
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,880
you more and more in this presentation

210
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,039
is not necessarily just intrusion

211
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,880
it's other pieces of the puzzle like

212
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,319
containment which are really really

213
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,479
important

214
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,479
so as we know most organizations will

215
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,759
have some kind of

216
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
incident response life cycle they'll

217
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,319
have some kind of um

218
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,639
process they want to follow i put up the

219
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,400
one here from nist because it's fairly

220
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
well known

221
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,199
um so obviously the goals of this

222
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,960
process are to

223
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,240
minimize the damage of the attack um

224
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,400
minimize the time to recover from the

225
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
attack

226
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,759
um and basically create instructions and

227
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,280
defensive measures that would prevent

228
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
the attack in the future so that

229
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
essentially you know you want to make

230
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,919
sure that the organization is not

231
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
limping at the end and you want to learn

232
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
from what's gone what's gone on in

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,240
during the attack so we typically will

234
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,759
follow this kind of uh

235
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
this kind of life cycle for instance

236
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,919
response

237
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,800
now where i want to focus on is this

238
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,360
this concept of containment so

239
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
you know in the security world i mean we

240
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
all suffer from a bit of shiny ball

241
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
syndrome we all like our technology and

242
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
so on

243
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,759
and and we tend to really focus on

244
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
detection we tend to focus on like you

245
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
know if we could figure out that they're

246
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,000
doing something we can catch them we can

247
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
you know if we if we can figure out

248
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,160
there in the network we can do something

249
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
and and don't get me wrong that's all

250
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,400
important and that's all as important

251
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,639
as all the other steps in in your

252
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,840
incident response

253
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,319
process but where i'm seeing more and

254
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,240
more that i'm being kind of

255
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
like i said at the beginning where i've

256
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,520
had the person on my back

257
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
is around containment and and

258
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,880
specifically

259
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
the problem i'm seeing is you know when

260
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
you think you've

261
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,320
you've found that um you found that

262
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,599
source in the network

263
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,000
of the attack you figured out you know

264
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
what they're doing

265
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,880
it's the time to contain all that to get

266
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,760
closer like while properly doing your

267
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,040
incident response

268
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,000
it's the time to get closer to to back

269
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,399
going back to normal operations so

270
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,080
um what i like to refer to as

271
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
essentially stopping the bleeding right

272
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,279
so essentially being able to reconfigure

273
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,320
our network

274
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,440
to be able to start processes up

275
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,880
and this phase can really kill a

276
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
security team because

277
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,480
in a lot of cases it this is like for

278
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
example with ransomware

279
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,920
as you know as you think you've caught

280
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
it and it's spreading more and more

281
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,640
your security team is now focused on

282
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
just dealing with that

283
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
um and uh you know that that can take

284
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
your security team off of

285
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,920
other things it can also be a bit of a

286
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,519
smoke screen for other attacks that

287
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
might be occurring

288
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,800
on the average what we see and you can

289
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
see healthcare kind of rated the top

290
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
uh the average 73 days to contain a

291
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
breach

292
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,839
so that's like you know in certain cases

293
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,360
for organizations

294
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
that can be a death to an organization i

295
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
did an instant response in a ransomware

296
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
case for a number of hospitals

297
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
and i mean they had to shut down like

298
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,360
cancer

299
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,959
treatment wings and move them to other

300
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,959
hospitals and you know

301
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,040
the longer it takes to contain the thing

302
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,200
and to kind of

303
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
bring your organization back to a normal

304
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
state

305
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
can be very very detrimental to the

306
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
organization obviously

307
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,640
so that's where i want to focus on

308
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,200
essentially is that containment piece so

309
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,279
companies that contain a breach in less

310
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,800
than 30 days

311
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
can save more than a million dollars in

312
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
comparison to those that take longer

313
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,880
so the quicker that we can contain the

314
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,600
breach the quicker that the organization

315
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
is not hemorrhaging money and

316
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,640
resources now again i also don't want to

317
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,079
take away from the other pieces of the

318
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,800
puzzle in

319
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
instant response they're all important

320
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
but um

321
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
like i said i want to focus this talk

322
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,839
more so on the containment side of

323
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
things

324
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,279
so if we look at containment obviously

325
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,640
you know if we have a server in the

326
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
organization that's compromised

327
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
the security teams got to isolate that

328
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,920
server from the network

329
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,519
what's involved in doing that now that's

330
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,519
a simple case of one server

331
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,519
but what is involved in actually doing

332
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,320
that what's involved in isolating that

333
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
does the organization prepared do they

334
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,040
know exactly what's involved

335
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,839
you know if they have a database server

336
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,880
that's been

337
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,640
that they want to contain as part of a

338
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
breach you know

339
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
is that documented most people document

340
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
you know certain processes

341
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,279
in their incident response but do you

342
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,440
have playbooks for specific types of

343
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,680
breaches or specific types of incidents

344
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,959
right

345
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,200
the security team also has to adjust for

346
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
example routing policies

347
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
so that they can now distribute the

348
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,959
server that's been affected

349
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,720
they can distribute the load to other

350
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
servers for example

351
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,079
now when you look at that is that

352
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,920
documented does the team know how to do

353
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,240
that

354
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
really quickly um does it involve a

355
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,240
third party do you have a

356
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
another company that manages your

357
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,920
upstream routers for example your

358
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,959
firewalls

359
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,440
you know are they involved so you know

360
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
having this stuff documented can be

361
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
like a lifesaver at the end of the day

362
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,360
right um and the other thing is

363
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
how much are you enabling your frontline

364
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,920
people to do some of this work

365
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
like let's say you're an organization

366
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
that has five security people

367
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,880
dedicated security people and you have a

368
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,399
major incident

369
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,120
like your five security people like for

370
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,279
them to sit back and start to

371
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,360
deal with containment while everything

372
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,120
else is going crazy

373
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
might not be the best use of their time

374
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,680
so how much can you enable your tier one

375
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
your front line people

376
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,079
to help contain what's going on during

377
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,200
the incident

378
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,639
so a lack of solid containment processes

379
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,480
could lead with a threat still being

380
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
present

381
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
and spreading in the environments that's

382
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,360
as i said you know

383
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,880
if you don't understand or you don't

384
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
have a way to quickly contain

385
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
you know it could take longer and longer

386
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,079
and longer for that breach to

387
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,839
to basically subside

388
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,639
so to do this we like to focus on

389
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,360
automation

390
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,639
so uh obviously automating things

391
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
may may have a good effect on decreasing

392
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,639
the average response time

393
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
so if you can automate mundane and

394
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,760
time-consuming

395
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,079
security tasks that allows you to

396
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,600
allocate your it

397
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,279
your your senior it people and your

398
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,120
security team's time

399
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
to higher level duties that are part of

400
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,560
that breach

401
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,519
right or even just keep the organization

402
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:21,920
like

403
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,279
when you're having a breach like the

404
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,200
organization's like you know

405
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
these people were there before the

406
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,600
breach to do other things

407
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
so now when they're dealing with the

408
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,800
breach who's actually operating the i.t

409
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,920
for the organization at that time right

410
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,720
so so having some kind of automation

411
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
will really

412
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,440
assist you in that in that process

413
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
and that's where we come into this whole

414
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,800
concept of soar

415
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,720
now i know i know there's a lot of

416
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,639
people that are at the conference today

417
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,800
that work for security companies

418
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,440
and soar over the last couple years has

419
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,959
really taken off

420
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
um no pun intended with the picture on

421
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,320
the screen

422
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
it's really taken off and a lot of

423
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,760
security companies are starting to buy

424
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,560
up

425
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,279
companies that focused on soar or what

426
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
we refer to as security orchestration

427
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
automation response

428
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,480
so you're starting to see a lot of

429
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
organizations out there you know splunk

430
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,639
rapid seven other companies

431
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,480
that are starting to integrate soar into

432
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
their products because

433
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,839
in many cases they're already ingrained

434
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
into your organization

435
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
monitoring what's going on identifying

436
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
vulnerabilities that kind of thing right

437
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
so what is soar so at the end of the day

438
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:31,920
soar

439
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,120
is essentially a number of processes um

440
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,160
to assist in the incident response um

441
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,279
and it starts with that

442
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,279
orchestration piece where you're

443
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,639
essentially uh

444
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,000
connecting all these despair

445
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,079
technologies in your organization

446
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,360
as well as security tools and using that

447
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,480
information to essentially improve the

448
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,079
speed at which you respond to an

449
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,040
incident

450
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
so that could be like threaten tel

451
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
threat until data

452
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
that could be like uh emails received by

453
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,959
other systems

454
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,360
that could be like uh information like

455
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,079
ip's

456
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,959
host names uh iocs all that kind of

457
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,160
information

458
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,240
that will help you kind of better

459
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,360
understand

460
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,079
what's going on so that you can start to

461
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,000
act a little quicker

462
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,279
that is part of that security

463
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,920
orchestration piece

464
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
after that we have this piece uh we

465
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,199
refer to as automation

466
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,760
so at that point like based on this

467
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,120
intelligence you're getting from the

468
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
orchestration side of things

469
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
you know what can we do to automate

470
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,959
processes

471
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,440
so that can be things like uh like i

472
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
said d provisioning users

473
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,800
you know you think there's a user

474
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
involved as as part of the breach

475
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,040
well i want to de-provision that user i

476
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
want to kick off some

477
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,680
sandboxing some malware analysis i want

478
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,480
to kick off

479
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,240
some you know some querying of logs i

480
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,000
want to kick off some um

481
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,759
some passive monitoring i want to gather

482
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,120
up some p caps

483
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199
any things that you would actually use a

484
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,800
human that are very

485
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,839
um kind of automated in style instead of

486
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,920
having a human basically go and sit

487
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,519
there and do these things

488
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,959
well let's have them as part of your

489
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,639
playbook process

490
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,480
so when something happens these

491
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,079
automated processes happen in the

492
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,120
background

493
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,639
and we can reap the benefits of them

494
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,399
without having to actually sit in front

495
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,480
of a screen and perform them

496
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,399
and then the last piece is that response

497
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,600
piece so that's

498
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,920
you know uh integrating data from other

499
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,959
security tools

500
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,120
um maybe that's opening a ticket in

501
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,199
something like servicenow

502
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,279
to uh to create a case related to the

503
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,240
incident

504
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
uh maybe that's taking the data that

505
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
you've you've taken so

506
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,639
maybe it's iocs or ttps that you've

507
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,720
you've gathered during the incident

508
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,320
and converting that into threat

509
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
intelligence so that the cycle can

510
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,480
restart itself

511
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,959
so all these things that we used to have

512
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,320
you know people doing

513
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,399
and i'm not saying that because people

514
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,920
were doing this they shouldn't be

515
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
she should be part of organization this

516
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,759
allows us to take those people

517
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,199
and put them onto more complex jobs

518
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,439
and more jobs more jobs that require you

519
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,400
know really

520
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,799
deep human intervention as opposed to

521
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,559
things that were very much

522
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,559
automated um and in the past right

523
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,079
so if you look at it from a technology

524
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,760
perspective and again i'm not

525
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
endorsing any of this these are just

526
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
general types of technology that are

527
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,160
used

528
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,559
we can see at the top there we have um

529
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,080
we have some tools like

530
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,120
uh you know firewall logs and dhcp logs

531
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,520
um that are being fired into various

532
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
sims or

533
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,720
log management tools you know whether

534
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,799
it's uh splunk or sumo logic or

535
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,120
what have you um we have those being

536
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
consumed

537
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,280
then we also have things like um

538
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,080
enrichment

539
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,039
so that data being enriched by various

540
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,360
uh

541
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,400
endpoint tools um anti-malware tools

542
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
uh maybe you've got some uh web-based uh

543
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,960
gateway tools like a blue coat

544
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,080
box or or what have you um and then we

545
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,640
have some

546
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400
automated things that are also happening

547
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
so some things like um

548
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
automatically invoked a remediation as

549
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,400
well as some manual

550
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
so that could be basically opening up

551
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
tickets uh that could be essentially

552
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,039
performing some kind of forensics

553
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
um some uh you know some endpoint

554
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,200
blocking some

555
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
you know that kind of thing so you can

556
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,799
see here that all these

557
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,200
all these these uh companies all these

558
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,960
security companies are players in that

559
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
sore environment

560
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,480
and then essentially we usually have

561
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,760
some kind of tool to

562
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,559
bring them all together so i'll give you

563
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,320
an example here's just rapid sevens

564
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
product but there's

565
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,919
other ones you know splunk has a product

566
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,039
called phantom they

567
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,480
they've all all these companies have

568
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
kind of been buying up these

569
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,400
independent uh soar companies and

570
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,559
integrating them into their products

571
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
so you could see here for example um

572
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,400
this is a

573
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
rapid sevens product and they have a

574
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
playbook here

575
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
that is uh basically quarantining an

576
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,120
asset

577
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
by using a product like carbon black

578
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,799
which is obviously not a rapid seven

579
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,600
product

580
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,679
but it's about integrating all of your

581
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,919
disparate security tools

582
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,559
so as you can see here in this process i

583
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:14,960
have

584
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
quarantined asset request i have

585
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
isolation of the sense the

586
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
carbon black sensor so that carbon black

587
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,559
response

588
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
endpoint i have the the information on

589
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,160
the

590
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,320
quarantine and then whether or not the

591
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,280
host should be back

592
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,440
allowed back on the network so with

593
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
something like the rapid7 product it

594
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,480
allows you to

595
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,240
basically build this workflow

596
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,799
that is essentially your playbook and

597
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,919
then execute them

598
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,640
when something happens so as there's an

599
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,400
asset request coming in

600
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
all these things get kicked off and

601
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,760
these things could have been

602
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,240
manual steps in the past but it allows

603
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,720
us allows our security people

604
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
to now be tasked with doing the more

605
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,100
complex jobs

606
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,320
[Music]

607
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,559
so that being said a lot of the space i

608
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,120
work in

609
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
so my specialties and around critical

610
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,640
infrastructure

611
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
industrial control systems ot

612
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,679
environments and so on

613
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,200
now in a lot of cases for those of you

614
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
who work in the space we know that

615
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
it's not always perfect you know you

616
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,120
know we we love

617
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
we you know if i if i go back a couple

618
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,640
slides

619
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,720
we love it when organizations look like

620
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
this

621
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,919
but they don't always look like this and

622
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,840
there's a lot of reasons for that

623
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,600
and a lot of circumstances where

624
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,080
organizations are just not going to have

625
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,799
all the red bells and whistles that we

626
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,039
want them to have in the environment so

627
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,640
that could be things like environments

628
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
where you know an enterprise tool is not

629
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,600
deployed

630
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,240
uh i know that sounds really scary but

631
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,679
it does happen where you go

632
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,799
and the for example your corporate i.t

633
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,400
environment has something really great

634
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,559
has a crowdstrike or it has a sentinel

635
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,159
one or whatever it is

636
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,960
as an edr tool but in your production

637
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,600
network

638
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
in in my case it could be a

639
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
manufacturing network it could be

640
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,039
some kind of uh ot network doesn't have

641
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,320
any of that

642
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,480
for many many reasons and maybe the

643
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,000
minimal thing they have is maybe a bit

644
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,799
of white listing

645
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,880
which you know maybe doesn't suit your

646
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
needs

647
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,760
so you could also have things like

648
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,600
legacy environments you know that

649
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,880
don't support some of the new edr tools

650
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,799
what about large cloud environments

651
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,039
where you don't have anything deployed

652
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,000
because they're temporary you could have

653
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
in many cases

654
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,440
a recently acquired network so maybe

655
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
you've taken on a network

656
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,080
and your plan is over the next year to

657
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,799
bring them up to speed with new tools

658
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,840
uh you may have a decentralized uh

659
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
log collection you could have air gap

660
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,080
networks i mean as their gaps as we know

661
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,000
networks can be but at the end of the

662
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,919
day like the thing is you know you can

663
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,320
have a network that just doesn't suit

664
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,080
um the requirements that you would have

665
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,919
in a corporate it environment

666
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,360
and that's where some of these tools and

667
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,280
i've put a bunch of them here again

668
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240
um just uh some examples here things

669
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,360
like chef

670
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,559
um salt stack and puppet and so on um

671
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,120
may be it will be a short term or even

672
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,720
maybe a long-term solution to that

673
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,480
problem

674
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
so i'm going to use the example of

675
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
ansible i'm a pretty big fan of it

676
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,360
because

677
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,320
it you know i've exceeded a lot of

678
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,679
environments because it isn't

679
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,400
necessarily just a security tool a lot

680
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,919
of organizations that are going to

681
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,080
things like devops in the cloud

682
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
they tend to use ansible to do

683
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,159
deployments so it's it's in a lot of

684
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:36,720
cases

685
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
a tool that an organization may already

686
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
have and they may have people

687
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,200
that have a skill set in that um it's

688
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
agentless which is great i don't have to

689
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
worry about deploying something to the

690
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,919
machine

691
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,919
and it failing how many times have we

692
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,520
deployed like a needy iron

693
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,080
for some reason uh they're missing

694
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,440
something stupid like

695
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
net or the thing just doesn't deploy or

696
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,080
maybe they're not on a high-speed

697
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,559
network that's good enough to do that

698
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,360
um it's python based um you know i

699
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,880
haven't been as a true software

700
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,080
developer

701
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,559
probably for 20 years now so something

702
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,960
that is scripted is really easy for me

703
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,360
um it's deployed with things like ssh

704
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,120
which is pretty common for example in

705
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,400
the linux environment

706
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,559
or windows remote management it does

707
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,480
support other things like ruby it

708
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,520
supports

709
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,600
powershell and a bunch of other

710
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
secondary languages

711
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,880
um it's modular it's push-based

712
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,720
um and it also supports a number of

713
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,720
environments for management of network

714
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,039
and storage devices so it will also

715
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,679
support things like cisco devices and f5

716
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,720
devices

717
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
so if you want to make changes to your

718
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,159
rules on your f5

719
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,520
uh and your f5 gateways you can do that

720
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,360
with ansible as well and and from an

721
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,720
adoption perspective

722
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,159
it's pretty simple to put into your

723
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,640
environment

724
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
so how does it really work well it's

725
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,440
pretty simple you've got

726
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
a management note of some sort and then

727
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,480
you've got um

728
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,279
an inventory of all your systems and

729
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,720
that could be based on ip

730
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
host name what have you then you have a

731
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
bunch of playbooks

732
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,279
that provide what you really want to do

733
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,480
those systems

734
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,080
and you essentially launch those

735
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,000
playbooks against the inventory

736
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,159
and you know you have you have uh

737
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,559
changes to those systems

738
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,360
so what those playbooks look like um and

739
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,240
they're essentially

740
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,360
it's essentially in yamo uh format

741
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,159
it essentially um defines a set of

742
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,919
activities or tasks you want to run on

743
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,120
that host

744
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,440
so a task can be things like execute a

745
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,400
script a command

746
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,679
run a script if it's linux install a

747
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,039
package

748
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,200
down restart a host you could pretty

749
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,080
much do

750
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,200
almost everything you can do with the

751
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,120
command line in the linux box through

752
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,799
um through an ansible yaml playbook

753
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,158
it's it's pretty remarkable

754
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,480
so the one thing i do want to bring into

755
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,360
into account is

756
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,039
the use of the attack framework so

757
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,120
whenever i'm building my playbooks

758
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,480
um in an ansible i tried to follow uh

759
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,880
what uh attack is gonna tell me i try to

760
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,400
follow some kind of framework

761
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,960
because what i'm trying to do is take

762
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
attack techniques

763
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
and essentially i'm trying to convert

764
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,600
them to

765
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
responses based in in a playbook and

766
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,200
ansible

767
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,559
so for example if an attacker for

768
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,320
you know apt xxx whatever

769
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,480
is typically going to do this type of

770
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
process on my machine

771
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,600
what i'm going to do is i'm going to try

772
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,080
to create an ansible playbook

773
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,039
to reverse that or to quarantine based

774
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,840
on

775
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,240
that technique that way you're actually

776
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,640
doing this based on real world attacks

777
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,159
and not just things that you think an

778
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,760
attacker might want to do

779
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
and and attack's great for that because

780
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,679
it's constantly being updated right

781
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,279
um so as you can see i mean there's

782
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,039
there's uh techniques

783
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,840
across the board and what we want to do

784
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,120
is essentially

785
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,159
try to build our our playbooks to to

786
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,440
take care of those various techniques

787
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
so from a use case perspective i kind of

788
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,640
broke this up into two things there's

789
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,919
the initial triage

790
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,919
which is part in my mind part of that

791
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,039
containment

792
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,120
so that could be gathering information

793
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
from systems that i don't necessarily

794
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,760
have

795
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,320
um uh that i don't necessarily have data

796
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,120
from

797
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,960
um so that i can actually start to

798
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
perform my containment

799
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,039
so if for example i don't collect logs

800
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,159
in a sim

801
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,039
or i don't have a log management system

802
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,679
um

803
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,320
but i'm dealing with like a lot of hosts

804
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
well maybe i want to start by collecting

805
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,120
some

806
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,240
some initial data to start

807
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,120
to be able to do my containment and i

808
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,480
gave a list here i'm going to go into

809
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
some details of some of the use cases

810
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,919
so here's a good example attack

811
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,480
technique uh commonly used in uh

812
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,120
carbonac lazarus you know dooku and so

813
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,159
on and so forth

814
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,360
is to create a new service um to be able

815
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,919
to

816
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,559
uh you know hide themselves as a machine

817
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,200
boots up

818
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,279
that kind of thing well maybe i want to

819
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,320
create a play

820
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,200
a playbook item that will go and check

821
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,240
for that service

822
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,279
based on ttps and um

823
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,480
at a minimum um stop that service in

824
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,360
windows

825
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
or disable it or what have you and this

826
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,039
is something like

827
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,159
as opposed to a a very skilled security

828
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:32,880
person

829
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,200
having to go in and do this you know how

830
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,039
about having a tier one person be able

831
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,120
to do this in an automated fashion

832
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,200
click a button and it turns the service

833
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,279
down and then the security guy can go

834
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,159
and then

835
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,720
basically do further clean up afterwards

836
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,440
right

837
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,720
so if we base it on the attack

838
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,880
techniques we're we're closer to the

839
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,840
typical

840
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,240
techniques that we want to do we want to

841
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,919
use as part of our containment process

842
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,360
so here's a scenario and this is

843
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,279
fictitious okay so these companies don't

844
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,159
exist

845
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,840
so take take for example we have a

846
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
company called meditek

847
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,679
that buys a company called bio life

848
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,360
vaccines because they're

849
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,240
they're creating covet 19 vaccines when

850
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,200
they buy

851
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,360
bio life they realize that bio biolife

852
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,960
has a very large

853
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
covet 19 research environment where

854
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,559
they're doing all kinds of testing and

855
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,440
so on

856
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,600
um and that environment is very much

857
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,960
it's aws based

858
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,440
and it's a lot of linux like lots

859
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,279
hundreds and hundreds right

860
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,880
uh you end up finding out that there is

861
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,480
very minimal knowledge uh because

862
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,679
they've you've laid off

863
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,760
a lot of the people because of the the

864
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
amalgamation of two companies

865
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
uh it was built quickly during the

866
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,159
pandemic so there's no edr

867
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,039
it's very flat um there's no centralized

868
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,080
authentication

869
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,720
um but they do have access via ssh with

870
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,760
keys

871
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
and and there's it's basically a lot of

872
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,200
linux boxes with apache web servers

873
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,240
so we have this guy here uh very nice

874
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,279
steven smith he's assisted men and uh

875
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,840
when meditek bought biolife they

876
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,720
basically said

877
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,480
hey you know what we're not going to

878
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,919
promote you because we're going to

879
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,840
promote some guy from biolife so he's

880
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,480
really disgruntled after 10 years

881
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,320
you know he's he's he wants to get back

882
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,679
to the organization

883
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,360
so his plan is to create a number of

884
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,880
backdoor accounts

885
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
on some key linux servers hosted in that

886
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,399
environment that's storing

887
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,600
ip intellectual property for meditek

888
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,640
and then he's going to install a

889
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,559
vulnerability to create a back door in

890
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,600
the web servers

891
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
to be able to access the data from

892
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,600
outside of the aws environment

893
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,279
so how do we deal with this there's

894
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,159
hundreds of servers we have no edr

895
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,000
we do have the name of the account that

896
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,080
he used so we do have that

897
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,840
but we have to be able to make sure that

898
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,600
we're you know we can completely contain

899
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,799
this right

900
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,840
so we have a a uh playbook

901
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,799
for um insider threat access and i won't

902
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,080
go through all of it but what you can

903
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,120
see here is

904
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,640
we have some processes around

905
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,159
information gathering

906
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,120
um as well as some contained processes

907
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,640
that we can actually automate with

908
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
ansible so

909
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,600
collecting some telemetry we want to

910
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,440
look at processes we want to see if that

911
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,559
web server is running um we we want to

912
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,320
be able to disable that account that he

913
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,200
created

914
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,000
and we also want to basically see has he

915
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,559
has he

916
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,279
um has he changed to root has he

917
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,720
elevated his privileges

918
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,960
and if he has well we probably want to

919
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,480
change the password

920
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,760
uh because there's a good chance he

921
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,520
knows the root password as well

922
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,720
or he's changed it to something he knows

923
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,200
so what do we do we bring ansible into

924
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,919
this

925
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,559
so as you can see here we have a really

926
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,240
really simple ansible

927
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,960
uh playbook on the left and essentially

928
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,559
what that's going to do is

929
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,000
you can see here there's a grep

930
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,320
statement it's going to grip for jsmith

931
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,880
which is the account he created in the

932
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,159
password file

933
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,679
okay and then essentially what it's

934
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,880
going to do is it's going to tell you

935
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,120
whether that account exists or not

936
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,880
now on the right side you can see the

937
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,480
output now i've only run it against a

938
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,760
couple hosts but

939
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,960
imagine you have 300 linux machines

940
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,799
you can run this ansible script the

941
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,720
simple simple ansible script

942
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,880
against those 300 machines and you can

943
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,080
see in green

944
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,320
2.140 the user account exists and

945
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,399
in 2.141 the user account doesn't exist

946
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,720
so i can run this and i can output this

947
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,840
to a file and in

948
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,880
a matter of a minute you know depending

949
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,519
on the latency of the network

950
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,519
minute maybe two minutes i could come

951
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,440
back and get a list of 300 servers and

952
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,799
they'll tell me which ones have this

953
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,679
account

954
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,919
so right off the bat i'm getting into my

955
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,120
containment

956
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
i'm starting to understand how bad it is

957
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,039
and and what i have to do

958
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,720
to to basically ensure myself

959
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,760
that that steven you know evil stephen

960
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
can't get into these systems right

961
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,840
so at that point i'm going to disable

962
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
these accounts right so

963
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,200
so as you can see here i'm going to use

964
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
the in this case on the linux box i'm

965
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,360
going to use a user the user mod command

966
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,279
and i'm going to basically do a minus l

967
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,480
minus e1

968
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,640
jsmith and you can see on the right hand

969
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,240
side here i've run this

970
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,440
now because um i'm running it against

971
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
those two servers one that had the

972
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,559
account one that didn't

973
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,000
you could see that only one of the

974
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
systems was updated and that was

975
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,880
what 2.140. um and you could see down at

976
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,159
the bottom when i try to log

977
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,039
in as jsmith obviously it's telling me

978
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,720
my account is expired now

979
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,919
some will say well why don't you just

980
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,919
remove the account well there's some

981
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,519
forensics we might want to do maybe we

982
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,760
want to take stephen to court

983
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,840
i don't know so we don't necessarily

984
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
want to maybe not remove the account

985
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,679
we just want to disable at this point so

986
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,919
we have a bit of forensic evidence

987
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,720
and we can see here in my secure log i

988
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
could see where

989
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,159
jsmith's account has been expired so

990
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,000
i'm able to do this against those

991
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
hundreds of servers

992
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
maybe more quickly than stephen can

993
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
actually do anything else to

994
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,120
turn that around on me

995
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,440
maybe i figured out that he has changed

996
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,799
the root password

997
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,120
and i want to change the password to my

998
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,840
300 linux boxes in the cloud

999
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,600
but i don't have to do that manually and

1000
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,080
i don't have centralized authentication

1001
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,519
so um there there is no there is no

1002
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,039
you know in the windows active directory

1003
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,720
world i'm not integrated with active

1004
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,240
directory or what have you so in this

1005
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,039
case

1006
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,760
i can do a really quick ansible playbook

1007
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,120
that essentially as you can see at the

1008
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,080
bottom here

1009
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,200
ansible playbook change password.yaml

1010
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,039
and then i'm going to basically pass an

1011
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,760
extra variable called new password

1012
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,080
and then input the new password and then

1013
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,360
essentially i run that

1014
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,279
and it updates the password across all

1015
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,240
my 300 servers in a matter of minutes

1016
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,720
and you can see here in this in the logs

1017
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,679
at the bottom

1018
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,080
you can see where i've actually changed

1019
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,360
the root password on that system

1020
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,120
so as you can see this is a really good

1021
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,559
way um and

1022
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,799
and i'm not saying hey go out there and

1023
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,600
get rid of

1024
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,760
your edr tool or your automation that

1025
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,799
you have

1026
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,679
but in a pinch where you might be stuck

1027
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,679
ansible could be a really big savior

1028
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,840
savior for you it has saved my life in

1029
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,879
many times

1030
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,639
when i go to a clients that i have to do

1031
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,918
incident response

1032
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,520
and i don't have anything available to

1033
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,839
me there's it's something i can pull out

1034
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,639
of my toolbox

1035
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,440
really really quickly so some other

1036
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,199
really good automated use cases so for

1037
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,399
example if you're going to collect

1038
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,040
logs from a remote host um the first

1039
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,320
thing you could do for example

1040
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,800
is run this really quick ansible script

1041
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,079
that is essentially going to

1042
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,159
take your inventory file and your

1043
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,440
inventory file is going to list

1044
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,000
all of your hosts that are in scope and

1045
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
it's going to create a directory

1046
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,879
for artifacts for each for each host

1047
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,839
and i tend to run this on a cron job so

1048
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,599
essentially like every night

1049
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,280
if a new system's been added to the

1050
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,000
inventory it's adding that

1051
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,399
host to the directory where artifacts

1052
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,079
will be stored when you once you pull

1053
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:54,960
them

1054
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
from those hosts so essentially maybe

1055
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,240
you want to get a process listing

1056
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,119
i know that seems pretty trivial but if

1057
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,040
you have 300 servers and you don't have

1058
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
an automated way of doing it

1059
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
you can do that with ansible so

1060
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,200
essentially i'm going to run a pscf

1061
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,960
and i'm going to register the result as

1062
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,640
ps result

1063
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,480
i'm going to essentially start by

1064
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,160
writing a remote process collection

1065
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
results to a local artifact so

1066
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,359
essentially what i'm doing is i'm

1067
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,000
running that ps ef command

1068
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,040
and i'm writing that back to a

1069
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,839
local file and then basically i'm

1070
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,359
running a process to make that

1071
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,400
that local file human readable again

1072
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,320
and essentially what you get is what you

1073
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,680
see on the right at the bottom

1074
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,800
you get a nice process listing um and

1075
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,200
then

1076
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
maybe you want to do you know you want

1077
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,160
to run a little script against those

1078
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,440
process listings

1079
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,920
grepping out for certain things so for

1080
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
example if

1081
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,599
you know there's an evil process called

1082
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,119
evil process

1083
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,119
and you have a directory of all of these

1084
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,040
processes that were that were just

1085
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,079
pulled

1086
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,680
you could write a quick script to do a

1087
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,079
grep against all of those files

1088
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,160
and identify which hosts have evil

1089
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,599
process writing

1090
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,520
so you can see it's it's kind of in

1091
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,359
between sims and edrs

1092
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,079
but but it's it's um it's a little bit

1093
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,359
more basic

1094
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,440
but it will it will save you in a lot of

1095
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,079
cases right

1096
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,760
maybe you want to pull apache logs from

1097
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,520
a web server well you can do that as

1098
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,839
well

1099
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,680
maybe you're not collecting them in a

1100
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,920
sim or in a log management system in

1101
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,680
this case i can do the same thing i can

1102
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,480
go

1103
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,119
uh do a cd to the directory where the

1104
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,560
apache logs are

1105
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,680
i can essentially

1106
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,280
basically do a find and cut out what i

1107
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,880
need and then essentially write them

1108
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,560
back to a loc the local

1109
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,880
control host and then i can search those

1110
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,599
again

1111
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,640
so it's kind of like a very very um

1112
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,800
basic version of sim so i could

1113
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
basically write some

1114
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,320
some some scripts after that to search

1115
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,680
through those logs if i needed to

1116
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,240
maybe i need to stop a service so

1117
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,200
example here

1118
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,000
here's an inventory file on the top left

1119
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,200
you can see there i have a bunch of

1120
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,480
scada servers

1121
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,960
and and i can use uh i can use different

1122
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,599
ways of

1123
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,520
of of not having to type out all those

1124
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,280
servers so for example i have

1125
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,240
scada 99 to 101 dash node.example.com

1126
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,320
or i have database servers or web

1127
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
servers by ip address so in this case

1128
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,560
i'm going to do an ansible web server so

1129
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,720
i'm going to refer to my web servers

1130
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,280
and i'm going to do a minus m service

1131
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
minus a

1132
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
and i'm going to essentially stop the

1133
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,079
httpd service

1134
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,520
so for example if you're being hit um by

1135
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,680
uh denial service and you want to stop

1136
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
all of your httpd servers for some

1137
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,480
reason

1138
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,320
um you can do that within a matter of

1139
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,480
minutes and affect hundreds of posts if

1140
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
you need to

1141
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,359
here's a really good one let's say

1142
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,640
you're running something like uh

1143
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,599
firewall d or ip tables or or

1144
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,320
a host based firewall and you want to

1145
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,599
basically

1146
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,359
put in blocks into that host-based

1147
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,880
firewall same thing

1148
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,400
you can add a block now in this case you

1149
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,800
can see here i'm adding a rich rule

1150
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,079
to firewall d to block everything uh

1151
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,000
uh in in 19198.20.2.0

1152
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,400
in that slash 24 block i want to block

1153
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,440
those things

1154
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,040
and then right after that i want to do a

1155
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,720
reload on the firewall

1156
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,880
and you can see here i processed that

1157
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,960
that change through ansible

1158
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,800
and in the bottom right you can see

1159
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,520
where that rule family has been added

1160
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,560
rejecting anybody from that block of ips

1161
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,400
so again when you're thinking about

1162
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,000
containment

1163
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,760
this is a great way of doing it i want

1164
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,160
to contain i'm getting hit with

1165
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,000
with ransomware i'm being hit with an

1166
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,480
attack i want to contain a bunch of

1167
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,119
very very critical servers with ip into

1168
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,000
a network

1169
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,320
i can affect you i can affect a firewall

1170
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,040
rule

1171
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
on a flat network so unless you have a

1172
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,560
flat network and you have no

1173
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,880
firewalls segmenting the network well

1174
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,400
how are you going to quarantine those

1175
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,240
systems so they don't get attacked

1176
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
well i can use you know something like

1177
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,240
firewall d really really quickly right

1178
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,760
so in in wrapping that up and and i'll

1179
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
have some time for some questions

1180
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,119
you know a couple things to think about

1181
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,520
like don't forget how critical

1182
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,760
triage and more so containment is in the

1183
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,280
phase of the incident

1184
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
um you know that is really going to

1185
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,480
reduce the dwell time at the end of the

1186
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,280
day

1187
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,000
because and and it's not only that but

1188
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,920
it's also the um

1189
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,440
how um you know how how

1190
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,960
your coverage of that containment is at

1191
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
the end of the day if it's if you're not

1192
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,440
if you're not sure that you've closed

1193
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,640
off all the servers

1194
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,359
in the problem or you know you you don't

1195
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,160
know that you've

1196
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,079
you've been able to remove all of the

1197
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,440
accounts affected

1198
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,359
like those can be enough to keep the

1199
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,800
attacker in the network for a longer

1200
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,680
period of time

1201
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,160
right uh remember the important role

1202
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
that automation can play in your ir plan

1203
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,800
it it adds speed to your containment

1204
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,160
when you're dealing with a large number

1205
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,200
of hosts

1206
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,599
and it's great if you're a for example a

1207
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,760
consultant incident responder

1208
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,359
it's a great tool to have when you're

1209
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,880
getting into an environment

1210
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,920
where you don't have a lot of

1211
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,720
information you don't know what's what

1212
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,400
ansible can be something where you can

1213
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
use to contain yourself

1214
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,079
really really quickly right now i've

1215
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,680
only shown you what ansible can do with

1216
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,560
linux

1217
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,200
now it will uh it will now work on

1218
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,920
windows

1219
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,680
you can you can actually execute

1220
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,079
powershell scripts with ansible

1221
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,040
um so for example if you want to write a

1222
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,280
powershell script with a bunch of uh

1223
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,440
containment processes and execute them

1224
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
the ansible you can do that

1225
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,720
um it'll also let you uh interact with

1226
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,800
firewalls and network devices so

1227
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,400
if you want to add a rules to uh an asa

1228
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,319
firewall or you want to add rules to a

1229
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,440
palo alto device

1230
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,319
you can do that um and the other thing i

1231
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:50,560
i

1232
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,520
also mention here is mapping your things

1233
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,240
back to

1234
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,040
the attack framework that way you know

1235
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,079
you're coming up with

1236
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,440
containment playbooks that reflect

1237
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,280
uh real world uh adversary ttps

1238
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,040
um so at the end of the day you know

1239
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,160
when when you're building those

1240
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,440
playbooks you know that they're in

1241
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,119
response to

1242
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,960
the actual things that an attacker is

1243
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,480
going to do on your network

1244
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
and not just things that you as a blue

1245
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,240
teamer may think of right

1246
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,400
um and it's always being updated so

1247
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,680
you're you know you're

1248
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,599
you're you know when the solarwinds

1249
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,119
attack came out and you had to build

1250
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,800
containment against that

1251
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
you know you want to try to always uh

1252
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
build your containment against real

1253
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,520
world threats and

1254
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,119
uh and attacks right so with that

1255
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,520
uh i leave my uh my information up on

1256
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,240
the screen i

1257
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,599
i thank paul and they the great group i

1258
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,560
i so so wish that kova didn't exist and

1259
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,760
i would have been there in dublin with

1260
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,560
everybody

1261
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,680
uh because it would have been a great

1262
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,960
time but um if virtual is the way to go

1263
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,680
then

1264
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,720
i i'm more than happy to have done this

1265
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,680
and uh i'm pretty active on twitter um

1266
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,599
so if you want to follow me on twitter

1267
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,319
um as well as i do post quite a bit on

1268
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,119
my website

1269
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,520
in terms of um things that i'm thinking

1270
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,200
about and so on and so forth with

1271
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,440
regards to security so

1272
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,599
um with that i'm gonna hand it back over

1273
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,200
to uh to paul

1274
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,520
thank you so much peter great insight

1275
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,560
and

1276
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,240
definitely not something i'd ever

1277
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,680
thought of if you used an ansible in an

1278
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,280
incident response

1279
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,920
um scenario a couple of questions coming

1280
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,680
in from the audience uh particularly

1281
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,160
around

1282
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,839
soar platforms one question and i guess

1283
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,000
there may be hinting at the uh

1284
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,160
the gartner hype cycle sort of thing you

1285
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,040
know

1286
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,599
where potentially it might still be on

1287
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,520
that um

1288
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,599
you know towards the top towards the

1289
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,599
left of that cycle you know maybe peak

1290
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,920
of inflated expectations or

1291
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,680
you know do you think we're at that

1292
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,599
trough of disillusionment stage or do

1293
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,480
you think we're

1294
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,920
starting to edge into slope of

1295
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,839
enlightenment when it comes to

1296
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,200
solar platforms um uh yeah i think you

1297
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,880
know like i'm not

1298
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,560
you know like most the security people

1299
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,079
in this on the in this session here i

1300
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,720
mean

1301
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,319
you know a lot of it is it's great

1302
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,079
marketing uh and when you look at

1303
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,000
companies like um like i said like

1304
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,680
phantom and those companies

1305
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,240
that i think the thought was very could

1306
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,000
have been very different than what

1307
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,920
some of these bigger companies are

1308
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,200
making it into

1309
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,640
um that being said like you know i think

1310
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
soar has its value i think a lot of

1311
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,160
managed service providers are kind of

1312
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,000
using that as a as a really good selling

1313
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,079
tool um so so what i like to say is

1314
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,960
it's not necessarily sore it's the

1315
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
playbooks that are the key piece of it

1316
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,680
right

1317
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,000
so if soar provides the technology you

1318
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,880
need to actually

1319
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,760
execute those playbooks in a in a s in a

1320
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,280
speedy amount of time

1321
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,960
then then at the then at the end of the

1322
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,400
day that's great

1323
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,000
but as you can see here now again

1324
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,599
ansible is not perfect it was never

1325
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,960
developed to be a

1326
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,520
a an instant response tool but you can

1327
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,200
see you can do some pretty cool things

1328
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,240
with it

1329
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,200
um you know and and and i'm not saying

1330
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,640
you shouldn't be looking at a sore tool

1331
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,680
but i'm not saying you shouldn't be

1332
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,480
looking

1333
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,280
but like i said either or will work um i

1334
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
still think it's it is in the a bit of

1335
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,240
the hype stage

1336
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,560
um but i still think it is uh it is

1337
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,040
going to be valuable in the future

1338
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,119
and another question is you know how

1339
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,880
should companies get their response

1340
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,760
ready

1341
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,839
to engage early and get response times

1342
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,079
down you know you mentioned that 12-time

1343
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,200
and the containment

1344
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,480
sort of considerations and so the damage

1345
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,680
can be minimized

1346
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,880
and investigations carried out you know

1347
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,960
how how low can you get external

1348
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,560
engagements down

1349
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,760
from a third-party engagement when we're

1350
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,880
all remote at the minute

1351
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,800
i would well i in terms of the question

1352
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,480
about third parties what did you mean

1353
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,839
specifically about that

1354
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,839
well the the question as well as

1355
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,920
third-party engagement i'm guessing you

1356
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,480
know

1357
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,040
if you have vendor dependencies and from

1358
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,440
an incident response perspective

1359
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,280
right i mean i mean obviously you gotta

1360
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,880
hold your third parties accountable

1361
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,319
right at the end of the day you have to

1362
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,119
make sure that

1363
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,160
um you know it's i always i used to joke

1364
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,079
you know working for industry where i'd

1365
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,079
say you know if those third parties

1366
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,440
don't want to meet your security

1367
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,480
expectations make sure management um

1368
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,400
you you have the the authority to hit

1369
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,000
the big red button at the end of the day

1370
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,119
right so

1371
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,680
um you know the amount of third-party uh

1372
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,160
or

1373
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,520
you know third-party risk that's been

1374
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,480
brought on especially during covid

1375
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,560
um you know is is really big the other

1376
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,680
thing you can look at is if you have a

1377
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,040
really key third party and a great

1378
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,319
relationship with them

1379
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,400
you know build them as part of your

1380
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,760
response right

1381
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,599
you know share share the things you have

1382
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,839
with them like there's no reason why you

1383
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:38,720
can't uh

1384
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,839
if you have a good way of of containing

1385
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,440
there's no reason why you can't be doing

1386
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,200
that with that third party right

1387
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,720
but at the end of the day like i said

1388
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,319
you got to hold them accountable

1389
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,960
and and insurance cyber insurance is not

1390
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,560
necessarily what's going to save the day

1391
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,240
when it comes to this

1392
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,560
because you could still be left with a

1393
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,680
big mess to fig

1394
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,520
figure out even though you got to pay

1395
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,760
out from insurance right so

1396
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,119
so at the end of the day like i said

1397
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,880
it's important to hold them accountable

1398
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,599
include them in your process don't just

1399
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,880
assume that they are they know what

1400
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,400
they're doing

1401
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,359
and and treat them as i know it's gonna

1402
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,000
sound bad but

1403
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,160
treat them as a as a hostile network at

1404
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,000
the end of the day

1405
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,440
thank you very much peter i've been

1406
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:28,000
great insight
