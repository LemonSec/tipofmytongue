1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:06,799
so

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,040
uh yeah i'd like to uh thanks for having

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,639
me uh it's really weird

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,840
because uh besides dublin

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,960
uh last year uh in the before times

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,279
uh it actually became the first

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,400
conference

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,119
uh that broke my heart uh because i

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,400
couldn't travel

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,720
uh and i was like it was like yep we're

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,680
not gonna that's when

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,640
i started realizing my year was not

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,238
going to go as i planned

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,840
uh and i don't think anybody's here

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
wouldn't as they planned last year

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
uh and it's an ongoing dumpster fire so

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,680
therefore we're still having to work

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,559
with it

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,239
uh this talk um is a little strange

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,160
um it's like the reason why i chose the

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,920
kittens uh is because i always have

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,719
kittens

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,320
uh the reason why i have the t-shirt

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
it's gonna be obvious and the reason why

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
i chose that exact shirt is because uh

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
i'm probably gonna be doing a little bit

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,640
of flaming and i'm gonna probably get

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,920
some flames back and

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,680
i'm probably gonna like you know get

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,159
some heated discussions about this talk

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,439
uh because this was not a talk i planned

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,479
uh this was not uh if you'll notice

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,720
there's no there's no abstract that's

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,960
because it hasn't been written yet

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,520
i've literally just completed this talk

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,360
this was not the talk i'd planned for

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
this year

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,520
my talk this year was supposed to be um

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,040
was going to be

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
uh hacker striptease it's like because i

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,200
was supposed to be in person and on

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,759
stage

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,520
and i was going to go through and take

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
off all the different tools

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,960
all the different things that i used to

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,840
sneak into companies and break into them

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,720
but i realized uh around november and

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,399
december it's like it wasn't going to be

49
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,840
soon enough it's like i was still going

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,640
to have to be

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
doing virtual uh and that's an that i

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
didn't want to

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,920
start trying to do that and find a way

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
to do that virtually i want to do it for

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
on stage so it's going to be next year's

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,320
talk

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
and i was like what am i gonna talk

58
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
about well then luckily

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
uh some really crappy people did some

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,799
really crappy things

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
around christmas and that gave me

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
the the inspiration for this talk uh so

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,598
um what this talk is basically going to

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
be about it's going to be about

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,000
uh the stuff that we overlook it's like

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,640
we've got

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,680
i've looking at two problems and then

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,800
i'm going to try to find

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,720
uh i'm going to give my two solutions

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,959
for it uh so and we're gonna get into

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,239
that a little bit more

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,760
um this is

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,680
my bio page uh yeah um

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,040
hopefully there's some links it's like

75
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,800
i'm on twitter uh my website is

76
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,040
jcstreet.com

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,840
uh and if you are adventurous you can

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,200
google the rest

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,080
uh so uh i that that's the least

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
important slide in the deck

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,959
uh the key thing is um

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
these are my opinions it's like because

83
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,440
trust me i already got inflamed for this

84
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,239
discussion

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,120
okay for parts of it uh because people

86
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,319
didn't like some of the things i was

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
having to say about it and

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,720
i was like whatever uh this is how i i

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,840
feel about it but

90
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,959
it's only my opinion okay so

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,680
uh and i'm wrong on a lot of things uh

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,480
not on this

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
it's like if you're disagree on this i

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,760
think you're wrong but hey that's just

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,640
the way it is

96
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
uh but i but this is what it's about

97
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
it's like it's my discussion

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,519
what's going to be about so let's start

99
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
off uh

100
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,200
with the play on words of the title

101
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,480
i hate this t-shirt this is a crappy

102
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,599
t-shirt

103
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,560
this is a disrespectful t-shirt this is

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
a lame t-shirt

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
i own this t-shirt i used to wear this

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
t-shirt un ironically okay i was like

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,360
all

108
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
hipster wearing it right it's like

109
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
and it was wrong i didn't realize it was

110
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
wrong i didn't really think it through

111
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,519
it's like we evolve

112
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,159
we educate ourselves we grow i mean

113
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
that's really weird coming from me

114
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,959
saying something like growing up or

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,519
anything because

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,280
i had this i was growing up don't worry

117
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,640
that's not happening

118
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,959
it's like but we grow we educate the

119
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,840
gross people

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
and we learn but i remember wearing this

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,319
shirt i remember

122
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,080
all the jokes about uh there's no patch

123
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,439
for human stupidity that's why social

124
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
engineering's so easy

125
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,000
and i was like and i bought into that

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
for a while

127
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
and then i started learning how wrong i

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,279
was on that

129
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,960
and how toxic our industry has become

130
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
to users the ones that we're actually

131
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
supposed to be protecting

132
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,759
i mean we're supposed to be fighting for

133
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
the users and it's like and we

134
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,240
treat them like this

135
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,840
you thought the shirt was bad this chaps

136
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
my high

137
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
it's like if you get a little texted in

138
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
me it's like every time i see this

139
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
i've i'm livid about this uh comic

140
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,479
it's like in this corner we have

141
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,320
firewalls and kryptonite microsoft and

142
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,680
in this corner we have dave

143
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
you know human error it's like totally

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
trying to make information

145
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,880
security everybody's supposed to make it

146
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,000
look like that's the problem

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,320
the human is the problem the user the

148
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
person that you're supposed to be

149
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,320
protecting

150
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
is your problem i'm like what are you

151
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
talking about what it appears to me to

152
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,520
be the problem

153
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
is all that technology you don't know

154
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,880
how to use

155
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
you don't know how to implement you're

156
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,199
not properly uh putting in place

157
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,160
to protect your users maybe that's the

158
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,800
problem

159
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
maybe it's we've got to stop saying

160
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,560
stupid user clicked on a link

161
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,639
stupid user went to a website and

162
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,400
started saying stupid information

163
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,199
security

164
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,360
didn't properly train prepare their

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
users

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,759
stop getting technology to protect your

167
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,479
users

168
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,639
and start getting your users to protect

169
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,759
your technology

170
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,560
i hate this cartoon so much and have

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
complained about it so much

172
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,680
that my boss jason burns literally

173
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
contacted the artist of the comic strip

174
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,919
and had him redo it to make it

175
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,720
done properly that's your user

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,880
he is not a liability she is not someone

177
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
that you have to be

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
worried about they are someone that are

179
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
if you train them if you keep them

180
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,479
properly informed

181
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,000
and let them know that they're part of

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
your team from day one

183
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,960
they're your biggest ally they're one of

184
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,000
your best assets

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,520
they're the best nutrition detection

186
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,039
system you're ever going to have

187
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,479
but we don't properly train them we

188
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,560
don't properly educate them on that

189
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
and that's our failing not theirs

190
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,600
they will do what is required for them

191
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
to keep and and

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
uh uh get a paycheck keep their job and

193
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,280
get a paycheck

194
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
we're not telling them that's part of

195
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,039
the responsibility so they don't have to

196
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,039
worry about it

197
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
but let's uh we're gonna we're gonna

198
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
circle back to that in a little bit

199
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
but let's start off with the first

200
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
problem offensive teams

201
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
don't have to be so offensive it's like

202
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,800
and straight out

203
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
it's like and what i'm getting with this

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,919
is

205
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,599
and i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna talk

206
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,440
about it in in depth because

207
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,479
it just really irritates me so much

208
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,199
red teams what are their functions right

209
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
what what is a red team function i

210
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
hear and and i mean i hear so many

211
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,240
people come up to say hey i want to be a

212
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,520
red teamer

213
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
oh i want to i want to be here i want to

214
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
be a i want to be on the red team jason

215
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,560
it's like how do i do what you do

216
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
you know like first of all i don't do

217
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,199
wretched but whatever it's like that's a

218
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,560
different story it's like

219
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
it's like they want to be and i said why

220
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,599
do you want to do this like because i

221
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,560
want to break stuff

222
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,319
it's like i'm going to break in on me

223
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,440
then you're useless

224
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
if you think red teaming is about

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
breaking into networks

226
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,960
then you don't understand the job

227
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,919
red team only exists as a function

228
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,960
is to make the blue team better

229
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,479
their job is there to help

230
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,440
the blue team not show them how they got

231
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,720
pwned

232
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
not to like you know walk in and show

233
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,720
them what they did wrong

234
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,360
it is to make them better and more

235
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
secure

236
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,039
they're there only as a function

237
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,720
for the blue team for their clients

238
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
but we've turned like red team being

239
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
sexy or it's like you know like rock

240
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
stars in the red team

241
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,360
it's like where did we get that

242
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,520
you want to know what i mean further

243
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,960
there's no rockstar there's like we're

244
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,000
freaking dentist

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,479
of the internet here it's like but but

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,519
the people that deserve a lot of credit

247
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,279
are the blue teamers the ones that are

248
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,719
doing that day job

249
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,599
in and day in and day out manning the

250
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,120
firewalls creating the intrusion

251
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
detection system rules

252
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,839
working non-stop when an incident occurs

253
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
when a new vulnerability is out and

254
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
all the systems have to be patched

255
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,279
before they get compromised

256
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,800
or responding after they've been

257
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
compromised that's work

258
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,120
going in and knocking down your legos

259
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,399
and saying ha ha

260
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,560
should i fix that doesn't impress me

261
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,399
get the work done i'm so tired

262
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,680
of red teamers acting like their job

263
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
is to kick people when they're down you

264
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
know

265
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,680
this irritates the crap of me this is to

266
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,240
me

267
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
what i see a lot of red teamers probably

268
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,320
wearing on the on the weekend

269
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,640
you know you know one thing that all

270
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,320
these uh these three people have in

271
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,279
common

272
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,040
probably never been in a real effing

273
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
fight it's like

274
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,839
i've learned one thing over the years

275
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
and the decades that i've been if i used

276
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,959
to be homeless

277
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,120
it's like i used to live on the street i

278
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,839
i i've had some scraps

279
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,839
and i never had to wear a shirt to show

280
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,240
someone how tough i was

281
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,640
i never had it i didn't want people to

282
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
know how tough i was i didn't

283
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,040
want to look threatening i didn't want

284
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
to be seen as a threat

285
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
it's like there's a good rapper you know

286
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
real killers move in silence

287
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,399
there's a lot of loud talkers we got in

288
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,839
this industry

289
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,360
trying to act tough trying to like

290
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
overcompensate for something

291
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,839
acting like they're the the king all of

292
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,079
breaking in and destroying stuff

293
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,000
when they should be talking about how

294
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
they help and how they help

295
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,240
networks and help companies better

296
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
protect themselves

297
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
it's like we get this attitude where

298
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
it's so

299
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,480
offensive where it's like we're so on

300
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,360
edge and we're so

301
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,320
edgy and we're so and we've turned red

302
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,200
team into a

303
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
like some kind of fetish little like you

304
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
know icon of like you know that's what

305
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,440
you got to be

306
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
that's your ultimate goal is to

307
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,800
eventually be on the red team

308
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
to eventually be on the offensive side

309
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
security because blue teams are for

310
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,000
suckers

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
and it's like i built networks

312
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,399
it's like at banks it's like and i've i

313
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,240
loved it as a blue team

314
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
that was one of my best jobs like that

315
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,600
was amazing because

316
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,839
i would create defenses and i would be

317
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,240
able to detect when a bad guy came in

318
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
when a criminal gets on my network like

319
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
huh mother i knew you'd try that because

320
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,560
that's what i

321
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,320
do and by the way that's why you're

322
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,839
being logged and that's why you're being

323
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,560
reported

324
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
and that's why you're being blocked have

325
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,800
fun in jail talk to you later we're fdic

326
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,360
insured

327
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,600
that's a felony mother you're going down

328
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,279
right i love that

329
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,640
that's fun so so

330
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,560
miss me with that noise about you know

331
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
red team being the ultimate

332
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
it's like that's not the ultimate doing

333
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
what you love is the ultimate

334
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
doing what helps others is the ultimate

335
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
it's like it doesn't matter

336
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,040
what you know virtual side you are

337
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,160
because there is no

338
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,519
side there is no red team versus blue

339
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:37,920
team

340
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
look red team works for the blue team

341
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
so there is no side

342
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,440
so and i mean and one of the things that

343
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
gets me and it's always bugged me

344
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040
and i've never really talked about it

345
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,639
but it's like i i gotta call it out

346
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,600
because it's like

347
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,519
and this is a saying that i've heard

348
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,959
from so many people

349
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,240
it is so pervasive in our industry

350
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
this quote everyone has a plan until

351
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
they get punched in the face

352
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,720
that sounds dangerous

353
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
that sounds tough oh my gosh

354
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,639
well first of all i don't take advice

355
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,440
from convicted rapist who went to prison

356
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
for it

357
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,760
who then gets out does some more boxing

358
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,200
and then when they start getting punched

359
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,600
in the face their plan of action

360
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,880
was to bite the guy on the ear sorry

361
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,360
not he's not my life coach i'm not

362
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
getting advice from that dude

363
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,160
so i i can't help it it's ridiculous

364
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
and also you think mike tyson was smart

365
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,760
enough to come up with that plan

366
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
that's not even original thought that's

367
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
not even an original thought from him

368
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,240
he stole this from this guy

369
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
you see the next slide because i don't

370
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,399
see the next slide

371
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
there we go okay he stole the quote

372
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,399
from this guy no battle plan

373
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,680
ever survives contact with the enemy

374
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
helmet von multiver the elder was a

375
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
prussian general

376
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,480
born october 26 1800 it's like uh

377
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,079
that was the original plan and you know

378
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,600
what that whole thing was

379
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,639
the whole root of that quote it wasn't

380
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,800
to show how bad the red team was going

381
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,440
to be

382
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,880
and how the offensive team was going to

383
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
come in and kick butt and take names

384
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
it was a warning to red teams that once

385
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
you go in

386
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,160
and start conducting your battle guess

387
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
what you're gonna be surprised

388
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,480
with what the defenses are by what

389
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,639
occurs on the battlefield

390
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,000
this was made to warn people who were

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
doing offensive attacks not for the

392
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
defenders

393
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,760
this wasn't for the defense side and

394
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
stuff this was a warning

395
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,279
for the people who were doing the

396
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,120
offensive attack

397
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
it's like and so of course it got

398
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,480
bastardized by tyson

399
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,519
it's like it turned into a t-shirt and a

400
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,959
a nice cool saying but the reason why i

401
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,560
bring that up

402
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,079
because i'm not cast in shape the reason

403
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,160
why i bring that is this whole attitude

404
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,279
of negativity and

405
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,040
offensive and aggressive attitude

406
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,320
of red teamers has a worse problem

407
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,199
it has bled off into the blue team

408
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,000
this attitude that we have to it that

409
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,959
the red team

410
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,600
has to attack the blue team show them no

411
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,320
mercy

412
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,560
totally pone them so they get like you

413
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,399
know hey we got it we got to win we

414
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,120
broke them

415
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
it's like well guess what when you abuse

416
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
someone

417
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
it's like they find someone else to

418
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
abuse

419
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,120
it's like it's a vicious cycle that's

420
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,279
very hard to break that we need to break

421
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,560
in this community

422
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
because now the blue teams are like

423
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
crap it's like they totally destroyed

424
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,800
you know what

425
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
i i blame the users on this

426
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,519
i've got to break them i got to use the

427
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,839
same attacks that they were using on me

428
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,199
that the red team used to be i'm going

429
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,959
to use them on my users and show them

430
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,560
where they failed

431
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,839
i'm going to show where it's like the

432
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,440
user's problem for clicking links and

433
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,320
going on things

434
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,639
it wasn't my fault my network network

435
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,600
was doing great

436
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,480
why am i getting trouble for that and so

437
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
they bring it

438
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,040
to the users they turn that if they

439
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,759
and they start justifying themselves

440
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,360
well we're just trying to use the same

441
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
things that attacker uses

442
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,399
we're still trying to do what you know

443
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,839
how how that works

444
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,759
bs it's like you see

445
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,160
how the red teamers act and you want to

446
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,680
be like them and you want to act like

447
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,160
them

448
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,480
and you take it out on the users and

449
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,759
stuff you know because they don't have a

450
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,320
say in this

451
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,440
case in point and the origination

452
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,959
of this talk christmas

453
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,000
2020 i mean let's face it

454
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
the whole year was an effing dumpster

455
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,160
fire it's like if you think the pandemic

456
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,279
was was a problem

457
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,839
it's like i mean come on where were you

458
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,680
it's like we still had murder hornets to

459
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,240
deal with

460
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
right it's like i mean there's all kinds

461
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,399
of things going on in 2020

462
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,920
it's like i can tell you that there was

463
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,600
a lot of shell shock and it's hard to

464
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,399
keep up

465
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,040
with every single pathetic horrible

466
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,639
thing that happened

467
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,959
but one of the things that did it that

468
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,279
sort of hit the top of the radar for me

469
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,759
and should have hit in this industry was

470
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,399
freaking

471
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,399
go daddy oh i'm calling him out thank

472
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,839
goodness you're not a sponsor

473
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,320
didn't matter it's like but you know at

474
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,600
least it's a little bit less awkward

475
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,320
right

476
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
these efforts decide to go and say hey

477
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,240
during the middle of a pandemic when

478
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,839
people still don't know how they're

479
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,480
going to

480
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
feed their children to the rest of it

481
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,839
who are trying to also

482
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
be teachers now while they work from

483
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
home

484
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,720
not knowing if they're gonna have enough

485
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,959
money for rent not even for their house

486
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
it's like over anything else

487
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
it's like let's tell them that they're

488
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,079
going to get

489
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,559
a bonus a christmas bonus

490
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,000
mother scrooge looked at him scrooge was

491
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,319
in his grave one damn that's cold

492
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,799
i mean seriously how can you do that

493
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,760
and do you know what i kept hearing from

494
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,160
the

495
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,799
information security community from red

496
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,000
teamers

497
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,120
made me sick was

498
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,240
that's what an attacker would do

499
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,280
it's just a real world adversarial

500
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
simulation because a criminal would do

501
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
that that fish jason

502
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,799
why are you so upset with that you seem

503
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,160
a little ranty right now

504
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,400
it's like you shouldn't be so upset but

505
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
because

506
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,880
it is wrong you know i do

507
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
active simulations and attacking

508
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,720
simulations i have done some

509
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
horrible fish i've used the murder of

510
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
children in my

511
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
fishes as demonstrations

512
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
never once have i sent an email

513
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,160
out to a person that unduly made them

514
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,880
stressed

515
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
influenced or got their hopes up that

516
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
they wouldn't get it

517
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
it's like that is wrong they are great

518
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
for demonstrations

519
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
for showing people how bad it can be

520
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
that's how you do that

521
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,880
you show the executives these are some

522
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,720
of the case scenarios of what kind of

523
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
emails you could send out to someone

524
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,200
and how horrible they can be definitely

525
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,039
give them those kind of demonstrations

526
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,919
you don't send those to the end users

527
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,480
it's like

528
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,520
you know i've used a a

529
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
badge reader to clone id badges to get

530
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
into a building

531
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,720
that's an active attack but you know

532
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,480
what else would be a good attack

533
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,320
you know if i really wanted to do a good

534
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
real world scenario

535
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
it's like and i'm a criminal and i'm

536
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
doing an attacker simulation

537
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,240
mother why am i not going up to the guy

538
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,919
when he's going into the parking garage

539
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,360
putting a gun to his head

540
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
and saying give me your badge and get in

541
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,640
the trunk your car because i need to use

542
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,000
your id to go rob your place

543
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that's a little extreme jason you think

544
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,200
it's what an attacker would do i could

545
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,760
see a criminal doing that

546
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,600
it's like i mean i've seen that in

547
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,799
several different you know

548
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
movies it's like so it's got to be real

549
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,799
right we got to do the stuff that an

550
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,720
attacker does

551
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
so why aren't we doing that it's like i

552
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
need to get into the building

553
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,400
why won't the client let me use

554
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,360
explosives

555
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,919
to get through the wall it's what an

556
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,679
attacker would do

557
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,160
that's stupid and it sounds stupid

558
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,799
saying it

559
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,280
it's even more stupid to do things like

560
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,120
this

561
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
but don't worry don't worry it's like

562
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,640
everybody thought like that's 2020 jason

563
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,160
is 20 21 now

564
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,799
oh no it's still the dumpster fire still

565
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,480
going

566
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,799
it's like we've added some sparklers and

567
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,320
some like pretty fireworks every once in

568
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,159
a while they'll go off and go oh that's

569
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:04,720
nice

570
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,280
and then more dumpster fire okay it's

571
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
still a dumpster fire

572
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,000
this librarian actually said friend

573
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,960

you get their hopes up you crush them

620
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,919
you ground them down

621
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,400
you tell them uh things like this you

622
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,200
treat them

623
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,440
as suspects you treat them as enemies

624
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
you treat them as enemy combatants

625
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,320
you treat them as untrusted you do not

626
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,760
treat them as allies do not treat them

627
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,559

and congratulations you've got just some

629
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
disgruntled employees

630
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
do you think the only people that were

631
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
upset about those emails

632
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,440
were the ones that clicked the link

633
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,960
every employee after they

634
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,559
heard that was upset

635
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,840
you your threat uh

636
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,799
pool increased dramatically that day for

637
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,080
both those companies

638
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,400
horrendous they're bad and they should

639
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,320
feel bad about it

640
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,679
because that's not what you do so it's

641
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,240
like you're not helping your situation

642
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
so you got to understand the the red

643
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,760
teamers

644
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,159
the pin testers once they're done with

645
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,520
the engagement

646
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,320
they're gone poof like the winds you

647
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,960
know

648
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,559
they ride off in the sunset because

649
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,400
they're cool probably on a chopper and

650
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
stuff you know it's like oh like

651
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,360
because that's how they imagine

652
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,400
themselves i'm sure with the wind

653
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
blowing foo you know

654
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,840
bullcrap okay they're gone who picks up

655
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
the pieces

656
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,120
the client the employer they have to now

657
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,159
start working

658
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,280
and making sure that those uh flaws are

659
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,080
corrected

660
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,559
but also confidence is restored because

661
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,240
the the regulators aren't caring

662
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,440
about what actually gets done or who got

663
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,320
hurt

664
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,720
and i'm not saying it before anybody

665
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,840
starts hashtagging me

666
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,720
not all red teamers okay it's like i'm

667
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,880
not saying all red teamers okay so screw

668
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,240
that

669
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,480
it's like but the majority of what i've

670
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,440
seen

671
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,600
it has been like that and i'm tired of

672
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,559
it

673
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,279
i'm tired of just not fixing the problem

674
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,640
so solution number one

675
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,480
because i come with solutions it's like

676
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,840
i'm not one of those speakers who likes

677
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,320
to say

678
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,240
look how much i broke this i don't know

679
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,559
how to fix it but i broke it really good

680
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,159
it's like because like i said i'm not a

681
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,080
red teamer it's like so

682
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,840
um you got to learn to lose

683
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,279
so the clients can learn to win and very

684
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,080
simple

685
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,120
and let me and let me break it down it's

686
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
like

687
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,159
um i've made that mistake before

688
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,440
it's like i have done this

689
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,159
it's like i hate hypocrites the most and

690
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,159
i get hypocritical sometimes

691
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,039
uh but i try not to as much as possible

692
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,840
i

693
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,480
have done this i everything that i

694
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,440
talked about

695
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,200
bad about a red teamer with the attitude

696
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,799
with the approach i have done

697
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,120
it's like i have broken into places and

698
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,919
just gone

699
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,120
hey this is oh man that is like bad it's

700
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,440
like i have broken in badly it's like i

701
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,159
have

702
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,360
done things that have upset people i i

703
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
promise people uh that i mean i i was

704
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,720
like

705
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
there was like once again it was on the

706
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,919
spur of the moment i tell the bank

707
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,039
manager i was going to give them all

708
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,000
this equipment

709
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,279
and i had to tell them no all right

710
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,200
i've told people it's oh this is what's

711
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
going to happen and i've disappointed

712
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,520
them

713
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,919
it's like so i have done that but the

714
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,000
most important thing i realized

715
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,799
i was doing that was hurting them the

716
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,840
most

717
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,360
was i wasn't giving them

718
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,640
a win i was just

719
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,080
kicking him i kicked him some more

720
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,480
and i'm like oh you look a little down

721
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
wait hold on i got something for you

722
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,120
another kick and it's like

723
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,159
and that was because i thought that's

724
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:42,480
what

725
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
my job was i thought my job was to punch

726
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,240
people in faces and see if they had a

727
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
plan

728
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,080
i didn't realize people not may not

729
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,240
react kindly to that

730
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,360
i didn't realize you know not everybody

731
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,679
likes

732
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
you going into their company and saying

733
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
how ugly their baby is

734
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,200
that's i mean and i've seen some pretty

735
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
ugly babies

736
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,120
but people may not respond to that

737
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
properly

738
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,679
all the best intentions so

739
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,240
i learned something it was on this one

740
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,600
job

741
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,240
where i learned the importance

742
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,600
of giving them a win where it's like i

743
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,080
had a

744
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,159
choice where i could have left after i

745
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,640
successfully compromised their location

746
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,039
i could have left but i saw the employee

747
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,320
down the hallway who

748
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,520
who had let me in the door who messed up

749
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,559
who failed and let me in the door but i

750
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,400
saw the looks on her face

751
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,880
i saw her talking to another employee

752
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
they were discussing me

753
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,000
she knew she made a mistake she was

754
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,520
trying to correct it

755
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,279
and i could have left and made the win

756
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,480
red team once again score

757
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,320
or i could keep going

758
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,520
and let them catch me

759
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,240
i could let them fix their mistake

760
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,440
and catch me and that changed

761
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,039
my whole life and my whole outlook

762
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,960
on how to do red teaming and that's the

763
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,520
reason why i don't red team anymore

764
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,760
i am a security awareness operative it's

765
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,039
like someone from uh

766
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,320
hacking the box gave me that and i

767
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,919
appreciate it it's like that's what i

768
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,760
call myself now i am a security

769
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
awareness operative

770
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,240
i do security awareness engagements

771
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,799
i'm there to teach employees the i do a

772
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,640
three-day engagement

773
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,960
the first day is mostly recon maybe some

774
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,679
light you know

775
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,440
breaking in or some light looking around

776
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,720
see what i can get into

777
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,440
causing some mischief day two i am the

778
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,919
worst

779
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,679
possible thing to happen to you at the

780
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,000
worst possible time the worst possible

781
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
way it's like i'm great at parties i

782
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,120
just go in and i try to tear you up

783
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,000
and then on the third day i get caught

784
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,880
the third day i work at it i mean trust

785
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,000
me i've had to work at

786
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
it but i will get caught by your

787
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,720
employees

788
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,399
because i will not just give them

789
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,840
something to look down on

790
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,480
i will give them something to look up to

791
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,679
on the second day

792
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,480
after every engagement i wait for about

793
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,279
two minutes

794
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,679
and then i come back in and i talk to

795
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,039
every single person

796
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,360
i don't fill out a report i don't write

797
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,200
a report and give them a memo for three

798
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,159
months later

799
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,039
i educate them right then and there and

800
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,640
that takes time

801
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,279
and that takes effort because people

802
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,360
don't like hearing what you just did

803
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,559
in the moment but you have to let them

804
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,039
know

805
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,120
hey you did this

806
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,559
this was wrong i'm a bad guy i was doing

807
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,320
bad things

808
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,200
now you know the next time someone like

809
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,080
me comes in

810
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,399
it's not going to be me but they try to

811
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,159
do stuff like that

812
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,200
now you know that's bad i shouldn't do

813
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,159
that

814
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,919
do you have the number to contact for

815
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,760
security so you can contact them the

816
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,440
next time something like that happens

817
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,960
do you know what to do the next time you

818
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,880
see someone that's suspicious

819
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,720
good because that's what you needed to

820
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,320
know that's what you need to learn

821
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
the company hired me not to file a

822
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,799
report on what you did wrong

823
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,840
my your company hired me to educate you

824
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,679
and give you a training exercise

825
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,399
so you would be better prepared for if a

826
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,880
real attack happened

827
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,200
just that conversation alone

828
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
will create allies in your

829
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
infrastructure

830
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,120
it'll create people that feel like

831
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,480
they're you're trying to help

832
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
empower them and educate them and make

833
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,799
them better at their job

834
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,960
instead of someone trying to break

835
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,039
something and get a gotcha

836
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,360
and just show a finding that that they

837
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
failed on

838
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,039
and trust me they get pissed

839
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,640
i had one lady who after i told them

840
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,960
and i already talked to the the the

841
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,679
client i

842
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,440
i talked to the the person to my point

843
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,520
of contact i talked to the head of their

844
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:05,919
i.t

845
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,760
department who i was like after the

846
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
compromise and explained and then i went

847
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,000
back and started doing the education

848
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,919
to all the employees that i compromised

849
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,520
i came across this one way she's like

850
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,440
i'm calling the police

851
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,880
and i'm like huh so oh you're not

852
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,000
supposed to be here i'm going

853
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
no no no i wasn't supposed to be here

854
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,120
before

855
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,880
but i'm supposed to be here now i will

856
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,480
show you no no i'm gonna call

857
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
i'm like it doesn't work like that

858
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,399
you're just being a sore loser at this

859
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,520
point it's like

860
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,000
i've already won i'm just letting you

861
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
know the game's over

862
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,399
you can't you can't do call backsies

863
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,720
it's it doesn't work that way that's not

864
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
how this works not any of this works

865
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,120
so i've had situations where they've

866
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,799
been very upset

867
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,919
but if any social engineer worth their

868
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:52,480
weight

869
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,440
uh insult it's like should be able to at

870
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,279
least social engineer themselves out of

871
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:57,760
that

872
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,200
they should be at least a social

873
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,120
engineer the employees that they've

874
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,080
compromised

875
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,480
into feeling better about the engagement

876
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,120
it's like because that's some real work

877
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,440
anybody can walk into a building and

878
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,559
plug in a usb

879
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,799
drive or tell people they're with it and

880
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,159
they need to do an audit

881
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,399
i'm i know everybody can do that because

882
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,640
i do that and if i can do it anybody can

883
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,600
okay i am not sophisticated any way

884
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,640
shape or form

885
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
it's like ask anybody you've seen me eat

886
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,840
it's like i am not a sophisticated

887
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,720
person

888
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,640
it's like so you got to understand

889
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,320
that that's the main part of your job

890
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,600
is to educate the users to educate the

891
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,440
employees on what their

892
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,919
failings were and how to improve on it

893
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,360
so solution two it leads right into it

894
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,440
we have to start educating and

895
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
empowering your employees

896
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,000
plus enforcing the actual policies that

897
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,559
help

898
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,159
i've literally got this article on on

899
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,679
this if you want to look at it about the

900
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,320
three e's

901
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,000
it's like trust me i've been harping on

902
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
this for a decade or more

903
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,080
it's like this is very important that we

904
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,880
need to get

905
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,440
doing more in our environment the first

906
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,919
one

907
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,880
is educating you cannot

908
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,679
educate your employees with a quarterly

909
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,960
little seminar

910
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,279
or video or something telling them about

911
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,960
what their policies are your computer

912
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
policies are

913
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,279
that doesn't work they need to know on

914
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,399
day one of orientation

915
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,439
that guess what

916
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,720
your job responsibilities are what we

917
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
hired you for this this and this

918
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,080
and also securing your equipment

919
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,240
you're responsible for securing your

920
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,120
equipment

921
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,399
to making sure you secure your email

922
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,440
communications

923
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,159
by not clicking unknown links by not

924
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,320
going to unknown websites

925
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,880
to maintaining security on your

926
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,600
equipment

927
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,360
that the company is giving you that is

928
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,919
company equipment you're responsible for

929
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,640
give them the responsibility let them

930
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,519
understand

931
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,720
the gravity of that situation

932
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,440
and guess what they're still not going

933
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,000
to care about

934
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,039
your data but they're going to know

935
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,960
that they'll lose their job if they

936
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
don't

937
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,440
they'll start understanding that that is

938
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,679
always been a responsibility of theirs

939
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,080
it's not an afterthought it's not

940
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,600
something that's been tacked on

941
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,960
afterwards

942
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,720
because if we're not training them

943
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,120
immediately what to do

944
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,000
on day one and how to secure themselves

945
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,440
and how to report

946
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,640
the problems then we can't get mad when

947
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,159
they keep getting compromised

948
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,760
and we need to start empowering them we

949
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,159
need

950
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,039
we can't just educate them we need to

951
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,799
get them involved

952
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,039
it's like i do i've done talks i've done

953
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,480
training classes on how to create

954
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,240
security awareness programs

955
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,760
and one of the biggest things that

956
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,519
companies can do

957
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,159
is to actually get your employees

958
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,200
involved

959
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,159
in your information security program in

960
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,279
a fun way

961
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,480
because security ain't fun i mean for me

962
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,000
it's a blast but you know for most

963
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,839
people it's not fun

964
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,918
it's like so you've got to show bob and

965
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,040
accounting

966
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,000
what's in it for him and the best way to

967
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,440
do that

968
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,280
is to actually get them involved say hey

969
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,760
company-wide every quarter we're giving

970
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,599
out a thousand dollars

971
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,119
you know which is about 50 euros or

972
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,239
something i don't know but we're giving

973
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,760
out a thousand dollars

974
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
it's like uh every quarter in a drawing

975
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,839
amazon gift card whatever you know uh

976
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,280
just whatever kind of card

977
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,079
and and you do that and that way your

978
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,239
budget doesn't change

979
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,679
it's going to be a thousand dollars

980
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,000
every quarter but the people you

981
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,839
participate that get involved in the

982
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,359
raffle

983
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,720
will increase and you do it very simply

984
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,280
if you report a suspicious email one

985
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,880
entry into the drawing

986
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,680
at that suspicious email turned out to

987
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,880
be

988
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,400
a actual fish you get 20

989
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,800
entries you stop someone at the gate

990
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,480
because they don't have their badge

991
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,800
that's 10 points it doesn't matter come

992
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,160
up with your own rules

993
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,359
but make it a competition because

994
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,680
guess what your employees still don't

995
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
care about your data

996
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
but that's that thousand dollars is a

997
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
thousand dollars right

998
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,839
you know it's like that that's something

999
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,079
they care about that

1000
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,160
they care about getting that entry into

1001
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,079

1002
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,240

1004
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,240
stop making it like it's extra work for

1005
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
them make it where it's a part of their

1006
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,680
job responsibility

1007
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,119
and hey there might be a bonus involved

1008
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,599
that's how you empower your employees

1009
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,640
and then also

1010
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,200
another little flame war that i started

1011
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,280
was because yes

1012
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,800
jason was seen in a talk saying that you

1013
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,000
should fire people

1014
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,880
that clicked on a link yeah

1015
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,079
if you have a delivery driver who totals

1016
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,880
your 70

1017
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,320
000 van you might give them a talking to

1018
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,520
if they crash your van three times

1019
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
seriously you know they're not your

1020
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,480
still employee after the first one

1021
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,079
so that's what you have to do with

1022
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,520
phishing

1023
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,640
someone clicks a link

1024
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,280
on a suspicious email and goes somewhere

1025
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,560
they're not supposed to

1026
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,720
and causes an incident write them up

1027
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,760
take them to a specialized intense

1028
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,240
class specifically where it's a

1029
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,760
one-on-one with another security

1030
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,560
professional

1031
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,440
and the the person the guilty party and

1032
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
give them the class on

1033
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
why they need to take email security

1034
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
more seriously

1035
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,880
the second email they click oh

1036
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,359
they get another talking to they get

1037
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,000
another

1038
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,599
class but then they get restrictions on

1039
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,960
their email

1040
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,880
then they get maybe monitoring software

1041
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,400
put on their email

1042
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
saying it's like hey we're going to use

1043
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
it sorry but this is a probationary

1044
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,839
period for the next three months

1045
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,280
we're going to have to monitor this we

1046
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
can't trust you with the emails you're

1047
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,440
clicking them

1048
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,599
show them there's repercussions to it

1049
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,040
and on the third time

1050
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,720
that they click the link that's a

1051
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,960
malicious they're gone

1052
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,240
fire we fire employees

1053
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,440
over less employees

1054
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,079
clicking the link can cost 300 million

1055
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,560
dollars

1056
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,320
ask target wasn't even their company

1057
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,400
it was the hvac company guy clicked on a

1058
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,440
link

1059
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,320
cost him over 300 million dollars that's

1060
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,920
a lot of vans

1061
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,520
there's a lot of crashed vans right

1062
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,119
there

1063
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,839
is that employee still working there

1064
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,200
maybe

1065
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,599
because it was just an email just click

1066
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,760
on an email

1067
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,800
so we need to start doing better with

1068
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,160
that

1069
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,040
and one important thing one important

1070
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,240
thing that we have to get through more

1071
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,200
than anything else

1072
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,760
is there is a pass for human stupidity

1073
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,800
it's called education and people who say

1074
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,839
otherwise

1075
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,160
are stupid so miss me with that noise

1076
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,760
okay because i'm tired of hearing it

1077
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,359
it's like if you're constantly

1078
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,920
going into a company and you're getting

1079
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,680
you're going in with the same exploit

1080
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
and i've heard red teamers brag

1081
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,640
like oh my gosh i broke into this one

1082
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,359
company

1083
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,839
oh yeah

1084
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,520
same exploit i used the same ex boy from

1085
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,800
last year

1086
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,440
and i got in isn't that hilarious no

1087
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,839
you're pathetic

1088
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,640
okay it's like that means you were such

1089
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,560
a lousy job

1090
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,880
of talking to your client and explaining

1091
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,320
to them what the threats were

1092
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,280
and what the risks were that you allowed

1093
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,800
them to get compromised with the same

1094
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,680
exploit

1095
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,880
you should be ashamed of yourself

1096
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,160
one of the best jobs i've ever done

1097
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,680

1105
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,280
from the

1106
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,400
week the year before no they didn't

1107
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,880
i changed my look up i changed i was in

1108
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,760
disguises

1109
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,079
i was like inspector clouseau but no uh

1110
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,839
but no i wouldn't disguise this and

1111
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:50,640
everything

1112
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,240
it's like not very good ones because you

1113
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,720
know i'm on a budget but still

1114
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,400
this was an employee who'd never seen me

1115
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,520
before stop me out of the gate

1116
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,240
i was so impressed i still compromised

1117
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,520
the the client i still

1118
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
gave them value i still showed them some

1119
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,920
flaws they needed to work on

1120
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,800
but man every section i went to

1121
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,119
i eventually had an employee who said no

1122
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,280
i don't know who you are i'm gonna have

1123
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,560
to talk to security

1124
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,319
i need to talk to the i.t department

1125
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,720
who's your supervisor uh no you're not

1126
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,240
allowed to touch my computer

1127
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,319
unless there's been an email or i've

1128
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,160
been notified that you were coming and i

1129
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,119
haven't been

1130
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,119
so i can't help you i was

1131
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,040
it literally it's still good it was one

1132
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,319
of the best i was

1133
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,720
i was like a school kid i was so effing

1134
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,079
happy

1135
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,720
i mean and this wasn't me trying to fail

1136
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,599
this wasn't

1137
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,960
me trying to give them a win things

1138
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,480
were winning they were

1139
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,960
doing their job because i taught them

1140
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,960
i gave them a lesson the year before

1141
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,000
i showed them what all that did

1142
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,119
was verify that i did a good job the

1143
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,000
year before

1144
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,560
and this and also a good job on them

1145
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,760
because they deserve credit

1146
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,520
because they took it seriously and the

1147
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,960
management worked with it

1148
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,200
and took those findings and they

1149
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,079
implemented

1150
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,400
the suggestions and they kept continued

1151
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,560
educating their employees

1152
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,359
that's a win not going back the same

1153
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,160
next year and

1154
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
and getting with the same exploit that's

1155
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,720
pathetic

1156
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,319
so i told you cats with laser eyes

1157
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,079
i was burning stuff down but you know

1158
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,160
here's where we get that what's a

1159
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,119
virtual so we're going to get

1160
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,720
comfortable uncomfortable mental silence

1161
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,118
anyway

1162
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,240
that's to let you know i'm just done

1163
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,920
any questions anybody want to you know

1164
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,680
start with the screaming at me or you

1165
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,960

1166
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640

1167
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,240

1168
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,760
so you know go for it so um

1169
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,960
guys anybody watching this stream on

1170
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,000
swap card on the bottom right of your

1171
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,560
screen there is a live discussion tab

1172
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,520
and

1173
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
you can open that up go into the

1174
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,800
questions section and throw in any

1175
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,240
questions you have

1176
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
uh until questions are coming true

1177
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,359
actually uh

1178
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,079
jason we had a discussion like a little

1179
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:26,800
chat going

1180
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,560
um on the on swap card

1181
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,720
and there are so many people who

1182
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,319
resonate with what you're saying

1183
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,599
um there was basically discussion saying

1184
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,920
um there seems to be like this macho

1185
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,800
attitude for

1186
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,760
red teamers which doesn't really work

1187
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,040
and

1188
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,119
one of the people watching your talk

1189
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,319
there was saying

1190
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,520
he really prefers to be an advocate for

1191
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,800
doing things right he

1192
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,560
is a red teamer and he most prefers

1193
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,640
the feeling of finding something that's

1194
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,560
gone wrong and actually going to the

1195
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,920
people who are supporting the

1196
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,200
application or

1197
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,960
system whatever that might be and

1198
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,480
actually help them

1199
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,800
secure that and that's absolutely the

1200
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,319
way to go and this is how you make

1201
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,200
allies

1202
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,240
and and gonna embed the security mindset

1203
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,839
to the other teams

1204
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,359
uh rather than being the person who's

1205
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,560
out to get them that really doesn't work

1206
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,920
and when you talk about matcha that

1207
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,440
that's one of the things that that's one

1208
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,040
of the funniest things about the whole

1209
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,560
freaking red team mystique

1210
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,200
because you know why you want to know

1211
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,880
the top five

1212
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,079
best red teamers out there all women

1213
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,520
it's like you want to know some real

1214
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,119
good red teamers it's like you know if

1215
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,319
you want someone that's going to be able

1216
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:38,800
to bring

1217
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,560
get a woman on your team okay because

1218
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,319
men are so short-sighted and so

1219
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,839
narrow-minded and stuff you know it's

1220
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,359
like they're usually pretty quick and

1221
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,240
like you know

1222
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,720
circumventing any kind of control it's

1223
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,680
like and

1224
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,359
they're good at their jobs it's like

1225
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,800
they're good at the tech

1226
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,200
they're good at social engineering and

1227
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,720
they're good at breaking into places

1228
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,480
it's like trust me it's like

1229
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,800
i i can do it pretty over just like

1230
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,160
going in like you know with the

1231
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,200
help desk it's like they get i mean

1232
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,480
yes i i can name at least uh

1233
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,960
five people uh that are way better than

1234
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,520
i am

1235
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,280
uh i can name at least 20 people that

1236
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,520
are better than i am but the top five

1237
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,240
are all women

1238
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,599
and we're also talking about the um

1239
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,200
educate and obviously if something is

1240
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,280
wrong you need to educate the employees

1241
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,319
definitely and then obviously

1242
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,839
that's from my own experience but i've

1243
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,359
worked in about

1244
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,440
about seven different companies in my

1245
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,119
career so far

1246
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,359
everybody wants to do it or because they

1247
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,040
have to do it it's some sort of you know

1248
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,440
audit thing you have to have your

1249
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,560
security training program in place and

1250
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,119
as most of us know this does entail

1251
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,359
those lengthy policies

1252
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,480
you know death by by powerpoint and all

1253
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,119
that reach

1254
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,040
100 pages of the information security

1255
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,280
policy have you done that

1256
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
yeah but nobody wants to spend the money

1257
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,200
for the stuff that really works and

1258
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,960
there's one place i've worked in the

1259
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,040
past i won't say who

1260
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,480
and it was actually the only place where

1261
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,920
i found the training program

1262
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,520
interesting now i'm a security

1263
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,200
professional i do find security stuff

1264
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,880
interesting but even i can't say through

1265
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,599
all those

1266
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,480
you know 10 page policies but at that

1267
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,359
one place

1268
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,960
um they actually spend the money and

1269
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,240
um use third-party software for it

1270
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,000
obviously i i can't say who they are

1271
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,319
because it might be seen as advertising

1272
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,800
but it was basically really snappy and

1273
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,440
funny

1274
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,560
funny like two to three minute videos it

1275
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,400
was so funny that you actually enjoyed

1276
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,400
every time i got a notification that

1277
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,920
you know a new video has been added to

1278
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,680
your security channels like stop stop

1279
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,359
whatever it is i'm doing i'm going in

1280
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:47,839
there

1281
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,839
and i'm gonna watch the video and it's

1282
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,280
the stuff you remember

1283
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,880
obviously i never learned anything new

1284
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,440
because thank god you know i really had

1285
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,440
that knowledge already but for somebody

1286
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,680
who isn't this was such a great way to

1287
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,079
actually

1288
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,079
get them engaged and you're talking

1289
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,920
about the gamification as well each

1290
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,280
video you watched

1291
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,960
you're on different points and badges

1292
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,400
and all that so there was competition

1293
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,359
going on

1294
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,359
you know who is going to get the half

1295
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,280
day off because you know they're

1296
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,960
ranked up that stuff actually works

1297
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,400
well that's good yeah exactly i'm

1298
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,160
actually working on a security awareness

1299
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,720
thing for

1300
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,119
companies right now and it's all funny

1301
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,000
it's like you know

1302
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,839
because my whole thing is it's like i

1303
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,599
try to be funny through the talk i mean

1304
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,119
they'll be debating about if that

1305
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,240
actually worked or not

1306
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,079
but i like to be humorous through the

1307
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,680
mild talk because if you're laughing

1308
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,920
you're paying attention and you're awake

1309
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,640
it's like so i try to keep it engaging

1310
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,319
because i want them to understand what

1311
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,040
i'm saying

1312
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,200
not just like we're just waiting for

1313
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,400
what's the next weird

1314
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,880
or wacky thing he's gonna say it's like

1315
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,200
and they're still listening to it

1316
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,000
and i have we have one minute i have two

1317
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,359
questions i'm not sure we can get

1318
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,400
through them so i'll fire them off

1319
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:54,960
quickly

1320
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,119
have you found that firing people for

1321
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,560
clicking on phishing links

1322
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,359
has encouraged compliance and increased

1323
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,400
company security of any company

1324
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,440
um i don't have any hard data on that

1325
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,480
it's like i'm not uh trust me if i don't

1326
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,839
know an answer it's like i'm not one of

1327
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,280
those people gonna be acting like i do

1328
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,960
it's like i'll tell you straight outside

1329
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,560
i don't know the answer to that

1330
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,599
i am telling you this though we fire

1331
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,359
