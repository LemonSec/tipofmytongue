1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,399
so

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,480
um my talk title is based on the lyrics

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,599
of a song by

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,920
lisa hannigan she's a local irish

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,960
musician

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,519
and it's a song about not taking time to

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,400
appreciate the here and

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,960
now as we all race ahead towards our

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,640
goals and advancing our lives

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,000
and my girlfriend introduced me to her

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,160
music and it just just melts my heart so

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
just thought the kind of uh lyric was

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,840
quite cool

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,320
um so i'm i'm a

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,079
dublin local i've lived here my whole

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,840
life uh northsider

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
and there we go

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,879
uh so yeah enjoy a single point to get

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,559
guinness on a friday night uh

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,960
like a responsible adult should uh or at

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,399
least i used to

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,960
and i also enjoy gaelic football and

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,840
dublin winning sam maguire every year

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,120
we're a real pack of winners here in

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
dublin so uh you know luckily

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
all you cultures are muted right now so

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,879
you know i can't hear you telling me to

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,239
shut up

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,280
and i recently started a company

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,119
named slandall research limited after

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,600
working as a sole trader for a few years

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,640
and a true subcontract and i've seen how

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,280
lots of

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,439
different consultancies do their thing

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,200
i've also had to review a lot of

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,479
different reports by a lot of different

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,920
companies over the years

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,280
and i genuinely believe i can deliver

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
something unique

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
and kind of do try to sculpt my tests in

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,600
a collaborative way

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
kind of getting access to source code

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
and

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,799
digging deep and spending more time than

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,280
probably

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
would be normal so my prices are cheaper

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,560
so

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,000
over the years i've been exposed to a

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,399
lot of different roles i've advised in

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,680
vulnerability management

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
i've worked incident response with apts

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,040
on the network i

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
regularly do internal and external

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
penetration tests

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
and i've luckily been exposed to a lot

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,240
of different industries

57
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
and kind of seen how a lot of different

58
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
businesses of all sizes

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
operate and to me consulting is really

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,159
rewarding

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
as you're just constantly learning and

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
there's always new things to be on top

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,320
of

64
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,239
so i kind of hope with setting up a

65
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,000
company to kind of eventually give other

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
people the same opportunities i've had

67
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,640
and

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,599
uh hopefully create a few jobs so i had

69
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:15,920
a

70
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,000
pretty good run in the book benny space

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
with my skills improving year on year

72
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,080
this just kind of little graph is just

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
from bug crowd and

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,080
kind of see that criticalities were

75
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,800
higher

76
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,720
as time progressed and i kind of just

77
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,599
packed it in a bit in 2019 because the

78
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,319
workload

79
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,680
working with my clients it's got to be

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,840
too much so i kind of

81
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
enjoy my free time um

82
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,480
and yeah i find the book benny community

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,720
is a real phenomenal place to learn

84
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
it's unlike anything i've experienced

85
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
and i do hope to dip back into it at

86
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,519
some point

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,120
my favorite work at the moment is

88
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
working with startups

89
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
and i kind of like that you can see over

90
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,319
time you know a startup starts small

91
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,680
with a small team

92
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,159
and you know if you get them kind of

93
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,480
aware of security from the beginning

94
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
over time that kind of cascades as the

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,519
organization grows

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,080
um so the security game uh this is going

97
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
to be me reading a kind of

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,959
spiel so we find ourselves in a

99
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
precarious game the digital landscape

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,879
and environment changes daily

101
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,400
expectations and rules don't always

102
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
apply

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,640
and when you play the security game for

104
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,239
long enough you lose the ability to be

105
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,440
surprised

106
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,319
so security is a state of being free

107
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,440
from danger threat

108
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
which on the internet or greater society

109
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
in general is never assured

110
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
so online we live on the front lines of

111
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,360
where worlds and modern culture collide

112
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,400
relentlessly and all at once crime and

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
all the negative caveats of society

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,799
manifest in bulk here

115
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,239
it's more anonymous and secure for

116
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,239
criminal groups to operate online

117
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
it's not only are they distance from

118
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
their victims they

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,120
they benefit from the same automations

120
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
and convenience e-commerce does

121
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
so even criminals have to minimize their

122
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,720
own operational risks

123
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
and all of you in security are the

124
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
defenders and attackers builders and

125
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,680
breakers

126
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
and the advances in the neighbor

127
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,000
enablers of business in this space

128
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
so the creators of progress in general

129
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
and potentially we're the arbitrators of

130
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,238
a future that harmoniously merges

131
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,079
technology with society

132
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
so on behalf of the planet we're hacking

133
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
right now i want to say thank you for

134
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,919
all the work you do

135
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,960
it's not too much for a saturday morning

136
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,759
maybe

137
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
so the problems i see everywhere are the

138
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,759
following

139
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,400
web services are a fun and large attack

140
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
surface and by nature they're publicly

141
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,759
exposed

142
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,680
so vulnerability management and

143
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,240
maintaining networks is a difficult task

144
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
stuff always and eventually gets lost in

145
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
space and falls through the cracks

146
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,479
there's a need to move towards a kind of

147
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,160
continuous validation of security

148
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,960
controls

149
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,479
and asset management and perimeter

150
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,000
monitoring are

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
just a growing area and they're they're

152
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
so essential

153
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,320
so to participate in this cyber space

154
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,639
you need the right tools and resources

155
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,080
you need visibility of your network you

156
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
need visibility of the playing field

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,199
in this day and age there's a lot of

158
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
free or paid network info tools you can

159
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
use out there

160
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,000
um you need to spend the time evaluating

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
your attack surface and what's out there

162
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,919
and we've always reached a point reached

163
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,520
the point of needing reconnaissance

164
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,400
tools

165
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,960
to find the latest and greatest tools to

166
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
achieve this task

167
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
so one of these tools is project sonar

168
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,919
it's my favorite

169
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,120
uh resource it um

170
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,479
it has historical dns data and

171
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
network scans and goes back to i think

172
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,520
2012 or 2013.

173
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
so i use russ scripts to parse out this

174
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
data into formats i need

175
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
and it makes searching it quite easy and

176
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
there's a few other tools

177
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,160
there listed that can do the same thing

178
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
but having historical data to me is

179
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,639
incredibly useful and it gives you a

180
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,880
really kind of unique insight into

181
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
uh where a company has has how a company

182
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
has developed so

183
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,440
you know where their assets used to be

184
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
what domains they used to use

185
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,880
and you know you can find a lot of

186
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,479
hidden things if you're looking through

187
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,560
that historical data

188
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,520
so um with network discovery a lot of

189
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
time is spent kind of enriching the data

190
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,240
you already have and

191
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
over the years i've created a lot of

192
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
kind of tools to to leverage

193
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,120
other tools so just kind of hacking

194
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,479
stuff together

195
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,919
um there's a lot of benefits i feel to

196
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,840
get familiar with the network discovery

197
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,639
process

198
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,000
and by building your own unique

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
workflows uh

200
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
and you know uniting sources in kind of

201
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,199
unique ways you can identify new

202
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,919
unexplored

203
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,319
attack services so hacking to me has

204
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,000
always meant like leveraging the tools

205
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,759
or resources at your disposal

206
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,479
to kind of achieve a greater objective

207
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,120
so

208
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
you know you can use data in unexpected

209
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
ways or build on top of the tools or

210
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,039
things that have come before

211
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,800
and it's just essentially thrown a

212
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,319
solution together to get the job done

213
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,319
for the task at hand

214
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,800
so in discovery anything you do

215
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,120
different could be an advantage and lead

216
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,599
lead to you finding kind of easy wins

217
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,639
and

218
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,199
unexpected results so you know you've

219
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,240
gathered all the data

220
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
ips domains and ports for your target

221
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
you've mapped out the attack surface

222
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,039
what what do you do next so

223
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,120
the way i approached this was i kind of

224
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,479
created my own tool

225
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,280
and it it was developed over a number of

226
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,400
years

227
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,639
and just to help me achieve my

228
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,840
objectives

229
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,599
so it's developed in python and it you

230
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
know runs on most platforms

231
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,440
i've i've kind of enjoyed the process of

232
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,759
optimizing and

233
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,000
it's pretty fast for a point and till in

234
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,960
in this space

235
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,479
and there's a lot of other good tools

236
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,560
out there written in go and

237
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
i suppose naturally faster languages

238
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,479
and but i like this because i've been

239
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,919
maintaining over time and i've

240
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,000
managed to keep the features i want in a

241
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
single tool

242
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,800
so you know there's a million different

243
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
scripts out there and web testing tools

244
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
and but i tried to build something kind

245
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
of flexible generic and

246
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
quite automated so it allows me to

247
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,120
create

248
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,400
modules that kind of

249
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,919
i can run a lot of different kinds of

250
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,759
web attacks and

251
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,160
i i use it for ad hoc tasks too so in

252
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
defense you know

253
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,000
a new vulnerability comes out i can

254
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
create a proof of concept and scan

255
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
the whole network you know in a matter

256
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,639
of minutes and

257
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,520
over over time you you build up modules

258
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,958
and it's kind of

259
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,320
nice to have them all in one place

260
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
instead of grabbing you know 10

261
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,679
different github projects

262
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,519
to do 10 different things i can do them

263
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
all with one too

264
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,958
so i kind of feel like the next step for

265
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,040
this tool is to open source it

266
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
and i'm releasing it today under an agpl

267
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,959
license

268
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,959
and i suppose the big question people

269
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,399
might have is like does it actually work

270
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,240
or do anything different than what's out

271
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,480
there already

272
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,959
so last august i turned my sights on

273
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,000
5i infrastructure sorry i meant

274
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
i meant fireeye there's only one letter

275
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
in the difference so it's an easy

276
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
mistake to make i

277
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,320
i turned their skin only on their

278
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,000
all the info i found all the network

279
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,519
info i'd gathered

280
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,640
uh fire eyes kind of public face and

281
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,360
network resources

282
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
so as anomaly kind of can store the full

283
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,600
response data and it's in an sqlite

284
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,160
database

285
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,399
it's it's very easy to search for things

286
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,560
and i essentially ran this across all

287
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,680
the open ports

288
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
all the domains i found all the ips i

289
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
found historical and

290
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,800
current and one example here is i found

291
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
the splunk application exposed to the

292
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
internet

293
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
so i suppose for anyone familiar with

294
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,519
splunk they know it runs as route and

295
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,959
it's possible to install your own app

296
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,200
plugins

297
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,000
so i popular root web shell as you do

298
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,720
and i

299
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,040
submitted my report to book crowd and

300
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,800
even though the host impacted was only a

301
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
lab

302
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
it's you know probably insignificant in

303
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
the grand scheme of things for far eye

304
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
but

305
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,079
it's still a foothold that could have

306
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
been leveraged within that effective net

307
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,959
affected network so you know with root

308
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,560
you could have recovered user password

309
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
hashes or

310
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
done anything you want to the operating

311
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
system and

312
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
the plugins already installed on this

313
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,600
tool also had like

314
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
multiple api keys for different things

315
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,079
like forest total and

316
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,680
it's a bad exposure but they rewarded

317
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,240
meter maximum bounty anyway

318
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,320
which isn't bad for an evening's work

319
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,600
and considering i only ran

320
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,880
one scan with anomaly so

321
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,560
it should be clear that you know even

322
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
the giants in the security world can let

323
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,839
stuff fall through the cracks

324
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,360
this this wasn't meant to be public

325
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
facing but it could have been exposed

326
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,040
accidentally or temporarily

327
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
oops um so a few weeks later i i ran

328
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,519
some more

329
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
content discovery scans uh using the

330
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,800
same tool

331
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
and kind of looked for common

332
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,560
directories on all the web applications

333
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
i identified

334
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,920
so in this case i found the kind of

335
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
interesting one

336
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
where it was just the root direct the

337
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,160
root domain and

338
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,360
forward slash welcome so

339
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
i started probing this endpoint and

340
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,040
basically

341
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,000
identified a kind of weird uh insecure

342
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,480
direct

343
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
direct object reference attack so i

344
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,920
don't know if people are familiar with

345
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
this but

346
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,279
it's uh where a developer uses a kind of

347
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,160
guessable or innumerable or brute

348
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
forceable value to reference a data

349
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
object

350
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,480
so this data could be loaded from the

351
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
database for example

352
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
but the data is returned without

353
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,920
validating if the current user has

354
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,480
actual permissions to view it so

355
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,040
i was able to discover email accounts of

356
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,959
fireeye customers

357
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
that hadn't completed a sign up process

358
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
so as you can see kind of on the

359
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
picture on the left i don't know if

360
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
laser pointer works it does there we go

361
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
so you can kind of see like this is a

362
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
form to create an account

363
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
and you know once i created the account

364
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
i was able to bypass their octa which is

365
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,160
their single

366
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,560
sign-on and it granted me access to

367
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,079
their customer portal

368
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
so if i was you know a filthy hacker

369
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
from here i could have downloaded

370
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
firearms products and firmware patches

371
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
and you know i could have reverse

372
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,079
engineered them and potentially found

373
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,680
some zero days in them

374
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,959
but instead i did the right thing and

375
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,480
reported the issue and they were more

376
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,760
rewarded me two thousand

377
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
dollars for this finding maybe maybe i

378
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,959
upset them and they didn't give me the

379
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,440
fuller

380
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,200
full amount so uh i guess

381
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,880
there's a lot of different modules i've

382
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,720
built over over the past while to do a

383
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,399
lot of different things

384
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,680
there's a lot of other tools out there

385
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,519
to do these things but i guess my kind

386
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,240
of generic

387
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,279
solution allows me to take any kind of

388
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,000
web

389
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
web-based tool and incorporate it into

390
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,839
this kind of framework

391
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,920
so i can do directory brew forcing i can

392
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
do

393
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,639
generic fuzzing of parameters i can

394
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,680
do v host brew forcing etc etc and and

395
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,800
basically

396
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
because of the way i've built this it's

397
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
it's configurable

398
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,519
and essentially you can configure

399
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
what you want to run on specific results

400
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,639
so

401
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,800
if you get a like 403 directory you

402
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,240
could run a module that

403
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,440
tries to bypass 403 or

404
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
issues to kind of expose additional

405
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
things or you know you find a directory

406
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
it'll recursively go through the

407
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
directories and

408
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
brute force for new things and if it

409
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,560
identifies a kind of

410
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,959
http auth endpoint it'll automatically

411
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,160
run a kind of default

412
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,680
user and password brute force stack

413
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,399
so i was going to prepare videos to kind

414
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,760
of uh

415
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,760
avoid messing up in a live presentation

416
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
but uh i do have kind of i do have had a

417
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
few kind of examples in mind

418
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
i was going to write an example

419
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,360
uh and show how easy it is to kind of

420
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,760
manipulate web requests and and

421
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
then scan for them across a wide attack

422
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,760
surface

423
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
but i'm going to i'm going to do it live

424
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,120
instead i'm just hopefully

425
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,839
everything breaks

426
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,079
so i'm trying to exit out of my

427
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,839
there we go

428
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,560
sorry folks

429
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,680
and hopefully you can see my screen now

430
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
so i kind of just prepared a little demo

431
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,079
to show the tool running

432
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,160
and what you can see here

433
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,199
in the center is a kind of

434
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,760
the config how it works so i can choose

435
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
which statuses to ignore

436
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,079
i can choose which modules to run on

437
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,880
which statuses

438
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,079
so

439
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,639
i'm just i kind of created this

440
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,480
directory to kind of just give a quick

441
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
idea of how the tail works

442
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
so i'm going to just run a direct rebrew

443
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,839
force and

444
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,319
i think that's everything i need

445
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,440
i'll leave i'll leave that run in the

446
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,199
meantime it's kind of running in the

447
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
background and when you see the results

448
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,279
it kind of will make more sense i can

449
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,839
okay that didn't work two seconds

450
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,279
i knew i forgot a flag there we go

451
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,920
so i've had a pass tool before called

452
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,279
paramet where

453
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,480
i brute force to try identify get and

454
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,120
post

455
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
parameters on an endpoint and

456
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,360
essentially

457
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,839
just i just want to kind of show how

458
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,880
much quicker

459
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,839
this skin anomaly tool makes proof of

460
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,000
concept and kind of fuzzing ideas

461
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,120
so i take the same tool i had written

462
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
before it's just a script

463
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,720
it's like a few hundred lines of uh of

464
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
python

465
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
so now you can see it there but

466
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,120
basically i just what kind of want to

467
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,560
show how generic

468
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
uh skenomy is and how easy it is to kind

469
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
of write plugins and modules for this

470
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,880
so hey kieran paul here is it is there

471
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
any chance you can increase your font on

472
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
your terminal let the

473
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,199
the folks see a little bit better just

474
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
getting some comments

475
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,880
yeah yeah sure a little bit easier

476
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,040
easier if you can change it

477
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,720
sorry for interrupting thanks oh you're

478
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
grounded

479
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,720
it's not a

480
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,120
i forget where it is i'm not too

481
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,399
familiar with windows terminals

482
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,000
i need anyone to want to assist hey

483
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,440
don't worry about it it's only if it's

484
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,120
an easy ass don't don't worry yeah no i

485
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,480
i just i don't know how to increase the

486
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:52,959
font

487
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,000
it's probably easy enough to do

488
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,839
so i just i'll show you the module for

489
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,120
parameter

490
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,799
so in the in this kind of module

491
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,919
it does a lot more than my old parameter

492
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,880
script did

493
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
and it's only you know this amount of

494
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,119
code

495
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,439
so what i what i can do now is i can

496
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,240
brute force

497
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
to try identify cookies the

498
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,439
application's using

499
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
i can try identify different headers

500
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,679
that the application is using

501
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,839
and essentially just fuzz and use kind

502
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,039
of common

503
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,320
strings or data to identify get and post

504
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,520
parameters

505
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,559
so the tool takes in

506
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,720
a list of requests you can pass in a

507
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,039
file containing a list of urls

508
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,679
you can pass with it with a minus or

509
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,880
like i don't know if people are familiar

510
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,360
with

511
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,280
sql map but you can pass in an entire

512
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,559
request so you could just copy out of

513
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,520
burp suite

514
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,880
and essentially run run

515
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
this tool and detect the anomalies that

516
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,039
happen

517
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,400
when when the request is made so

518
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,640
i don't know if you see there uh on the

519
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,600
left-hand side but

520
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,440
there's one response from the directory

521
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,520
brute force that's expected

522
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,120
but that that that's running through

523
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,360
there and you know it's making 136

524
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,720
000 requests in a matter of minutes

525
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,559
and it's the kind of thing where because

526
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,400
the data stored you can just leave this

527
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,640
run overnight and come back to it and

528
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,000
assess what the results are in the

529
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,320
morning

530
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
um

531
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
i kind of expected to have a bit longer

532
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
here

533
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,720
or to not go through the talk as quick

534
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,840
so i just have a kind of example module

535
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,120
to kind of show you what kind of

536
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,000
different things you can do

537
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,559
so yeah the module takes in a list of

538
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
requests you can you can manipulate

539
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,799
these requests in any way you want and

540
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,200
i have a lot of different kind of

541
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
functions to do this

542
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
so you can update the module name you

543
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,080
can update the proxy it uses you know

544
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,480
you could

545
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,919
you could fire each different request

546
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,320
through a different proxy if you wanted

547
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,240
you can import files and

548
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
one of the parameters it passes in as

549
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,000
rules so you could pass in

550
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
a different config file that you want to

551
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,200
use that kind of

552
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,799
does a multi-us multi-staged attack

553
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,919
so i don't know if you can see there

554
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,120
it's just brute force in the directory

555
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
and the kind of cool thing is is you

556
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
know finds a new directory it'll

557
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,600
recursively do that

558
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,480
but also if it if it finds different

559
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,880
things

560
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
it'll it'll run you can you can kind of

561
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
configure it to run

562
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,440
what modules you want on on whatever

563
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
results

564
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,840
so i do i do also have a project roadmap

565
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,640
for this

566
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
i have a few kind of ways i want to take

567
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
the tool and

568
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,320
i suppose develop it further but i'm

569
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,679
kind of interested to see how a

570
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,520
community input

571
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
could help so the reason i initially

572
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,080
built it was

573
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,039
mostly for speed so i got kind of maybe

574
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
go back two or three years burp suite

575
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,000
was very slow

576
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
and at the time there was a plug-in

577
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,360
called

578
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,439
um i think it was like

579
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
turbo intruder or something like that

580
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,520
but you're essentially writing

581
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,080
python scripts directly into burp as a

582
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,880
plugin

583
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
or you know to do custom attacks and i

584
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,240
was kind of like

585
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,320
why why you use burp for that when you

586
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,000
can just write your own tool to do it

587
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
i mean if you're going to be writing

588
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
code directly into a tool

589
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,080
i guess it's it loses its kind of

590
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,640
reusability and

591
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
it seems kind of annoying to me

592
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,760
so i like i like the idea of having

593
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
custom tools that you can

594
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,320
configure yourself

595
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,240
so yeah and also just because because

596
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
the data stored in sql-like database

597
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,600
you can do anything with it you can do a

598
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,280
lot of additional

599
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
stuff on top you can you know import

600
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,120
this into other tools you can

601
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,840
use the data in in interesting ways

602
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,360
i'm happy to take questions now anyway

603
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,479
if anyone has any

604
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,400
yeah so i think we have um two questions

605
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,799
so

606
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,080
the first one there is and

607
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,919
does skin normally have helper man pages

608
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,640
so this is definitely something i wanted

609
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,520
to have done before i released this but

610
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
not not right now so i was going to do a

611
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,120
wiki on it and i suppose as people add

612
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,240
modules we could

613
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,440
document how do you how it works

614
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,159
you can probably see that it's it's a

615
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,080
bit of a mess at the minute

616
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
and it takes a lot of different

617
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,120
parameters the idea is

618
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,158
for it to be flexible

619
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,960
and you can pass in you know headers you

620
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,039
can pass in

621
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,320
anything i feel that i would need

622
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,720
to configure so just just here it's run

623
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,679
through the first

624
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,039
the first two modules i specified

625
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,120
so i specified a dirt brew forest and

626
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,159
kind of a

627
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,679
repo attack which would be like common

628
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,480
of common files and configuration files

629
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,400
and you can see that i found one 200

630
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,640
response and one one 301 response which

631
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,760
is another directory

632
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,039
so it's just recursively going through

633
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,200
that and from the kind of

634
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,520
yaml configuration it knows what to run

635
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,760
on what different responses

636
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
and you can kind of play around with

637
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,880
this and do a lot of interesting things

638
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,240
um i guess like for me you know being

639
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,799
able to write just four lines of code to

640
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,799
create a custom kind of template for an

641
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,720
attack is is really useful

642
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
it's really it speeds up a lot of things

643
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
i do

644
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,919
just kind of show there it's just

645
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,360
running through the same thing again on

646
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,159
on the

647
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,280
next directory it found

648
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,280
i think it ends after this one but it'll

649
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
it'll print out the results in a kind of

650
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
interesting way

651
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,159
once it's done but another thing i kind

652
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:38,640
of

653
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,480
used this tool for was say you know

654
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
you're doing kind of white box testing

655
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,159
where you have access to the server

656
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,679
so the other thing you can kind of do is

657
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,919
pull a list of all the

658
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,400
the files in a web directory and then

659
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
you can run this school

660
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,480
this tool over it very easily i have

661
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
flags to do diffs between different

662
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,360
databases so

663
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,520
if you run if you run like a scan you

664
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,559
know once a day

665
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,840
and something changes there might be

666
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,279
something interesting happening there

667
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,480
that you can go and investigate

668
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,760
afterwards

669
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,320
um and that's kind of interesting when

670
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,840
you start running it across a whole

671
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
entire network of assets

672
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
because you know a new website might

673
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,520
appear that's a new attack surface that

674
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
you haven't looked at yet

675
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,120
so we have a couple more questions there

676
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,799
if you want to take them

677
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,159
cool and one of them there is so when

678
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,840
will it be available to the public

679
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,480
and where i'm going to publicly release

680
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,760
it and now

681
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,279
once once the talk is finished i'm going

682
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
to just change it from private to public

683
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,400
but it should be up there

684
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,480
so it's it's it's been an old version of

685
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,679
it's been public for a while but i'm

686
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,960
after adding a lot of different new

687
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,919
things

688
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,840
so i guess document is my primary kind

689
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,200
of goal at the minute

690
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,039
and and kind of making it more

691
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,640
user-friendly

692
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,279
okay and then we have another question

693
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:03,840
there

694
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,679
so have you built any sort of all that

695
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,159
reporting that sits on top of or besides

696
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,760
screen only that runs against

697
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,880
the cpu light findings

698
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,520
so yeah i i do a lot of kind of um

699
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,960
additional things on top of this

700
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,440
so uh at the beginning before i kind of

701
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,600
built in the the anomaly detection into

702
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,240
it

703
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,480
i had a kind of web app dashboard that i

704
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,080
could kind of

705
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,760
it would alert me on changes so

706
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,480
if i was like fuzzing the same web app

707
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
multiple times

708
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,679
you know a different result could

709
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,520
indicate a kind of new development or a

710
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,320
new

711
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,520
um feature of that application so

712
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,120
uh you know you could you could export

713
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,720
your entire burp

714
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
uh crawl into and and just basically use

715
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,559
the urls i'm

716
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,320
running through this tool so kind of

717
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,919
i've found some really interesting like

718
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,120
authorization

719
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
or authentication bypass attacks using

720
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,240
that so

721
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,480
you log in with burp and you just test

722
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,840
as you normally would

723
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
and then just export all the urls and

724
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,520
run it with this unauthenticated

725
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,720
and see what endpoints you can hit while

726
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,640
unauthenticated and that can sometimes

727
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
lead to some interest in

728
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,960
information leaks and data leaks from

729
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,440
software

730
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,200
okay i think we got we have two minutes

731
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,360
there and i get another question in

732
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,640
um can the two be used for disputed

733
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,240
scanning content discovery at scale

734
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,440
it can so you might see here it takes

735
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,279
each url and stores it into its own

736
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,360
database

737
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,880
so i suppose like a kind of a a

738
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,720
roadmap for the tool would be kind of

739
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
unifying all them into one

740
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,039
kind of nice app that you can just view

741
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,840
easily kind of browse through all the

742
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,200
data

743
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,960
but i think this this should finish now

744
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,320
shortly but

745
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
i guess i just kind of want to show

746
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,880
how much request it's making so

747
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,240
it's already gone through a quarter of a

748
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,000
million requests in

749
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,279
the last like five minutes or so

750
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,760
but um

751
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,240
it's it has some downsides so i i store

752
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
the sqlite databases while it's running

753
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
in in memory

754
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
and you know understandably if the tool

755
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,159
crashes it'll it'll wipe that scan that

756
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,279
was running

757
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,480
but on the other side i guess it's it's

758
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,679
a lot quicker

759
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,760
so once the scan finishes i just dump

760
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,799
the memory out into

761
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,840
a file

762
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
but you can do a lot of different

763
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
interesting things

764
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,360
i'm kind of hoping

765
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,760
it'll develop with open source and

766
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,039
people can kind of build more

767
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,200
interesting modules

768
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
but it's very easy to take kind of

769
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,039
python proof of concept someone

770
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,679
wrote online and just incorporated into

771
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,520
the tool and it now has all the features

772
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,320
that

773
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,080
i suppose you don't have to rewrite it's

774
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:17,840
like saving you a lot of time

775
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,120
it ran quicker when i tested it

776
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,240
but yeah there's some kind of cool flags

777
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,600
as well you can have it

778
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,480
only store unique responses you can have

779
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,039
it uh

780
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,120
so it's quite nice for fuzzing um

781
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,559
and because you can pass your own list

782
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,440
into it it's very kind of flexible

783
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,039
so this should finish now and kind of

784
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,720
dump out the results from all the scans

785
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,399
it did

786
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,159
so this is the kind of format and you

787
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,440
can kind of see it's

788
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,919
what what kind of method request method

789
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,279
was used

790
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,080
the url and how many you know headers

791
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,360
were in the response

792
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,960
the number of string tokens in the

793
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
response and

794
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
how long the request took the size of

795
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
the response that kind of thing

796
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
but then

797
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,399
this data is obviously in the in the

798
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,240
database so it can be reused and

799
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,360
used elsewhere so we're kind of up on

800
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,520
time there now and a very tight schedule

801
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,279
unfortunately oh yeah perfect

802
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,440
so um thank you very much kieran for

803
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,559
that talk um

804
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,000
and i think the link was shared in the

805
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,360
chat there if anybody wants to have a

806
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,480
look at that tool

807
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
once it's released and i think it is

808
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,880
either now or will be very very soon but

809
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
thank you very much for your time karen

810
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:41,840
appreciate it thanks folks
