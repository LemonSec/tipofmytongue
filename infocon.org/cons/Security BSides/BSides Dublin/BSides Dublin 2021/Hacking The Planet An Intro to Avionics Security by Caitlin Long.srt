1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,560
hi

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,519
i'm caitlin this is my talk hacking the

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,240
planet

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,799
intro to avionics security uh my twitter

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,280
handle

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,919
is a zero x 2060 it's in the corner

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,800
hi a little bit about me uh i'm caitlin

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
i've been working in investing for

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,960
nearly two years now and my one of my

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,080
main hobbies is

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
aerospace and computer security i've

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,079
been fascinated

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,239
by aerospace or anything in my space

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,160
ever since like interstellar came out in

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
2014.

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,399
one of my plans after the pandemic ends

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,520
is to finally take

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
flying lessons i want to get like my

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
sports pilot license

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,719
uh this talk will be about the security

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
and cryptography of the onboard computer

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,399
systems on aircraft

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,480
uh what side channel attacks are in some

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
hardware security

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,279
this talks about

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,760
a really specific job field in the

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
aerospace industry uh

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,600
lots of large aerospace companies in the

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,479
us

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,720
that do defense contracting have

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,760
engineers that

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,720
are dedicated to this type of hardware

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,280
security

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,479
some vocabulary avionics by definition

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
are the electronic systems on

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280
aircraft and satellites anything that

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,920
goes way up in space

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
uh crypto systems are defined as a pair

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,798
of algorithms such as encryption and

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,240
decryption

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
um side channel attacks they are defined

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
as attacks that are based on the

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,960
implement

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,079
information gained from the

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
implementation of a computer system to

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,439
derive the secret key

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,520
this is intro to avionics uh this is

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,799
a diagram of all the different computer

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,520
systems

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,960
on on an aircraft

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
from power systems to fuel management

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,160
systems through navigation and guidance

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,360
and instrumentation

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
and data the dcu which is like i would

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,239
call it like the big brain of a aircraft

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,000
is uh it sensor data concentrated unit

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
it basically takes all that data that

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
you see below it

59
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,879
and it concentrates into one area

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,120
intro to cryptography this is one of my

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,160
favorite things

62
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,840
in the world um right next to like

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,040
satellites in space uh cryptography

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
it's you know it's a it's can be

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
described as a way of encoding and

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
decoding messages there are two types uh

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,920
symmetric and asymmetric also known as

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,959
public key

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,440
there are several types of graphic

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
attacks um

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
password cracking which i'm sure we're

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
all familiar with

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,599
uh collision attacks birth attacks uh

74
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,080
pictured is alan during if you're not

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
familiar with him

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,920
he's known for cracking the enigma

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,599
machines during world war ii and he's

78
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,519
basically like the father of computer

79
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,920
science

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840
uh i included some diagrams of

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
asymmetric and symmetric key encryption

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,519
for those that might need a better time

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,640
visualizing it

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
side channel attacks these uh side

85
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,319
channel attacks are hardware crypto

86
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
analytic attacks that exploit

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,480
the physical behavior of a system such

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,360
as timing

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
power consumption and electromagnetic

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,159
magnetic emissions

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
other types of psi channel attacks

92
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
include power analysis talks

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
this is basically what a side channel

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,439
attack is

95
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,599
uh it's not a very good diagram but i

96
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,560
thought it

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,000
gets the information across

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,080
attacks side channel attacks are

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
performed with an

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,560
oscilloscope and a computer the

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
oscilloscope is to capture any traces

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,199
that

103
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,000
a computer might emit a computer or any

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
sort of system

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,919
uh power analysis attacks these attacks

106
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,320
are done by examining the power syst the

107
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
power consumed by a device

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,800
running a cryptographic algorithm so

109
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,400
every time there are two types

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,479
of power well there's two main types of

111
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,080
power analysis attacks there's

112
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
simple apparent analysis and

113
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,720
differential power analysis

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
simple power analysis these kind of

115
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
attacks uh they recover a single

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,160
could a single key from one transaction

117
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,479
uh they require a strong signal close

118
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
proximity to a target device and

119
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,600
they're usually based are usually

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,639
applied to

121
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,320
pub like key cryptography systems um

122
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,199
these kind of attacks uh they can reveal

123
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,080
a sequence

124
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,840
of instructions executed by a machine

125
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,120
and uh this kind of attacks uh

126
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
these whole power analysis it's very

127
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,720
math heavy

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,840
um lots of big brain

129
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,120
concepts uh there

130
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
it's usually upsets that of electrical

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,639
engineering if you've

132
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,759
ever studied engineering in college

133
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,759
uh this graph here it's a

134
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,360
it's a model of a single simple power

135
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,400
analysis attack

136
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,759
it's exploiting a power trace and

137
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,960
in the rsa algorithm

138
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,680
next type of power analysis attack that

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
i'll be going over is a differential

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,120
power

141
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,319
analysis a dpa they're a form of side

142
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,160
channel attacks that monitor variations

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
in the electrical

144
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,199
power consumption or the electromagnetic

145
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
emissions of a target device these

146
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
attacks uh they measure different

147
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,120
parts of the chip to recover the key

148
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
these attacks are a lot more powerful

149
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,319
than some

150
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,639
single power analysis and then uh

151
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,880
they're also a lot harder to prevent

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
um this is a simple representation of

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,960
the

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,080
dpa attack um like i said

155
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,280
this is a very math heavy concept um

156
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,638
i just think it's super cool

157
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
um but i won't be going over the this

158
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,080
all this

159
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,360
information in the slide but um it'll be

160
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,639
left in my slide deck if you want to

161
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,039
check it out for later

162
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,000
uh so back to avionics uh what is shown

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,639
here

164
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,160
is called an fpga field programming rule

165
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880
gate array

166
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,639
they're everywhere um

167
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,120
more in fpga uh these chips

168
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,199
they're integrated circuits they're used

169
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,319
in all

170
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,080
right away and

171
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,479
of systems um such as avionics

172
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,479
encryption

173
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,479
uh super computers probably cars i mean

174
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,319
your bridge probably has one as well i

175
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,680
wouldn't be surprised they're

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,840
everywhere they're in a lot of

177
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,479
applications

178
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
these integrated circuits uh they're

179
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,759
considered

180
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
secure due to the code customization it

181
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,639
allows for um my analogy

182
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,039
for bliss if you have a hard time like

183
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,440
understanding the concept

184
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,599
i would consider it think of it as

185
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,759
buying a plain frosted cake

186
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,520
at the grocery store and decorating it

187
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
yourself that's the best analogy

188
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,039
i can think of for it these chips are

189
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,360
most commonly used in aerospace and

190
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
they're used everywhere in avionics the

191
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
main reason for

192
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,919
fpgas being used as opposed to other

193
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,400
chips

194
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,680
is that adding hardware any additional

195
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,120
hardware on an aircraft is

196
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
really hard and

197
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
given that the fact they're the most

198
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,719
commonly used ones for that reason and

199
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,519
also they're

200
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
just a lot cheaper

201
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,760
so back to avionics uh if you recall

202
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
i used one of these graphs in my

203
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,439
previous slides

204
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
so think of all the applications that

205
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
fpga

206
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,399
chips have they're used in literally

207
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,760
every

208
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,399
part in

209
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,839
in the computer system on flights

210
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,600
how does this all relate to aerospace

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
big aerospace companies that do defense

212
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
contracting

213
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,200
in the us often have software engineers

214
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,560
that work on these

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,120
chips and on embedded cryptographic

216
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,839
function

217
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,000
functions and systems i thought it was a

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
really cool field that no one knows

219
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,120
about so i decided to do a talk about it

220
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,480
like i said a lot of these concepts

221
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,240
um they're pretty map heavy

222
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,880
a lot of physics um i could do like an

223
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,440
entire

224
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,680
talk on like probably differential power

225
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,440
and analysis alone

226
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
but i just wanted to do a broad overview

227
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,640
of this talk today

228
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,880
um to get to kind of like understand

229
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,160
uh what side channel attacks are and how

230
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
that relates to avionics

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,600
and yeah this is my talk uh my twitter

232
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,240
handle

233
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,320
up below is xerox 2060.

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,360
uh you can follow me but uh

235
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,839
yeah this is uh the end of my talk

236
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,279
so thanks very much for that and one

237
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,560
question if you don't mind so with the

238
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,600
future of avionics security being pretty

239
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
important

240
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
how do you feel the industry and the

241
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,000
attention

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
does the industry give it enough

243
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
attention compared to

244
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,240
other areas of security because yeah

245
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,760
if you took an aircraft out of the air

246
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
obviously there's going to be a lot more

247
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
collateral damage to life than it would

248
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,959
be if you knocked off some systems on

249
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,480
the ground so do you feel the industry

250
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,000
gives it enough attention

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
or do you think there's a lot more

252
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,279
attention should be given to and

253
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,399
maybe what way it's going uh for

254
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,880
aerospace as a whole i would say there's

255
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
not much

256
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
attention to this i think primarily the

257
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,800
bulk of

258
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
money and time that goes into this is

259
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,160
for the defense

260
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,440
uh contractors or companies that do

261
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
defense

262
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,959
okay thank you and we have another

263
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,040
question here actually um

264
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,959
do you come across much more analog

265
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,399
systems versus digital

266
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,920
in avionics oh you know that's a good

267
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,959
question that i

268
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,000
have not really considered

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,200
um i'd say like the there's a big shift

270
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,240
in moving towards

271
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,120
um electronic uh well digital systems

272
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
versus analog

273
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,839
for airplanes especially in defense

274
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,720
i'm sorry i can't really answer your

275
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
question but that was my

276
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
best answer that i could give you yeah

277
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,240
that's no problem at all and

278
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,079
so i i don't think there's any more

279
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,639
questions there so um

280
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
i think a few minutes are left so um if

281
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,880
there's no more questions then i think

282
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,240
we'll wrap it up then if that's all

283
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,040
right

284
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,200
okay all right thank you very much for

285
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:21,360
your time kevin appreciate it
