1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,880
a hundred thousand greetings from

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,559
uh the wet coast of north america

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
uh vancouver british columbia canada and

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,480
the vancouver

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,960
uh b-sides is is going to be held

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
in about a month and a half um

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
the uh

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
i am delighted to be back in back in

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,599
dublin because i

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,920
i taught a cissp review seminar there

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,360
um well about 17 years ago

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
interesting experience and

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,760
uh all of you can

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,200
take a picture of my screen and and

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,079
uh get all my details from that qr code

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,920
in complete safety

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,079
bearing in mind that i did get my start

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,079
in security

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,280
as a malware researcher and so i know

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
every way there is to trick people into

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,280
installing malware on their computers

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
however we'll not mention that

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
and yes we're going to be talking about

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
homomorphic encryption

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,400
here uh as soon as we get this thing to

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,520
work yes

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,400
uh this also is uh details which you can

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
clearly read

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,759
if you understand brought 13 since we're

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,400
talking about

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,240
encryption homomorphic encryption though

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
homomorphic encryption the basic idea is

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,799
you can encrypt the data and while it is

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
still encrypted without

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,720
decrypting it still be able to use it

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,840
for something um you can do something

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
with it you do not have to

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,520
uh

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,040
uh decrypt it in in order to uh

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,840
perform some kind of function to to be

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,200
able to

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
uh get any information um

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,520
oh wait oh yes canada somebody mentioned

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,680
canada on the on the chat i i should say

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
that this is the beginning of uh

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
canadian content time seeing us out

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,040
immediately after me there's chat and

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,959
then dave is going to be finishing up

49
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,160
with a keynote so

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,280
you're stuck with us for a while uh just

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
uh give me a second though and i'll fire

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,959
you guys um some details of

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,480
of uh links and stuff on the talk

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,080
anyway um so

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,400
on with homomorphic encryption while i

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
was setting up the slides

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,440
uh for this this presentation

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,640
uh i saw this this interesting news item

59
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,840
uh that uh

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,200
canada's uh cse that um which is

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
uh our version of the you know the spies

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,280
and and uh

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,560
communications uh and people

64
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
who spy on us and everybody else around

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
the world and so on and so forth

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
um they said that they were working

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
on the whole what they call the holy

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
grail of encryption

69
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
and this is of course homomorphic

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,560
encryption so you can encrypt something

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,120
it's

72
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,840
you can maintain the the encryption you

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
don't have to decrypt it you can still

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799
perform functions on it which is a bit

75
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,080
of an overstatement

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,200
as we will get to uh as we uh

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,879
proceed through this the first thing is

78
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,720
that homomorphic encryption

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
isn't new this is um

80
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,319
you know it's it's a lovely uh idea um

81
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,319
but of course uh you can

82
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,760
use it we have been using we've been

83
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
using it for decades

84
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,120
and of course all of you will be uh

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,879
completely familiar with the fact that i

86
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,480
am of course

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,680
talking about password hashing

88
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
when we uh store passwords we don't

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
store the password itself we store a

90
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,080
hash

91
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
and we store a one-way hash this is

92
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
intended that it's you're you're not

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
able to use the hash

94
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
uh to recover the password you you can't

95
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,639
decrypt the password uh on password

96
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,320
hashing and and you can

97
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,520
even uh logically

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
mathematically prove that because of

99
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,759
course we

100
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,639
hash to a fixed size when we store the

101
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,280
passwords and hashes

102
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,040
can compress any uh any size of message

103
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,240
into a fixed size hash digest so

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
therefore you you cannot know that you

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
are in fact recovering the password even

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
if you go through the dictionary attacks

107
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
and that sort of thing you may be able

108
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,479
to find a password that that works but

109
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
you can't find the original password

110
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,800
um so we've we have been using that

111
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,160
um we so you know this is something we

112
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,440
we keep the encrypted data and

113
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,360
we still get to use it uh so that's

114
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,720
that's what now another example

115
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
uh this is kind of a bad example of of

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,600
homomorphic encryption but

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
electronic code book for those of you

118
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,080
who have studied encryption you know

119
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
that electronic code book

120
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
mode of a block cipher is the weakest

121
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
form of any cipher

122
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,639
because if you encrypt

123
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
the same data you get the same

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,960
ciphertext so the same plain text

125
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
uh encrypted and electronic home code

126
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,080
book

127
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,639
is going to produce the same ciphertext

128
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,120
now

129
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,320
of course this leads to

130
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,719
um

131
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,880
situations where for example in in the

132
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
graphics if it's a fairly simple

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
graphic um and it's encrypted

134
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,160
in electronic code book mode

135
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
you can actually see what the

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
original graphic was or at least you

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,600
know

138
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,919
puzzle it out pretty pretty accurately

139
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,080
as as to what the original

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,120
image was uh

141
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
again if it's a simple image um

142
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,199
so we can use electronic

143
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
book in a block cipher

144
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,199
if we want to do an exact search and if

145
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,319
we are

146
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
uh searching for something where the the

147
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
block size is

148
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,479
is the same size as as the the data

149
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,400
we're looking for

150
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,880
so uh we can do a search we can do a

151
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
comparison we can do

152
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,880
an exact match um

153
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,759
if we're using that now that's not

154
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,599
something we normally do but it is the

155
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,160
functional we can perform

156
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
um we can do

157
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,560
sorting uh to a certain extent

158
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,319
for example a good old caesar cipher

159
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,440
you can use the sievered cipher or rot13

160
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
and do a sort and you will

161
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,800
basically get at least roughly a

162
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
a rough approximation of the sort that

163
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,400
you would get

164
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,240
otherwise um and that

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
i mean the caesar cipher is a mod

166
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,680
function a very simple mod function but

167
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
it is a mod function so

168
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,759
any ciphers that use mod functions

169
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,520
we should have the ability to do

170
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,720
a limited amount of of sorting

171
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,759
on that as i said these these are fairly

172
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,199
bad examples um

173
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
another one uh of course covet 19. you

174
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,639
know happy uh

175
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
covet uh pandemic anniversary by the way

176
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,560
which

177
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,520
was a couple of weeks ago but um

178
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,879
uh if we are doing contact tracing with

179
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,440
the

180
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,520
uh fairly widely used dp3t

181
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
protocol uh most of the

182
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,520
uh contact tracing apps that actually

183
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
have come into

184
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
implementation and i know that there's

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
a lot of question as to how useful these

186
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,839
things are but

187
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
they use pure random data

188
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,240
as a beacon um and

189
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
that does not contain any personally

190
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
identifiable information now

191
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,360
uh as soon as you get

192
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,959
into implementation of that

193
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,160
you start to see problems because

194
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,760
even if we record the beacon

195
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
along with the date and time or

196
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
the location we start to give away

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,920
personally identifiable information or

198
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
at least potentially

199
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
um but uh the

200
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,080
if the app the contact app is just

201
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,360
collecting the the beacon itself then

202
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
no we're not giving away uh any

203
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,519
personally identifiable information

204
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,399
we're not

205
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
uh invading privacy and that sort of

206
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
thing the

207
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,680
uh and that's just using random data so

208
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
i mean we can't

209
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,560
decrypt that for any purpose

210
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,120
uh so but again you know these aren't

211
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,959
particularly good examples

212
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,360
they are examples of the idea of

213
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
homomorphic encryption

214
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,080
but what we want is something a bit more

215
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,720
useful

216
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
and so let's get into

217
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,320
voting now of course voting um

218
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,399
uh lots of stuff i i worked as a

219
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
poll clerk and even deputy returning

220
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
officer and and some of the federal

221
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
elections here in canada

222
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,040
uh i i know that once you have

223
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,839
the ballot when you're when you're

224
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,720
counting the votes

225
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,399
basically all we have is confidentiality

226
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,000
and uh

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
the the process of the election

228
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,839
uh is where we get into identification

229
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,959
authentication authorization

230
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,040
uh non-repudiation

231
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
and you know and all those verifications

232
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
that we have to that's part of the

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,760
process but once we have the actual

234
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,480
ballot and

235
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,279
we're actually counting the votes we

236
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
only have the confidentiality and the

237
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,240
ability to

238
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,720
to count the votes so uh

239
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
if if you want to look this up i mean

240
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
you know people have have looked at this

241
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,360
for years

242
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
and we have voting machines we have

243
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,959
proposals for online voting

244
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,800
most of which are almost universally

245
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
terrible ideas and if you go to the

246
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,000
risks forum

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
digest and search on voting you will

248
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,120
find literally hundreds of articles

249
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,680
pointing out the the weaknesses and

250
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,000
flaws and vulnerabilities in

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,040
so many proposed voting systems but

252
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,800
revised and yes that is the reverse

253
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
that's the rnr

254
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,079
rsa uh came up with three

255
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,000
ballot voting and uh this is a

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,120
very very interesting system it

257
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,760
does give you the confidentiality and

258
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,200
anonymity

259
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,240
it gives you also non-repudiation of

260
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,519
voting

261
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,560
it allows the voter to verify

262
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,480
that their vote has been counted

263
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
the ballots are counted without ever

264
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,880
being decrypted so this

265
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,000
is an example of homomorphic encryption

266
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,720
it's a really

267
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,440
interesting one because when you go into

268
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
the details

269
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
you can implement this on

270
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
paper or digitally and so

271
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,480
finally in terms of voting machines

272
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,399
in terms of online voting

273
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,680
we do finally have

274
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,880
a system that uh

275
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,399
probably gives us uh at least

276
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,040
the beginnings of a good possibility of

277
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,560
of using it and it's

278
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,120
really really interesting example um

279
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
so this is is a much better example of

280
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
homomorphic encryption uh by the way

281
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,839
microsoft

282
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,079
recently uh

283
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,200
announced uh this uh system

284
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,519
product whatever called election guard

285
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,320
and

286
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
uh from the information that they have

287
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,440
given out on it it does seem to be based

288
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,560
on reverse three ballot voting system so

289
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,920
uh um something to

290
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,360
to watch out for there now

291
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,519
uh

292
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,320
that's that's one function but there are

293
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,079
other functions we want to do and

294
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,079
so um when you look at

295
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,079
homomorphic encryption and and what you

296
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,200
want to do

297
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,040
with the data without uh decrypting it

298
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,320
you have to build a function and and

299
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,279
algorithm based on what it is that you

300
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,040
want to do

301
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,920
for example addition and multiplication

302
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,880
fairly simple

303
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,800
uh arithmetic functions and of course

304
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
you know writ addition at least is is

305
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,000
going to be

306
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,079
uh fairly similar to the ballot counting

307
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,240
and that sort of thing

308
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,560
we uh addition and multiplication are

309
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,600
uh associative and commutative that's

310
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
uh what the the functions here

311
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,720
uh indicate so if we can find any

312
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,160
function that is

313
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,360
both associative and commutative it

314
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,839
might be the basis for a solution for an

315
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,199
algorithm

316
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,160
that will give us the ability to do

317
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
addition and multiplication

318
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,760
with undecrypted

319
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,519
data we can we can work on the encrypted

320
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,399
data

321
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,760
and get proper results

322
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,839
uh using this kind of a function and

323
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,680
this is how you find an algorithm

324
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,720
for any particular function for it for

325
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,560
anything that you want to do with

326
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,160
encrypted data you find an algorithm

327
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,120
that supports the the basic underlying

328
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,839
principles

329
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,760
of the function you want to perform

330
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,760
uh there are a number of examples

331
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,079
um here and and you can go to these

332
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,399
sites and and play around with it

333
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,440
uh ibm has been working on this uh in

334
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,000
terms of

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,199
addition and multiplication microsoft

336
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
um in addition to their election guard

337
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,480
is probably a separate project but

338
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,839
they are working on addition and

339
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,399
multiplication and the seal

340
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,680
algorithm is there google is looking at

341
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,519
uh some stuff that's slightly different

342
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,360
they are looking at comparison again we

343
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,920
looked at

344
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,279
search and exact match and

345
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,320
limited edition uh under the name of

346
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,759
private join and computer

347
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,160
interesting uh project there if you want

348
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,680
to look at other examples

349
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,880
homomorphicencryption.org the the

350
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,240
introduction

351
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,920
uh section of that site lists a number

352
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,399
of

353
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,800
projects that are going on and and so

354
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,399
you can go there

355
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,519
um you can find the the write-ups you

356
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,240
can find

357
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
the the actual code um and

358
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
and play around with it yourself to see

359
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,959
uh how this works and how well

360
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,040
and is everybody still awake

361
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,639
uh so this is uh just a little bit of a

362
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,639
break any any questions

363
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,440
so far

364
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,839
[Music]

365
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,600
don't seem to have had any on that the

366
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
chat and hopefully

367
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
see aaron will let me know if anybody uh

368
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,720
no no

369
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
none so far yeah rob i think most people

370
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,839
are waiting for the end

371
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,360
okay i'll keep it in the end

372
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
good ask it now um so one of the things

373
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,440
i was going to ask was

374
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
do you see a time when um say things

375
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,720
like reverse 3 will be used for digital

376
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,839
voting systems like

377
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,279
and that will become the standard in the

378
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,079
future a lot of places are still on

379
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,120
paper

380
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,839
they kind of stick to what they know so

381
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,240
yeah

382
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
as i say the the three voting system can

383
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
be used on

384
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,680
on paper there there is an

385
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,839
implementation that you can use it

386
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,720
uh for a paper ballot so it would be a

387
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
more secure

388
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,319
uh paper ballot than is the existing

389
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,039
case

390
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,799
when you use the the three ballot voting

391
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,160
system if if you're doing it with a

392
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,760
paper implementation you

393
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,119
get literally three ballots um

394
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,319
and you you

395
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,919
vote um but you only drop

396
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,799
one of the three ballots into the ballot

397
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,679
box

398
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,880
you get to keep two and

399
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,640
uh the fact that you are keeping these

400
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,520
two ballots

401
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,960
allows you to verify at a later date if

402
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,559
you want

403
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,360
uh whether or not your vote actually has

404
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,679
been

405
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,559
counted so like i say you know the

406
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,840
current system

407
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,919
uh you drop your your vote in the ballot

408
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,679
box you trust in the system the the

409
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
process is there to

410
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,679
ensure that your ballot does get counted

411
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,000
but you don't know that you can't verify

412
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,960
that with the paper implementation of

413
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,039
the three ballot voting system

414
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,200
you at a later date can prove that your

415
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
your vote was or was not counted

416
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
so even even with a paper-based system

417
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,240
yes i can see the the three ballot

418
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,520
voting system

419
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,600
being used as as the basis of

420
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
improvements

421
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,240
to our existing uh voting systems

422
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,039
and certainly as uh the only thing that

423
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,200
i've been able to see in in terms of

424
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,640
a relatively safe uh online or or

425
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,480
digital voting system so um

426
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,200
oh when somebody's asked about uh

427
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,080
quantum

428
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,039
homomorphic

429
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
i'll come back to that because if i get

430
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,880
into that now i'm going to waste an

431
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
awful lot of time

432
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
but yes i i will talk about quantum

433
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,280
encryption later on anyways

434
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,360
the the thing is that homomorphic

435
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,559
encryption

436
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,320
um while it's it you know it's a lovely

437
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,679
idea

438
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,200
um it's it's not perfect

439
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
it isn't the holy grail that was

440
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,799
mentioned in the

441
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,679
the media headline first of all it's not

442
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,080
a

443
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,760
thing um there's

444
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,240
all kinds of functions and

445
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,600
implementation

446
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,160
just like blockchain you know i i want

447
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
to get myself a t-shirt that says

448
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
blockchain is not the answer

449
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,559
i don't care what the question is

450
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,240
blockchain is not the answer because

451
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,200
blockchain

452
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
is not a thing it's a bunch of different

453
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,559
functions uh

454
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,039
collection of functions and

455
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,600
implementations that are all over

456
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,640
everywhere um

457
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,360
uh yes daniel i will answer that

458
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,240
question

459
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,480
um anyways uh it's

460
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,880
not universal homomorphic encryption

461
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,600
when you do it you have to choose your

462
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,559
function

463
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,240
in advance the function that you want to

464
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,120
perform

465
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,280
determines how you encrypt the data

466
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,760
and and so it isn't just a thing where

467
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,320
you

468
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,360
you know perform you know encrypted with

469
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
homomorphic encryption and then you can

470
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,840
do

471
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
anything you want with it at a later

472
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,200
date you have to choose

473
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,120
what you want to do with it first now

474
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,320
uh yes we're we're going to talk

475
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
a little bit about cryptography here do

476
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,000
not fret

477
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,159
uh the mathematics i i'm not going to

478
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,000
get into the mathematics here

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,840
but we all know about symmetric

480
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
versus asymmetric encryption symmetric

481
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
encryption you use the same key you use

482
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,960
a single key you have to share the key

483
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,200
and that's the problem the uh

484
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,840
the symmetric encryption i mean

485
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
symmetric encryption is strong we know

486
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
how strong it is we know how long it's

487
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,120
going to take how how long we can ensure

488
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,520
that the uh data is protected

489
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,000
with symmetric encryption but we've

490
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,080
we've got to manage the key and if you

491
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,360
uh you know can't manage the key

492
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,360
um we have a real problem and

493
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,600
uh there's all kinds of systems

494
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
including yes daniel quantum

495
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,240
encryption uh which is not quite

496
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,280
encryption actually

497
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,320
it is key exchange quantum key exchange

498
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,280
and that's all to support symmetric

499
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,080
encryption now

500
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,559
asymmetric encryption uh

501
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,600
we we don't have any problem with

502
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,480
the key because one key is private and

503
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
you never share that key you never tell

504
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,520
anybody

505
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,640
what your private key is whereas the

506
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,280
other key

507
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,559
is public and it you can put it in

508
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,919
phone books you can put it on bulletin

509
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,200
boards

510
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,880
billboards you can do anything you want

511
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
with it it's public

512
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,159
anybody can know your public key

513
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,480
uh and so the key management part of

514
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,679
that is

515
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,600
is done away with it and you know no no

516
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,039
problem with key management um

517
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,720
but asymmetric encryption is a lot

518
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,440
weaker than symmetric encryption and it

519
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,640
takes a lot longer

520
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,559
you need a lot more computer power so um

521
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,600
we've got this you know uh

522
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
dichotomy between symmetric and

523
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
asymmetric encryption between the

524
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,320
strength

525
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,360
and the key management and so what we

526
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,640
do with that is we have a hybrid system

527
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,840
we use the asymmetric part

528
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,559
of encryption for key management only we

529
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,679
encrypt the key

530
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,559
because it's very small and we can

531
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,080
securely pass the key

532
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
we don't have to worry about the key

533
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,679
management and having passed that

534
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,760
session key

535
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,039
we can then use symmetric encryption

536
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,919
to do all our bulk data encryption and

537
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:02,880
and that's

538
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,039
the way we do pretty much everything

539
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,440
with cryptography these days

540
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,840
you cannot do that with homomorphic

541
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
encryption

542
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,200
you have to work directly with the

543
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
encrypted data

544
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
and and so we can't have a

545
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,679
hybrid system we we have no way

546
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,039
of uh you know

547
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,039
saying that we can use you know

548
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,640
symmetric encryption for this

549
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,440
you know bulk uh encryption and

550
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
decryption of the data

551
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,280
and the homomorphic encryption is only

552
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
for key management or something like

553
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,120
that it doesn't work that way

554
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,760
so this is going to require lots and

555
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,360
lots of compute cycles

556
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,559
it is going to take an awful lot

557
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,320
to encrypt the data um and

558
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,279
to d well we're not decrypting but to

559
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,720
process

560
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,760
the encrypted data and and get a result

561
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,400
it's it's going to take more work

562
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
so uh that

563
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,159
having been the case we then go on to

564
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,840
look at the fact that we have

565
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,279
limited algorithms not everything we may

566
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,480
want to do with homomorphic encryption

567
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
with the encrypted data

568
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,080
uh do we have an algorithm for at the

569
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,799
moment

570
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,960
as i say there's a number of uh projects

571
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
looking into different types of

572
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,799
functions and and certainly there

573
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,559
is going to be ongoing work in this

574
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,840
field but

575
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,600
we don't have all the functions that we

576
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,840
may want

577
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,320
if you want to combine functions

578
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
the algorithms are going to be even more

579
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,000
limited you're

580
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,080
going to have to find an algorithm

581
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,480
that suits all the functions

582
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,520
that you want to combine

583
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
and that's going to be more difficult to

584
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,799
build the algorithm

585
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,320
and definitely more difficult in terms

586
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
of the processing that you want to do

587
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
so that's going to be a weakness we

588
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,000
can't do everything we want with it

589
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,120
um and

590
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
remember the bad examples that i gave

591
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
you earlier the sievers

592
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,679
caesar cipher that's a that's a very

593
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,799
weak

594
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,600
uh encryption system because it's got a

595
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
very limited address space

596
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,840
you know you can you know break a caesar

597
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,880
cipher with

598
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,400
brute force anytime you want and again

599
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,120
the block

600
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,720
mode the electronic code book mode of

601
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,400
block ciphers is the weakest mode

602
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,400
for uh block ciphers

603
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,159
so that is is going to limit

604
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,320
what we can do and as we

605
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,480
use different homomorphic encryption

606
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,679
systems

607
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,440
you have to pay attention to these

608
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,240
things and realize that there is

609
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
uh going to be inbuilt weaknesses

610
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,880
to this in the same way that asymmetric

611
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,520
systems and algorithms are weaker that

612
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,279
than symmetric algorithms

613
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,039
homomorphic algorithms are going to be

614
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,240
similarly weak because they limit

615
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,360
the ways you can encrypt

616
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,760
the data that you're you're dealing with

617
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,600
so uh as i said i i

618
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,520
taught a uh cissp review seminar over

619
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,320
there

620
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,799
uh some years back so this is a sample

621
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,679
question

622
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,279
which of the following is not an

623
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,000
effective deterrent against a database

624
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,320
inference attack partitioning small

625
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,120
query sets

626
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,200
noise and perturbation and cell

627
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
suppression

628
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,559
and this is one that always throws

629
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,960
people because the actual correct

630
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,559
answer and there is noise and

631
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,240
perturbation and p you say that

632
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,279
people and they say you know what uh are

633
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,679
you

634
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,520
talking about you know nobody wants to

635
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,200
put noise and perturbation into their

636
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,840
results

637
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,960
but you do sometimes if you want to

638
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,360
uh keep data private and i'd talk about

639
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,880
that in a different presentation on

640
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,960
differential uh

641
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,320
privacy but the

642
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,000
the thing is that we may want to do

643
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,240
different things with our data

644
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
and homomorphic encryption is going to

645
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,640
definitely limit us in terms of what we

646
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,840
can and cannot do

647
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,799
in in these systems now uh

648
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,840
the the accuracy of the data and the

649
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,559
accuracy of the results

650
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,279
is another limitation here another

651
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,399
weakness

652
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,240
um the people who have worked on

653
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,600
homomorphic encryption

654
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,760
and and again you can go out and look at

655
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,120
the research there

656
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,559
uh but uh a writer named gentry has

657
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,440
uh proposed something that he refers to

658
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,919
as

659
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,760
fully homomorphic encryption because

660
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,279
he is looking at

661
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,520
what you can do in terms of homomorphic

662
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,559
encryption

663
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,039
and still get completely accurate

664
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,320
results

665
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,360
from the functions that you perform on

666
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,559
it so that's an

667
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,960
you know an an interesting uh

668
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,159
examination

669
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,039
and again a limitation of what you can

670
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:31,919
do

671
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,200
with homomorphic encryption

672
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,720
uh microsoft is going to be using

673
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
uh is promising us that they are going

674
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,760
to be doing

675
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,960
uh homomorphic encryption guarding

676
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
your passwords the passwords that you

677
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,520
have in microsoft edge well

678
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,520
first of all everybody has been storing

679
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,520
passwords uh in in hashed form

680
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,080
and as i said before you know that's

681
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,799
basically

682
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,840
a form of homomorphic encryption so

683
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,799
you know this is not something new and

684
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,760
um

685
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,080
besides what what microsoft is promising

686
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,279
to do in edge

687
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,200
microsoft chrome has been doing that for

688
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,559
years

689
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,080
in any case so um you know

690
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,918
this is uh

691
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,880
this is something that you were going to

692
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,520
see

693
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,840
um with with a lot of these new

694
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,080
technologies with uh

695
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,320
homomorphic encryption with differential

696
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,240
privacy with quantum

697
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,640
uh cryptography and that sort of thing

698
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,039
you have to figure out what the people

699
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,399
are actually doing with it um

700
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,360
vendors are going to be promising you

701
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,919
things

702
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,480
uh taught you using the latest buzzwords

703
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,760
uh but you you do

704
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,559
have to know what it is that they're

705
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,080
talking about

706
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
um to determine whether what they're

707
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,279
promising you

708
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,000
is actually uh you know homomorphic

709
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,679
encryption or quantum cryptography or

710
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,279
whatever it is

711
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,720
and whether or not it actually is an

712
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,000
improvement for you

713
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,039
a a benefit for you so

714
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,480
uh you know that's basically that the

715
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,360
whole point

716
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,799
of uh what i've

717
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,039
you know this this presentation now

718
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,720
uh before i ask sharon for uh

719
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,240
some more questions um quantum

720
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,559
homomorphic ed

721
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
um

722
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
you have 15 minutes here rob uh if

723
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,360
that's the only question so you can you

724
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,200
can use the time as much as you like

725
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,039
okay well we'll see we'll see if anybody

726
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,720
comes up with any other questions but

727
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,640
um yes quantum cryptography i love this

728
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,480
because i have i have yet another

729
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,399
presentation on

730
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,559
uh security implications for quantum

731
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,440
computing and there is in fact a

732
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,000
difference

733
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,399
between quantum computing and quantum

734
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,159
cryptography

735
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,600
and there is in fact a difference

736
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,679
between quantum cryptography

737
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,080
and cryptography quantum cryptography

738
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,640
is not cryptography quantum cryptography

739
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,000
is simply another way of key exchange

740
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
it's a very expensive way of key

741
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,440
exchange

742
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,159
originally you had to have dedicated

743
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,279
single mode

744
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,720
fiber optic cable to do key exchange

745
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,799
with quantum cryptography

746
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,840
and if you've got dedicated single mode

747
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,320
fiber optic cable why do you need

748
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,519
cryptography

749
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,799
i mean you've got you know

750
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,880
not completely untappable i've had this

751
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,039
argument with guys from the nsa

752
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,720
but um you have

753
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,679
uh the most untappable system that there

754
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,640
is

755
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,039
and and so you know that's that's one

756
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,840
part of it

757
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,799
but as i say quantum cryptography is

758
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,960
just key exchange it's not a new means

759
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
of cryptography

760
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,360
now where cryptography comes in is

761
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,240
uh the shore and and some of the other

762
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,640
algorithms that are

763
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,960
proposed for

764
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,240
uh quantum computers

765
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,799
and quantum computers the theory is that

766
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,919
quantum computers

767
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,640
will be able to break encryption but you

768
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,159
have to have

769
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,440
an algorithm to break the encryption and

770
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,080
the

771
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,919
the short algorithm for example to use

772
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,279
one is

773
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,919
proposed as an attack on rsa but it's

774
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,799
only an attack on rsa it can

775
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,600
be used on on other uh

776
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,159
crypto algorithms that use mod functions

777
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,840
in in particular

778
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,200
but it's uh

779
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,159
you know it's uh

780
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,679
not exactly theoretical it does work

781
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,039
but only if we have a quantum computer

782
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,039
and at the moment

783
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,320
uh the real quantum computers

784
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,760
are limited to you know

785
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,120
uh qubits in the double digits in order

786
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,519
to

787
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,799
break an rsa key

788
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,240
of 4000 bits which

789
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,919
is not unreasonable you are going to

790
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,000
have to have

791
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,039
a quantum computer

792
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,120
full quantum computer with at least

793
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,120
8 000 cubits so you know we've got

794
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,519
double digits right now we've got to go

795
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,200
to you know at least 8

796
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,240
000 qubits um you know there's a few

797
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,480
orders of magnitude in there before we

798
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,679
have to worry

799
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,800
about people breaking rsa keys now

800
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,320
there is a quantum

801
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,440
computing system uh

802
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,359
that's a little bit larger that is the d

803
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,719
wave system and i know about that

804
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,480
because that's over in burnaby it's you

805
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
know not 20 miles from where i'm

806
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,159
sitting here but uh that is

807
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,960
not that that is best described as

808
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
probably a quantum co-processor

809
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,639
uh that's not a fully uh functioning

810
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,320
quantum computer so

811
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,119
uh that is you know there's there's

812
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,239
limitations there

813
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,679
now uh i assume that

814
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,839
when you say quantum homomorphic your

815
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,119
talking there uh

816
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,520
okay you've given me a url uh i'll

817
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,119
go and have a look at that and maybe we

818
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,200
can talk about that

819
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,560
if you fire me your uh email address

820
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,640
uh anyways you can you can contact me by

821
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,680
email

822
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,720
um okay a few more uh

823
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,640
questions have come in here uh

824
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,440
yeah quite a few is this something that

825
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
could replace the current pki

826
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,200
basically no i mean it's a different

827
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
system um

828
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,240
if you don't need to decrypt the uh

829
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,000
the function of course you don't need

830
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
pki because you don't need asymmetric

831
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,280
encryption you don't need the key

832
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,760
exchange and that sort of thing

833
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,000
but it's only going to be useful in

834
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,760
fairly limited situations

835
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,320
is there any solid homomorphic

836
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
encryption solution available that is

837
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,599
reliable

838
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,000
and can be deployed on an industrial

839
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,560
scale such as in public cloud

840
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,079
um yes

841
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,280
again the uh the ones that i uh

842
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
sent you and and i fired all the links

843
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,119
from

844
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
the presentation here into the chat so

845
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,359
if you go into the chat and pick that up

846
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,720
um you'll be able to see those uh things

847
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,160
um those systems are

848
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,079
available i mean you can even get the

849
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,760
source code

850
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,160
they are reliable they can be deployed

851
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,640
on a an industrial scale

852
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,800
but only for those specific functions

853
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,359
again you're limited to those uh the

854
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,320
functions that those

855
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,760
projects uh have looked at

856
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,640
and uh you mentioned that homomorphic

857
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,839
encryption requires lots more cpus

858
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,000
cycles what rough order of magnitude

859
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,560
would you mean

860
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,000
that i

861
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,400
i have not done the math in in terms of

862
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,520
how much more

863
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,320
uh i'm just going to say you know number

864
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,680
one

865
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,319
it's going to be you know as

866
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,280
compute intensive as asymmetric

867
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,920
encryption

868
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,040
or more and we know that

869
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,800
the processing of uh in in asymmetric

870
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
rather than symmetric encryption

871
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,079
is uh a hundred to a thousand times uh

872
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,920
more intense and the um

873
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,359
we we cannot as i say um use the same

874
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,599
type of of hybrid

875
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,680
uh uh combinations

876
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
um that we could with asymmetric and

877
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,359
symmetric encryption as

878
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,680
as i mentioned there um

879
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,240
what's the most feasible likely use case

880
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,320
for homomorphic encryption based on the

881
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,000
current research well

882
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,599
it's not the current research i'd say

883
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,119
the voting system

884
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,200
um we uh

885
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,040
you know there are the um

886
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,560
uh the comparisons matching um

887
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,480
uh as i say you know we've been using

888
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
that for for password protection for

889
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,040
years so

890
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,280
you know we are using it there there are

891
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,440
a bunch of of things that we can use it

892
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,320
for

893
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,240
uh but there are also a number of things

894
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,520
that we

895
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,480
we would like to do uh while still

896
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,359
protecting

897
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,560
and and keeping data encrypted

898
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
um and we simply haven't got the

899
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,119
algorithms yet to do that

900
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,160
so that seems to cover what's come in so

901
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,640
far

902
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,640
any any further discussions

903
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,240
nothing yet on on the uh on the chat um

904
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
rob you've made my job very easy as mc

905
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,520
you you've done

906
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,960
done all the questioning for me which

907
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,800
was uh which is fantastic i could just

908
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,520
sit back and

909
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,920
have a coffee um well very very

910
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,440
interesting talk rob um

911
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,359
thank you very much um we might just

912
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,200
give folks another minute or two just to

913
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
see if they

914
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,839
um have any additional questions and uh

915
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,200
then we can then you and it

916
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,240
um do duke it out on a separate channel

917
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,480
to

918
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,760
quantum encryption yeah so

919
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,400
nothing nothing else has come in rob um

920
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
so once again thanks for your time today

921
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,560
um very interesting talk you're quite

922
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,920
welcome and and i guess

923
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,880
people have uh four minutes to to run to

924
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,079
the bathroom before

925
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,200
uh chat comes on deck and you'll want to

926
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,480
listen to chat

927
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,960
yeah absolutely thanks again rob i hope

928
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,240
you see you're welcome

929
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,839
dublin sometime again

930
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
you
