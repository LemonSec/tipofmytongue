1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
so my name is jennifer cox and i've been

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,599
working in the tech industry for

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,719
15 years now this year uh the last five

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,200
of them

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,120
was tenable working with our existing

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,480
customer base and

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,160
helping to consult and advise them on

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
best practices when it comes

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,840
to cyber security and everything around

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,240
that

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,080
really but today what i'm going to do is

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
talk about something that is more of a

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,760
personal interest of mine and really

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,000
doesn't bear any direct relation i guess

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,440
to what i do as a job

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,040
so we'll start from the beginning so

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
what is social engineering

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,480
and some of you may have heard of

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,640
somebody called kevin mitnick i would

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,000
like to think so anyway if you have an

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
interest in social engineering at all

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,000
he's a very high profile hacker who

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,440
spent five years in prison

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
and as a result of his talents shall we

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,559
say

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,960
and he almost exclusively helped to

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,039
popularize the term social engineering

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,199
back in the 1990s and he made a career

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
out of what it was that he does

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,120
and now he runs his own security

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
consultancy firm and he's an author of a

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,799
number of different books

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,159
around social engineering that i would

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,920
absolutely recommend that you

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,080
read if you get a chance to so his

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
definition of social engineering taken

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
directly from his art of deception book

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,159
in social engineering uses influence and

39
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,080
persuasion to deceive people by

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
convincing them that the social engineer

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,280
is somebody he isn't

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
or by manipulation much better than any

43
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,119
of those dictionary definitions it

44
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
actually makes sense but it is doing

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,439
and of course with the nature of

46
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,720
anything and

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
in the in the world wonderful world of

48
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
i.t and security and cyber

49
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,960
and the terms tend to change over time

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,560
so i'm just putting up a list there of a

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,040
few

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,920
of i want to say the the lesser known

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,360
terms when it comes to social

54
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
engineering you may well know

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,600
um some of them i may well not know any

56
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,240
of them

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
i'll cover a couple but i won't go

58
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
through them all in any great detail

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,399
because then there's quite a bit that i

60
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,240
want to cover today but just to

61
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
to cover the base grain a base level as

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
such so things like spearfishing would

63
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,119
be targeting

64
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
and a high level contact someone like a

65
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,479
ceo of a company

66
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,920
but using pre-texting um with regards

67
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,759
researching and finding finding out

68
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,520
information in relation to that

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,319
individual and making it a very targeted

70
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,599
approach so you're not just looking for

71
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,360
general information or doing something

72
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,080
like

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
phishing where you're sending a name an

74
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
email out to

75
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,520
a mass number of targets and hoping that

76
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,040
somebody will click on it

77
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,319
in this particular case you'll be

78
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,160
gathering information very specific to

79
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,959
that individual

80
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,319
whether it's on a professional or a

81
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
personal basis in order to make your

82
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
your attack um much more targeted in its

83
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,480
approach

84
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
and then there's a physical type of

85
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,840
social engineering so something like

86
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,879
tailgating

87
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,360
it sounds so simple and works so

88
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,160
effectively

89
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
so where you would um pretend to be

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
somebody that you're not such as maybe a

91
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
delivery person and you're holding the

92
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,519
box and you ask somebody to hold the

93
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,800
door open for you

94
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,680
um in order to gain entry into an office

95
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
building or

96
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
whatever the building is then from there

97
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
so all you need to do is be pretty

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
convincing whether it's the clothes you

99
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,920
wear or the disposition that you have

100
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,480
and they'll let you through the door in

101
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,360
most cases without any questions asked

102
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,720
and then at the bottom of the list there

103
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
is something we've seen more activity on

104
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
recently which is smishing and that's

105
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,840
around

106
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
getting text messages with links so and

107
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,720
there was a spate of bank ones

108
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,519
last year and click on these details to

109
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,239
confirm

110
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,879
your online login details and things

111
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,000
like

112
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,159
confirm your coverage vaccine

113
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,200
appointment

114
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000
and your parcel delivery and we're

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,760
seeing an increased amount

116
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,480
an increased um increase in those kind

117
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,400
of attacks especially

118
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,319
susceptible to people who maybe aren't

119
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,599
as technical

120
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,360
but um and all the same still happening

121
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
and then the chances are when it comes

122
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
to social engineering on some level you

123
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,000
have done it

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,920
as well so you may not be thinking

125
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,040
woohoo i'm a social

126
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
engineer uh and all of the different

127
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,879
terminology around it but if you stop

128
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,879
for a minute and think about it in its

129
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,720
most simple form as such and let's say

130
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,519
in theory that when you were younger um

131
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:07,920
you

132
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,959
or a friend uh that you know

133
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,200
uh use the fake id in order to buy

134
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,799
alcohol not that this happens a whole

135
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,680
lot but

136
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,199
that's the same idea it's very simple

137
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,560
that they're using something to convince

138
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,918
a person that they are something that

139
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,479
they're not in order to gain

140
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,880
to win or gain some property in this

141
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
case from that individual which would be

142
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,759
the alcohol

143
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,000
or maybe you went into a cinema at 15

144
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,560
years of age to see an over 12's movie

145
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,759
and then dodged out of that one and

146
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,080
waiting to see the over 18s the same

147
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
idea you've gained access to something

148
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
that you shouldn't have gained access to

149
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
under the pretext of being somebody that

150
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,960
you're not and most people

151
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,880
do it with it without realizing to do

152
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
this shoulder surfing as

153
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,240
uh we would refer to another one of the

154
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
tactics so let's say you're on public

155
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,919
transport you're sitting on a train

156
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,080
you're bored the scenery is not so good

157
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
uh the person beside just answering

158
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
emails on their phone or arguing with

159
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,840
their

160
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
boyfriend and watching something on

161
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
netflix

162
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
typing away on their laptop it's often

163
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
more interesting to just have a look at

164
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
what they're doing

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,479
and without realizing that often these

166
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,000
people can give away a significant

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
amount of information about themselves

168
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,120
um in a very very small space of time

169
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
so for me uh i would say recently but

170
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,039
it's when we used to be able to fly last

171
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,240
and we all know that that's not been

172
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
very recent

173
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,039
so i was on a plane we were sitting on

174
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,560
the tarmac our flight was going to be

175
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
delayed for

176
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,479
40 minutes um so i thought i'll amuse

177
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,199
myself and

178
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,280
let's see what mischief i can get up to

179
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
really and what information i can find

180
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,600
out

181
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
about the people sitting closest to me

182
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
so i'm in a three

183
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,199
seat row i'm sitting by the window

184
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,000
there's a

185
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
gentleman sitting beside me and then a

186
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
lady beside him none of us knew each

187
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,919
other

188
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
um but fortunately for me the man who

189
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,199
sat beside me obviously forgot his

190
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,240
reading glasses

191
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,560
and held his phone a good 18 inches away

192
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,520
from his face

193
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,440
while he was using it which meant that i

194
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,680
could easily do some shoulder surfing

195
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
without him having any idea that i was

196
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,479
doing it because i didn't even have to

197
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,919
turn my head to look at what he was

198
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,880
doing

199
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,960
and while i was having a look um in the

200
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,800
space of maybe five or six minutes i

201
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
managed to identify

202
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,440
the company that i was working for and

203
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,080
they used a full name and full surname

204
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
in the email

205
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,479
address and then the email address for

206
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
the name of the company obviously so i

207
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
was able to search for him on linkedin

208
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
find out his role find out what he did

209
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,800
and find out what his company did it was

210
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
an engineering manufacturing

211
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
um and then he was on whatsapp talking

212
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
to his family he had two

213
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,960
uh adult children he was talking to his

214
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,280
wife about the hotel he was staying in

215
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
the days he was coming back when he

216
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,680
expected to be arriving at the hotel

217
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,160
where he had parked his car and simple

218
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
conversation that he was

219
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,120
innocently having with his family and i

220
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,680
was and clocking up all of this

221
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,520
data this information about him and yet

222
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
i've not even spoken to him at most bump

223
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
elbows at this point

224
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,039
but the most interesting thing is right

225
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,039
up to that point he wasn't

226
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,120
an interesting target and i had no

227
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
intentions of exploiting this particular

228
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
individual it's just an interesting

229
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
exercise to pass the time

230
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,199
and but the next thing that he did after

231
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,919
that was he went on to a website

232
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,440
where he was looking at bids for antique

233
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
coins and these coins then were haven't

234
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,360
been submitted against him and he

235
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,520
also placed some bids against these

236
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,199
coins which were in the between the

237
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,120
value of about two thousand euro up to

238
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
about ten thousand euro

239
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
so of course this individual who was

240
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
doing nothing more exciting than the

241
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,039
person next to him

242
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,880
uh right up to that moment wasn't an

243
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,639
interesting target but as soon as he was

244
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,400
putting a ten thousand dollar bid on an

245
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
antique coin he suddenly became way more

246
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,759
interesting to me

247
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,440
but like i say in that space of time

248
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
just for the sake of amusement i was

249
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
able to find out quite a lot about his

250
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,840
employer employer himself his employment

251
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
the amount of money that he clearly has

252
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
and to play with his family his location

253
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,360
his intended behavior over the next few

254
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,000
days

255
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
and i didn't have to try i didn't even

256
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,919
have to ask him any questions and that's

257
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,440
just using the shoulder surfing

258
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,160
technique

259
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,319
then from there and like say the chances

260
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,680
are you've seen some information like

261
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,039
that from individuals

262
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,720
without even realizing that it doesn't

263
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
make you or nor me

264
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,879
um excellent at it but it certainly

265
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,000
shows you how easily

266
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
some of these tactics can be used so

267
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,800
recently we've had a few high-profile

268
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
human attacks as i'll uh call them and

269
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,240
very recently

270
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,639
2020 2021 everything obviously

271
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,680
everything is

272
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,919
massively different uh between this year

273
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,440
and last year so it's made some of these

274
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
things a little bit more interesting

275
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,720
and specifically what we've had

276
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,319
is uh an attack in 2020 summer 2020

277
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,640
um on twitter so there was three

278
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
individuals who managed to use means of

279
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,039
social engineering to get

280
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,240
information from twitter employees

281
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
around the admin platform

282
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
and for twitter so it meant that they

283
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
were able to get access

284
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
to pretty much any twitter users

285
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,839
logins and posts identification with

286
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,200
regards verified accounts and things

287
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
like that behind the scenes

288
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
and they did it it's believed that they

289
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,320
did it through a chat portal

290
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
made friends with these individuals and

291
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,279
managed to get this information from

292
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,000
them

293
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
potentially and by bribing them but

294
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,519
that's unconfirmed so

295
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
i can't i cannot stick by that one but

296
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,360
what these individuals did then is once

297
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,760
they

298
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,240
got access to these accounts and most of

299
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,279
them were

300
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
uh verified so blue tick accounts

301
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,399
meaning that they'd have to

302
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,399
um confirm who they are use some form of

303
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
identification and they probably have a

304
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
significant number of followers then as

305
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
well in order to be a fair verified

306
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
account

307
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,080
these individuals targeted 130 accounts

308
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,120
and and 45 of them they managed to

309
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,680
successfully hack

310
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,160
so that means that of those 45 accounts

311
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
so there are people like joe biden

312
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
and before he was the president elon

313
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
musk and then former president barack

314
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,880
obama i think

315
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
kim kardashian so once i have a

316
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
significant number of followers

317
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
they posted cryptocurrency links via

318
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,399
these people's sites

319
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,760
and of course people who follow them

320
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,279
there's always going to be some believed

321
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,959
because it was from a verified user that

322
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,480
these links were in fact

323
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,800
genuine even though the link stated send

324
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
your cryptocurrency here and we will

325
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,360
send you back

326
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,160
double and most of us in the area that

327
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
we work in i would like to think

328
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,160
would see that as a suspicious activity

329
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,680
but there's always some

330
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,760
and as a result in a very short space of

331
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
time these individuals managed to steal

332
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
over 118 000

333
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
but of course the the immaturity of

334
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,920
their attack as such meant that people

335
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
reported them pretty quickly they were

336
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,000
then

337
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,320
discovered and arrested and didn't get

338
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,600
any further than that but a hundred and

339
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
eight thousand dollars is not a small um

340
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
win for such such a small amount of

341
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,240
effort i guess from there

342
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,920
and then there's the instagram russia

343
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,839
attack so what happened here

344
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
is that the social engineers managed to

345
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,279
target some fake news posts

346
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,760
on instagram so they pretended to be one

347
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,800
of the three straight

348
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
state-run television networks and

349
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
announced the government payout scheme

350
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
so all people had to do was to click on

351
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,720
the link and enter in their

352
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,480
um bank details their personal

353
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,160
information and the equivalent of their

354
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
pps number in order to get their payout

355
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,200
from the government

356
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
or at least that's how it seemed and it

357
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,720
was a pretty successful attack

358
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
successful enough to make headline news

359
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
in russia um

360
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,079
and they very easily managed to get that

361
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,839
personally identified information from

362
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,519
individuals on the head of a promise of

363
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,839
cash in their pocket then one of the

364
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,640
more recent

365
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,160
uh and more i guess uh common

366
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,600
types that we've seen now are the

367
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
fishing attacks across

368
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
things like an amazon prime day or black

369
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,640
friday

370
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,959
christmas because people are working

371
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,320
from home and

372
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
a lot of the stores have been closed and

373
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
everybody's locked down basically a lot

374
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
of our transactions more than ever

375
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,959
before being done

376
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,800
online and people are much more

377
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,640
dependent on basic things

378
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,440
through this means so getting an email

379
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,160
perfectly

380
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,480
timed saying that your transaction has

381
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
failed and your order won't arrive

382
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
um is catching more and more people out

383
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
in 2020 than it would have done

384
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,959
previously

385
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,639
fishing still proven to be a pretty

386
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,480
successful means of attack

387
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
and with that you'll have people

388
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
entering in their bank details credit

389
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
card details personal information

390
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,519
passwords for the sites

391
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,959
and readily handing it over and

392
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,399
especially around times like christmas

393
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,480
where you're waiting for maybe

394
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
um special personal gifts to arrive and

395
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
um

396
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
you uh people will panic when they see

397
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
it and think that this isn't going to

398
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,279
arrive the delivery as hell will put in

399
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,720
their information before thoroughly

400
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,959
vetting the details that are there

401
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,480
in often cases when it comes to things

402
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,079
like phishing attacks most people will

403
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,120
see through them

404
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,760
and you know most people are capable of

405
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,160
that

406
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
it's all about perfect timing if you're

407
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
particularly stressed

408
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,079
um let's say about that package come in

409
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:32,880
for christmas

410
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,600
and you get an email right at that

411
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,040
precise moment where you're stressing

412
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
the most about it or there's not enough

413
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,279
time for it to arrive

414
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,920
of course that's a very um perfect

415
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,200
opportunity for you to click on these

416
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,000
things

417
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
and then finally and uh something that

418
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
we've seen since 2020

419
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,720
is covet related attacks so we're seeing

420
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,880
more and more and smishing attacks where

421
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,639
people are getting text messages around

422
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,120
uh contacts close contacts that have

423
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,839
been

424
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,560
um that they've been that they've been

425
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,600
in contact with

426
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
are vaccine appointments and promises

427
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
to you know register your information

428
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
here and to get details from that

429
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,399
and then of course uh phishing emails

430
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,760
around the same thing

431
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
i know that jason showed us some of

432
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
those in his and

433
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
his uh delivery this morning and then

434
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,040
calls from people saying that they're

435
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
from health services

436
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,360
and want to set up appointments and to

437
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,440
confirm personal information from there

438
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,480
and fear is what and means what enables

439
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,120
people to

440
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
hand over this kind of information for

441
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
these attacks because everybody wants

442
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,519
their vaccine and everybody wants the

443
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,639
world to go back to

444
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,720
whatever the new normal is going to be

445
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,399
so they'll hand over that information

446
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,760
readily

447
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,480
into these calls and from there so what

448
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,199
can you do

449
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,160
to prevent against social engineering

450
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,240
and social engineering humans obviously

451
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,839
there's a lot of technical capabilities

452
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,360
that you can put in place

453
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,600
and to to protect your network and

454
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,120
protect your infrastructure and protect

455
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,920
your building

456
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
but today what we're concerned about is

457
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,920
how we best deal with our humans

458
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,079
and help them to protect us and our

459
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,279
businesses from there

460
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,800
so it seems obvious we talk about

461
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
security awareness training

462
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
we want to make sure that everybody has

463
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
all of the basics so you're talking

464
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
about these super simple basics like

465
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,760
clean desk policies that storage

466
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
when you have your um employees going

467
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
back to the office fairmont for a lot of

468
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,760
companies they've been out of their

469
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,560
offices for

470
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,120
up to a year and now we have to remind

471
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
them not only this is you know

472
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,639
uh not normal to i don't know break wind

473
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,680
in front of your

474
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,519
colleagues because you've been at home

475
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,120
working in your home office for so long

476
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
but it's also good to remind them of

477
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
some of these habits that they should

478
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,079
have in place not leaving

479
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,680
personally identifying information on

480
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
the desk having lock storage to put it

481
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,320
into

482
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
using that lock storage shredding

483
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,079
confidential information and then if

484
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:44,959
they're dealing with

485
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
and personally identifying information

486
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
that they have additional gdpr training

487
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,720
alongside that so that they're aware of

488
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
the implications for the company when it

489
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,600
comes to things like

490
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,519
fines and for mistreating that

491
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,680
information or it being

492
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,320
exposed in some way and then for those

493
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
on the access side of things it's a

494
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
perfect time and it should happen

495
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
often to review ids and review

496
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,160
and permissions you'll have people who

497
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,839
won't return to the office straight away

498
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,000
some who will return part-time some who

499
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
will be on sickly for extended periods

500
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,079
it's really important to check that and

501
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,760
they'll be in different roles so it's

502
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,120
really important to check that their

503
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,079
access

504
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,920
does continue to match the role that

505
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,639
they have and that

506
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,480
it's updated on a regular basis then

507
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,759
from there

508
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,199
but the most important thing when it

509
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,079
comes to um

510
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
enabling your employees is the

511
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,839
simulation and the testing

512
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,040
side of things so um it's again it's

513
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,160
something that jason mentioned earlier

514
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,279
this morning that it's much more

515
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,040
important that people feel

516
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,079
these incidents than just doing

517
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,399
10 minute training once a year where

518
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,839
they take the box and say i've done the

519
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,600
video and now i'm good for my

520
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
and my social engineering or anti-social

521
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
engineering training for the air

522
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
that's not effective you're talking

523
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,519
about humans and if humans are

524
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,279
constantly interacting with something

525
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
then it's much more likely that it's

526
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
going to be an automatic process for

527
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,480
them to question what's happening around

528
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,120
them

529
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,040
and if you are facilitating training

530
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,320
once a year

531
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
that's not going to be effective and

532
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
it's really about considering the weight

533
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,839
of importance of that protection via

534
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,199
your humans

535
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,360
um and simulated intestine is the best

536
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
way to do that if somebody has

537
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,199
been has clicked the phishing link has

538
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,720
given the details over the phone and

539
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,160
then they have to be

540
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,240
a part of a discussion afterwards about

541
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,519
what they've done

542
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,240
and how to not do it again then they're

543
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
going to remember that conversation a

544
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,040
lot better than they're going to

545
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,079
remember

546
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,959
a white page article but a couple of

547
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,160
paragraphs about how

548
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,519
you know what best practices are out

549
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
there that aren't real to them

550
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,800
and social media sharing it's important

551
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,920
to make your employees aware of the

552
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,320
the risks of social media sharing so

553
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,120
it's not just

554
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,000
about the company sharing information

555
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,680
that may be sensitive to the company or

556
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,160
pictures

557
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,440
of the office or photos of people in the

558
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,799
office that might show screens in the

559
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,199
background it extends beyond that

560
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,760
if your employees are sharing and

561
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,880
personal information

562
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,439
on social media like they're they were

563
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,959
promoted and they were promoted into a

564
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,640
significantly senior role or one that

565
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,319
has a financial uplift that's worth

566
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,280
talking about

567
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,039
and they mentioned that they may start

568
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,559
seeing themselves and

569
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,599
or they may start becoming a target of a

570
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
social and

571
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
social engineer within your company and

572
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,760
it's very

573
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,039
um it's very easily overlooked but what

574
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,039
you'd be asking to do is to advise them

575
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,799
you can't make them do it but to advise

576
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,000
them of the risks and make sure that

577
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,640
they're aware of these kind of things

578
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
then branded workwear is a funny one i

579
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
love a free t-shirt same as anybody else

580
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,799
but when it comes to branded work where

581
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
i would say that there's one place i

582
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
wouldn't recommend wearing it

583
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and that is in and around the office

584
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,440
wear it anywhere that you want

585
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,400
but for me most offices these days have

586
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,039
key cards to get access into the office

587
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,520
and people will wear their their shirts

588
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
and their hoodies and such with the

589
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
brand on it so if they're going out for

590
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
their lunch they're kind of a walk-in

591
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,640
advertisement

592
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,360
and for the business which is great but

593
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,039
once they have the key cards stuck in

594
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,080
their back pocket or

595
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,760
on the back of their phone or they're at

596
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,200
risk of dropping it or losing it

597
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,080
somewhere

598
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
and they've done that whilst advertising

599
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,440
the company that it belongs to and the

600
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,720
access that's there

601
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
so i would be inclined to ask them to

602
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,320
just cover up their logos

603
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
and or not wear them around the office

604
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,440
and

605
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
embrace all of that those that free work

606
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,720
where

607
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
anywhere else that they are but that's

608
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,160
the only place i'd recommend not doing

609
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,120
it

610
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
and then for the those who have to keep

611
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,960
the asset infrastructure in place

612
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,160
or the acid and the

613
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,520
assets in place uh i would recommend

614
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,200
against non-brand or

615
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,000
against using branded asset tax so it

616
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,679
looks really cool having the company

617
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,240
logo

618
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,760
on your asset tags but um again if you

619
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,000
have

620
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,240
employees and even though the best of uh

621
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
intentions they may not want to

622
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,280
work on trains or planes or buses but if

623
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
they have they're they're using their

624
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
phones or using their their laptops and

625
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,919
so on from there

626
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,320
and and they have a sticker on it with

627
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
an asset tag number and the logo

628
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
or the name of the company then again

629
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,400
it's kind of like a walking

630
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,720
advertisement to the potential social

631
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,320
engineer with regards then being a

632
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
target or whether the

633
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
the kit that they're carrying around is

634
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,360
likely to be of any value or have any

635
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,559
and data on it

636
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,320
and that's before you get into obviously

637
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,760
the technical protection that you have

638
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,120
in place but

639
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
the technical protection protection

640
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,559
isn't a worry if there's no risk that

641
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,240
your employees are going to expose the

642
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,600
data like that so

643
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
i would recommend using aspects of

644
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
course but

645
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,120
to uh not use your logos on those asset

646
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,400
tags from there

647
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,720
then the most important thing i would

648
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,200
say is to normalize the conversation

649
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,320
if your employees are talking about um

650
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,000
social engineer hacks that they've heard

651
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
about blogs that they've read

652
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
that it's something that is always in

653
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,200
conversation whether it's true

654
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,440
and water um the

655
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
remember it's called the water

656
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,720
waterfront switching work where you're

657
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,280
talking

658
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
or uh you know any uh news blogs that go

659
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
out across the rest of your employees

660
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,799
where the

661
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,280
the names of these kind of attacks are

662
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,880
updated on the regular and everybody is

663
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,159
well informed as to

664
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,080
what's happening and how other people

665
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
that they know have been called out

666
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,559
really really easily

667
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,080
then these things are going to be at the

668
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,600
forefront of the mind and they are going

669
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,039
to think about it when they get

670
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,480
a phone call that seems perfectly

671
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,039
innocent from the tech support and

672
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,480
they're looking for their password that

673
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
it's it's natural for them

674
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,240
to want to question those conversations

675
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
again if you're only having that

676
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,960
conversation once a year

677
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,120
and it's all through paperwork or online

678
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,000
videos

679
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
then it's a whole lot less likely that

680
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
they're going to remember it when it

681
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,320
comes time

682
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,720
and then for example i have a colleague

683
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,520
who um

684
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,280
worked for a company and there's the ceo

685
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,080
of that company had set up a planned and

686
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
fake phishing attack for all the

687
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,200
employees not that unusual we've all had

688
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,520
them

689
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,559
sent to us and he organized it on friday

690
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,240
that on four o'clock on monday

691
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,760
the fake fishing email was going to go

692
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
out and

693
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
it was going to be in relation to speed

694
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,360
and tickets so he came in to

695
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,000
work on monday and uh put it around this

696
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
day as normal then this email arrived

697
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
into his inbox four o'clock as expected

698
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,400
and said that he needed to pay his

699
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,679
speeding fine

700
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,640
um urgently and he panicked because on

701
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,320
saturday morning he had of course been

702
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,000
stopped for speeding and was expecting a

703
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
ticket and was wondering how the hell

704
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,000
were they so efficient

705
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,840
that they sent this ticket now and i

706
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
don't want my wife to find out about it

707
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,320
and what am i going to do and he clicked

708
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,919
on the link and he paid his ticket

709
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,240
and as soon as he hit submit on his

710
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,039
payment

711
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,720
and that was the moment when he realized

712
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,039
that he had fallen for his own

713
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,919
attack so and then we call that a face

714
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,320
bomb

715
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
moment and then for me i've had a

716
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
a tailgating incident i guess when i

717
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
for when i was working in an office and

718
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,720
we had a new general manager that i

719
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,000
hadn't met yet

720
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,159
so i was the first person in the office

721
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,600
in the morning somebody came through the

722
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,039
door behind me

723
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,320
and and i was tempted as you would be to

724
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,720
not

725
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,840
say anything seem to know where they

726
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,039
were going and they were about to head

727
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,400
off to the desk but i thought i don't

728
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
know this person i'm the first one here

729
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,320
we have a new gm i do not want to get

730
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,600
called up on this one

731
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,440
because we have a new gym and so i

732
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,280
turned around and i introduced myself to

733
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,600
him

734
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
and told him who i was and he turned

735
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,039
around and introduced himself back to me

736
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,880
and it turns out that it was in fact our

737
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,600
new gm

738
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,080
so gold star for me thank goodness i

739
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
didn't get caught out for that one

740
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,520
so in the event of an attack if somebody

741
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
has been successfully socially

742
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,679
engineered

743
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
in your office how do you um

744
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,440
what do you do how do you get around

745
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,039
that or what do you do with regards to

746
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,320
learning from that

747
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
so the most important part i would say

748
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
is no consequences

749
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,000
i really believe that if your employees

750
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,240
feel safe in reporting an incident like

751
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,640
this

752
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,159
then you're going to be in a much better

753
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,600
position when it comes to protecting

754
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
your data

755
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,440
and protecting your employees so if

756
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,520
your employee is scared of retribution

757
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,480
and thinks they're going to get

758
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
fired for making a mistake and they

759
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,520
don't tell you about it

760
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
there's only one thing worse than

761
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
finding out that you've that someone in

762
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,480
your office has been socially engineered

763
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,919
and they've gotten the social engineers

764
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,200
got access to your network

765
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,520
and that's finding out about it days or

766
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
weeks or months or maybe not at all

767
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,320
later and so you want to make sure that

768
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,520
your employees feel comfortable

769
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,880
reporting it i mean there's always going

770
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
to be the one who's the fool and keeps

771
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,520
making mistakes all the time and you

772
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,720
deal with that separately

773
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
but for the most part people want to do

774
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,919
the right thing and they want to be good

775
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,880
people and so you want to make sure that

776
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,400
they feel comfortable reporting that

777
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,240
stuff to you then

778
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,600
and then reward them so if they do uh

779
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
notice suspicious behavior whether it's

780
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
among employees or people hanging around

781
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
outside and they report it

782
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,520
then you know reward them by whatever

783
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
means you deem necessary if they had any

784
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,000
usb

785
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
key that's clearly not belonging to the

786
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,640
company or wasn't issued by i.t

787
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,760
again good behavior handed in and if

788
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,120
they're reporting that their

789
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,880
their badge has been lost or stolen

790
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,120
within a certain amount of time or they

791
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,960
hand in one belongs to somebody else or

792
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,440
they

793
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,200
forward on an email that looks like it's

794
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
suspicious and send it on to the tech

795
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,919
department

796
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,840
all of that behavior should be rewarded

797
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,679
should be incentivized in some way

798
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,279
some people might go so far as to say it

799
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
should be gamified i do like that idea i

800
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,279
don't know how practical it is

801
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,039
but then i would certainly make sure

802
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,559
that people feel that it's the right

803
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,520
thing to do

804
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,799
because i could say for the most part

805
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,880
that's how they want to behave and then

806
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,520
if it happens if somebody does manage to

807
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,080
get

808
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
um to be socially engineered and hands

809
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
over their password or something happens

810
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,840
then review that situation you need to

811
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
sit down and talk

812
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,880
to not just them get all the details of

813
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
how it happened what was said what they

814
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,320
gave over what you did

815
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,080
to uh implement what you implemented

816
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,600
afterwards in order to protect

817
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,080
the data and the individual and the

818
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,360
company generally

819
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,080
but you need to take that review and

820
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,200
send it back

821
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,360
uh across the the greater employment

822
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,200
employee body and make sure that they're

823
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,679
aware

824
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,000
of what's happened and then the last bit

825
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,200
then is relearn

826
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,840
so again not to do the training and

827
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,799
assessment

828
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,440
uh once a year keep bringing these new

829
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
experiences into it these new

830
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
terminologies

831
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,679
anything at all and make sure that it's

832
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,039
a conversation that's happening

833
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,120
all the time the main point is that you

834
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,799
want to keep that at the forefront of

835
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,400
your employees minds

836
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,159
and otherwise they're not going to be

837
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,320
able to defend you and your data when

838
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
the time comes

839
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,840
and that is it does anybody have any

840
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
questions

841
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
thank you so much jenny for that talk

842
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,400
great insight and

843
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,320
there's no questions on the chat but i i

844
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,480
i have one myself i'd like to ask

845
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,679
so you mentioned that fiesta moment and

846
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,279
i've actually seen something similar in

847
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,200
an org one time before

848
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,679
in saying that do you think that

849
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,640
corporate fake fishing campaigns

850
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,679
um are they a necessary evil from a

851
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,360
compliance perspective

852
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
or do you actually think they work to

853
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,840
truly prepare staff for email based

854
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
social engineering attacks

855
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,600
and i know the edge case that this

856
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,760
particular one just happened to hit

857
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,600
the nail in the head from a timeliness

858
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,360
perspective but do you think they work

859
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,000
in the

860
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,520
in the mean i do because

861
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,039
if you think about it even outside of

862
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,880
the cockpit environment

863
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,799
it's working fishing is still one of the

864
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,480
most successful means of social

865
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,279
engineering

866
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,480
it hasn't really become less effective

867
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,159
so if that's the one of the ways that

868
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,840
people are more likely to get caught

869
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,120
then it makes sense to use it

870
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
in work but people should use it

871
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,640
intelligently i mean i've seen fish fake

872
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,919
fishing emails that

873
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
there's no way like a donkey could tell

874
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,120
that it's

875
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
a fake fishing email you want to put a

876
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,400
little bit of effort into making it more

877
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
convincing because they're the ones that

878
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,440
you're going to get caught on

879
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,279
and and that just takes a small bit of

880
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,720
effort on the side of the company

881
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,760
and the people with the best of

882
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
intentions you'd be surprised always

883
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
and who will get caught and almost

884
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,520
always somebody will click on it

885
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,799
obviously depending on the size of the

886
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,000
company but

887
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,640
um i don't think it's it's a negative

888
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,279
for sure

889
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,200
and people almost seem bored by it yet

890
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
they still click on the links

891
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,440
yeah and i i guess similarly we just got

892
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,559
a question in

893
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,960
and in a similar vein you mentioned you

894
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,159
know annual

895
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,120
tick box exercise white paper video

896
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,320
training

897
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,720
you know it isn't as effective as it

898
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,679
could be but

899
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,159
how would you go about it you mentioned

900
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,799
gamification as maybe a potential

901
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,080
um for improvement in the in that space

902
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,200
what's your thoughts on on that well

903
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,320
with gamification i like the idea of um

904
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,640
like a reward scheme for people who do

905
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,600
things like

906
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,039
patching quickly you know the way you

907
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,799
get a patch pushed out to your laptop

908
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,159
everybody hates it they go

909
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,600
remind me in four hours remind me

910
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,440
tomorrow remind me later and do all

911
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,799
those things but that

912
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,520
if people are rewarded for doing it

913
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,640
sooner rather than

914
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,200
than later and like say for reporting

915
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,720
different types of activity

916
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,799
it makes them interact with that whole

917
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,760
process

918
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,480
and um as a human the more interaction

919
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,320
that you have with a particular type of

920
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,559
of behavior or task or challenge whether

921
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,320
it's that you're building bricks or that

922
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,919
you're doing something like this

923
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,480
the more likely you are to retain that

924
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,360
as it

925
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,480
um as a natural uh

926
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,799
reaction and automatic process as i say

927
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,480
then after that so

928
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,799
that's i mean that's the way to do it it

929
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,640
has to be interactive it has to be more

930
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,320
hands-on that's the way to do it it has

931
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,000
to be interactive it has to be more

932
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,559
hands-on

933
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,559
sorry i'm not i'm not sure if you can

934
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,320
hear me still just turning off the video

935
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,200
there

936
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,840
okay excellent and just to wrap it up

937
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,440
one last question what's the most

938
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,600
strangest or unusual socially in

939
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,120
social engineering incident you've ever

940
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,279
come across

941
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,960
um for me it's usually the the

942
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
physical one so i've seen i

943
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,520
i guess it's more when

944
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,960
you look at those kind of like magic

945
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,799
tricks style ones where somebody

946
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,320
is using the method of distraction um

947
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,960
and uh taking something physically off

948
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,919
an individual so

949
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,559
it's like you can't fathom that i can

950
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,080
find them clicking on an email and i can

951
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,200
fathom letting somebody in the door

952
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,880
behind me we're polite people we want

953
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
people to like us and this kind of

954
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,000
behavior is natural in that sense but

955
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,679
somebody actually taking something

956
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,279
physically from me under the

957
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,679
the pretense or using the distraction

958
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,440
behaviors in order to do that

959
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,159
that kind of stuff um gets me and

960
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,039
thankfully

961
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,559
personally at least it's not as far as

962
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,919
i'm aware of i haven't been targeted

963
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:30,880
with anything

964
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,320
um more than the the person next door

965
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
but i'm always fascinated by those ones

966
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,840
when people can do something as obvious

967
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,399
as lift

968
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,039
somebody's you know watch our hat or

969
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,640
handbag out of their hands

970
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
without anyone noticing by just using

971
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,799
some simple social engineer techniques

972
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,520
such as um distraction and replacement

973
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
things like that

974
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
excellent we're on time so thank you

975
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
very much jenny for a great insight into

976
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,279
social engineering and some of your

977
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,120
thoughts thank you for being part of our

978
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,919
event

979
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:09,600
thank you very welcome
