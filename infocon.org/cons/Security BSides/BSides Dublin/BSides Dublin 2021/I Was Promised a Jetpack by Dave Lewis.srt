1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,320
thank you everyone for being here today

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,960
um this is uh really a treat for me to

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,559
be able to be here as part of eastside

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,240
dublin although i wish

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,759
very much that i could have been there

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,359
in person you know having a

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,199
pint of the black stuff with you but

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,720
unfortunately you know things being what

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,119
they are it has been an interesting

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,320
year to say the very least so i

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,599
am going to be talking today about trust

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,760
and a lot of this really centers around

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,200
the core of what we all do

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,680
as security practitioners now we've

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,600
talked a lot about uh things today that

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,960
we're talking about you know clicking on

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,719
emails or you know different types of

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,440
confidence

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,640
scams and things like that and it's been

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,520
amazing to see

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
what we have seen over the course of the

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,360
year where people have been

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
you know taking advantage of folks

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,960
because they are working remotely and

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,480
things of that effect

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,199
and we were promised you know a brighter

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,079
future

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,920
unfortunately we didn't get quite what

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,760
we were looking for but

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,440
i i think that we will definitely

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,040
improve over time

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
so see if i can get that going there

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,960
so speaking of time um yeah i got that

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
right finally uh this morning i tried to

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,159
join in to do

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
give my talk four hours early yeah

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,439
so when you have big bold print across

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,880
the top of webpage

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
even security practitioners do not

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
necessarily read what is

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,960
in bold i really do miss the blink tag

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,119
from days of old

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
so who am i um as you know anthony was

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,799
saying at the beginning

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
i do appreciate the intro typically now

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
i don't do intros because

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,079
it's more about talking about

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,439
information that we can share with each

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,520
other as opposed to who i am if you

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,000
really

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
are oh that's a little odd there we go

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,439
that's better

53
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,159
if you really want to talk more about uh

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,960
things that i do

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,640
uh there's my linkedin you can always

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
contact me and that information will be

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
available at the end of the talk

58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,280
as well so when we're looking back

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
uh this ugly little month was actually

60
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
the star of the show for

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,640
my keynote that i gave a besides dublin

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
three years ago

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
and what the whole idea there was we

64
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,960
were talking about you know the dog the

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
cat the bumper and the

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
the point here was security

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,080
practitioners are now getting to that

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
point where we are seen as one of the

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
adults at the table

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
and i think it is really incumbent upon

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,599
us to make sure that we don't mess it

72
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,319
up and i think we're doing a good job i

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,920
think we really have had

74
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,640
a strange opportunity in in light of the

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,440
pandemic

76
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
where we could be there as a voice of

77
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
reason for dealing with remote employees

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,200
and helping them understand how to

79
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,319
better secure

80
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,239
their environments as well as secure

81
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,440
themselves

82
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
and we have to make sure that we also

83
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,879
look at things like the human element

84
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,519
trust is not a permanent state and we

85
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,879
have to make sure that we are building

86
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,120
that trust with the end users

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,640
because we've got to take a moment to

88
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
realize that most of the people that are

89
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,599
working remotely

90
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,360
before the pandemic maybe they would

91
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
work the occasional friday and work the

92
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
occasional friday

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,760
and we have to realize that this is not

94
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
what most people are used to

95
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
even a year in we have to make sure that

96
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,599
as security practitioners we are further

97
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,440
building on that trust

98
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,519
so let's move on from there

99
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,959
now back in the 70s yes the gray is real

100
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,599
back in the 70s one of the things that i

101
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,519
was very very interested in

102
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,360
in the back of the comic books was there

103
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,239
was this ad for x-ray vision glasses

104
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,720
i absolutely had to have these glasses i

105
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
was like after my parents i said look

106
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,120
i really really need these how can i get

107
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
these i have the money i'll give you the

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,799
money how do i send it

109
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,799
they fought me at every turn at no point

110
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,040
did it occur to my young brain that

111
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
this was just a piece of cardboard and a

112
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,159
pair of lenses

113
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,159
but i needed to have this because i

114
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,239
trusted that it was an ad in the paper i

115
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,799
trusted that this was real but it turned

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
out not to be the case

117
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,720
thankfully i never did get these x-ray

118
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,879
specs but i do get to look back fondly

119
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,280
at the

120
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
silliness that was my point of view in

121
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,560
the world

122
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,879
a little later on i was into my early

123
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,840
teens

124
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,599
yeah i started reading comic books again

125
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,360
and in the back well there was the

126
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
switchblade comb

127
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,319
this time i actually did send money um i

128
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,040
think i was 11 at the time to be honest

129
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,320
sent cash in an envelope and i would

130
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
never dream of that these days but back

131
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,358
then didn't even occur to me that

132
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,560
somebody would have swiped the money but

133
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,358
they didn't

134
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,960
they sent me the product it was

135
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
switchblade comb as soon as you take it

136
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
you would click the button it would

137
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
swish open and i thought oh this is

138
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,800
awesome

139
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
the second time i did it the comb went

140
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
flying across the room and i was like

141
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
well that was three dollars well spent

142
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
i had believed that this was going to be

143
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,520
a solid product

144
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
didn't occur to me that three dollars

145
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,560
was not going to get me anything worth

146
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,280
anything

147
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
but that's just it we get this sense of

148
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
trust that we build up

149
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,520
whether it's real or not we have to make

150
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,320
sure that we are

151
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,720
understanding what is real from a trust

152
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
perspective

153
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
when we were kids we were promises were

154
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,360
made if you were reading popular science

155
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
or popular mechanics or anything like

156
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,240
that early on there was always talk

157
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,360
about you know personal

158
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,320
jet packs being able to fly everywhere

159
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,280
um

160
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
those were the days right but the thing

161
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,680
is we really took that to heart in a lot

162
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,479
of ways

163
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,479
and we have to make sure that we are not

164
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
getting lost in

165
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,840
the perception of what we think it

166
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
should be and look at the reality of

167
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,120
what we have to contend with

168
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
and as security practitioners we do have

169
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
a rather bad habit of

170
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,960
you know battling amongst ourselves and

171
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,840
i think that

172
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
this helps to erode the trust that we

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
are trying to build in the wider

174
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,639
audience

175
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,960
so anyone who's ever been on social

176
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,039
media understands the dumpster fire of

177
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,880
inhumanity that it can be at the best of

178
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,840
times

179
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,440
but there's also good to be pulled out

180
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
of as well of the interconnections with

181
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,000
each other

182
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,759
we have to make sure that we avoid

183
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
sliding down that slope

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
into negativity which is unfortunately

185
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,359
far too easy to do

186
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
we got to go beyond where we have been

187
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
to this point

188
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,520
so when i was in a role many years ago i

189
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,880
remember we found a security

190
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
vulnerability in our organization

191
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,039
that was going to stop a major product

192
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,240
release

193
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,199
i was like this is really really bad we

194
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,720
went in to talk to the cio

195
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,479
we figured out a solution before we got

196
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,000
to them and we said look

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you know everything's on fire this is

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,160
why and this is what we have to do

199
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
and he said okay i don't care if it's on

200
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
fire i don't care if there's a zero day

201
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
i want to know what the cost is the

202
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
organization what's the risk for the

203
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,479
organization

204
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,600
what is the expectation of loss i had to

205
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,440
go

206
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,639
i hadn't really thought about it in

207
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,720
those terms at that point i just knew

208
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
that this was really bad

209
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
and that things could go horribly

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,840
horribly awry so i had to reframe the

211
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,000
conversation

212
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,720
and in order to do so i had to work at

213
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,680
imparting to

214
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
the cio what it was that i was really

215
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,240
worried about and why this was a concern

216
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,919
and he gave me credit for coming in with

217
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,280
a solution but he had to have that

218
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,720
explained to him in a way that made

219
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
sense

220
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
because it was about reducing risk the

221
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,240
organization that would have

222
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,599
fundamentally been

223
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
a catastrophic failure but coming in

224
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
with my hair on fire saying

225
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,960
ah it's all bad wasn't going to get the

226
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,400
job done

227
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,680
so we got to look at the tools of the

228
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,319
trade that we have to contend with

229
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,360
we have always been very keen about

230
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
nmap and all the rest of it all these

231
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,560
different types of tools

232
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
writing powershell scripts whatever it

233
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
happens to be we all

234
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
have our tool sets to get the job done

235
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
one of the things that we tend to shy

236
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,720
away from collectively

237
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,199
is what is typically called soft skills

238
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,240
and

239
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,960
that's always sounds like it's you know

240
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,479
detracting from the term

241
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,800
it's not it's about understanding how to

242
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,080
deal with each other

243
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,680
how to deal with humans how to

244
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,160
communicate because

245
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,319
we need to build that trust and in order

246
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,080
to build the trust we have to use the

247
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
tools

248
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
that may not be a script may not be an

249
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,800
application

250
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
maybe just learning how to communicate

251
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,879
with each other

252
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,560
we also have to look at this in terms of

253
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
you know if there was a breach in your

254
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,360
organization

255
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
how are you going to communicate with

256
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,879
the wider audience who are you going to

257
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,560
talk to who are your stakeholders

258
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
how are you going to speak to those

259
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,599
stakeholders in terms that

260
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,680
they'll understand and they don't get

261
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,280
lost in the fear uncertainty and doubt

262
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,120
now when we look back and what i was

263
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
talking about a few moments ago about

264
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
you know buying things out of the back

265
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
of a comic book

266
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
that could have gone horribly wrong for

267
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,320
me insofar as i would have lost my money

268
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,679
and i would have been a rather dejected

269
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,958
11 year old

270
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,440
but today we see attackers that are

271
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,799
playing on this very much

272
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,640
on purpose we look at for example dark

273
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,200
patterns in user interfaces

274
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
when you have a user that is using a

275
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,920
tool you want to make sure that they are

276
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
able to use it

277
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,600
even if they're not technically a droid

278
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,959
if you're giving them a tool written by

279
00:08:58,959 --> 00:08:59,680
engineers for

280
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,920
engineers you're not necessarily going

281
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
to get the results you're looking for

282
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
and when you're looking at dark patterns

283
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,279
and user interface design you're also

284
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,080
looking at

285
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,959
you know the spec of dirt on the lens or

286
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,399
on the glass which it looks like but

287
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,200
it's actually

288
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
you know a flaw in the image that

289
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
somebody may inadvertently touch

290
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
and then suddenly they've clicked on

291
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,519
something they never had any intent to

292
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
do so

293
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,080
a great example of this was uh corey

294
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
doctorow posted a couple a few years

295
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
back now

296
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,560
if you'll notice in the circle on the uh

297
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
slide there's a little speck of dirt

298
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,279
there or

299
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
what appears to be so when people would

300
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,360
click it it would actually click the ad

301
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,279
and go to another resource that the user

302
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
never intended to do

303
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
this is why users have over time

304
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
built an innate distrust for many things

305
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,800
online

306
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
because attackers do play on this they

307
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,959
do find ways

308
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,200
to make it as difficult as possible for

309
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
people to trust

310
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
so we need to build that framework so

311
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,080
that they can better understand

312
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,839
how they can do things safely and

313
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,360
securely

314
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
so there's different types of excuse me

315
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,120
different types of dark patterns we look

316
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
at the bait and switch

317
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
uh conference shaming and things like

318
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
that trick questions

319
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
i've had exams with questions that were

320
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
innately wrong but they were trick

321
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,440
questions in order to get a response and

322
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
they wanted to see how we responded

323
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
didn't care for that much or the bait

324
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,480
and switch

325
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,399
you go to buy something on ebay and it's

326
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,839
like oh product a

327
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,839
and then the seller comes back oh

328
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,680
product a's actually sold out right now

329
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,959
but we'll give you product b

330
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,320
for the same price it's like these are

331
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,519
the reasons that people

332
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,279
lose their ability to trust

333
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
another techniques are you know in

334
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
intuitive ui abuse like the you know

335
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,079
hidden image

336
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,640
file that is on there or the x that

337
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
isn't an x if you go to click it it

338
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
actually activates an application as

339
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,399
opposed to closing the window

340
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,240
as security people we hope that we're

341
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,640
going to not make these mistakes

342
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
but we do make these mistakes look at me

343
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,320
i missed uh showed up

344
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,760
four hours too early for my talk um

345
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,040
i blame my pto but as we're going

346
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,160
through it we're looking at this this

347
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,880
sort of ui

348
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,399
abuse like different types of colors and

349
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,440
things like that that are used in

350
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
applications or web pages

351
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,399
is pervasive and i've had screenshots

352
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,240
that my 75 year old mother has sent me

353
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,880
where i

354
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
i would have got it wrong and she's

355
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,000
looking at and she's like there's

356
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,640
something

357
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,360
just wrong here which is speaks volumes

358
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
to the fact that she now listens to me

359
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,600
and it only took

360
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,920
you know quite a long time um but it's

361
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,040
really great that she

362
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
is now suspicious enough that she's like

363
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
questioning what is this and

364
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
how can i trust this particular website

365
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,320
the goal here is we want to make sure

366
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
that security decisions are

367
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,839
in their best interest and them being

368
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,079
the end users and ourselves as well

369
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,680
we don't want people to make security

370
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,000
decisions based on the fact that oh wait

371
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
i'll get a 200 gift 200

372
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,639
or 200 euro gift card from amazon yet

373
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,920
nobody's going to give you that that's

374
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,279
not going to happen you fill out a

375
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,200
survey they're not sending you that

376
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
they say oh you have a chance to win

377
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
that's different but if they say we'll

378
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,519
send it to you

379
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,800
that's where the red flag should be

380
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
going up

381
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
now malicious design is definitely a key

382
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,720
piece here um

383
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,240
you know and this is one of those things

384
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
where users are going to

385
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,240
not see it like what the screenshots

386
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,519
that my mother was telling me where i

387
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,880
would look at it and i'm like this is

388
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,200
entirely intuitively wrong

389
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
but only a designer could see that you

390
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
want to make sure that

391
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720
this isn't something that is a pervasive

392
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
issue we have to find ways

393
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,160
to better communicate to the end users

394
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,760
and provide them tools to keep them safe

395
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,279
and secure as well

396
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
we need to make it harder for the

397
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,160
attackers to do their job

398
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
because fundamentally we can't trust

399
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
ourselves

400
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,120
how does that might sound we have to

401
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
find out a way to structure this

402
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
so that we are saving ourselves from

403
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
ourselves

404
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,880
because we do make bad choices

405
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
let's think let that sink in for a

406
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
second

407
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,600
because we have our bias whatever that

408
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,560
might be

409
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,079
we'll say oh no i'm not biased

410
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,240
everybody's biased it it's just that is

411
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,680
their view of the world

412
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,000
that is their particular bias that may

413
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
skew data in

414
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
in a survey that may skew data in a

415
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,519
focus group that's not necessarily a bad

416
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,000
thing

417
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,040
but you have to be aware that it exists

418
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
and the same thing can be had when

419
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,079
you're talking about artificial

420
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,760
intelligence's example

421
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,680
you'll have biases that are built into

422
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
it using algorithms

423
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,880
because the algorithms are written by

424
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
humans

425
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
so we've seen examples where bad things

426
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
can happen

427
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,639
amit elizari excuse me elizari

428
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,720
she came up with a proposal of a bug

429
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,120
bounty for bad algorithms

430
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,880
and you know what i absolutely agree

431
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,079
with this this is an absolutely

432
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,440
fantastic idea

433
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,600
because we have seen applications that

434
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
would mischaracterize people

435
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,040
based on facial scans or whatever it

436
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
happened to be of their images

437
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,839
and they would get them categorically

438
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,160
wrong was this malicious

439
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,000
to be determined but in a lot of cases

440
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,279
is mainly just

441
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,440
people didn't do it right they didn't

442
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
write the algorithms correctly

443
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,279
and these are the kind of things that

444
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,880
really really resonate with me

445
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,560
those things that we have to address to

446
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
help improve the trust factor with the

447
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,560
end users

448
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
because otherwise we end up with instead

449
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
of capabilities and incapability of

450
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,040
the inability to get things done in a

451
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
safe and secure manner

452
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,959
and to further improve things on a

453
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,079
global scale

454
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,240
and when i say that look at the pandemic

455
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,920
we are dealing with right now

456
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,240
we're a year in and by and large

457
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
we're still muttering along can you

458
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,880
imagine if this had taken place

459
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,839
in 2003

460
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,120
would we have been able to get things

461
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,680
done sure but nothing to the scale and

462
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
efficiency that we have now

463
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
um and that's one of those things that

464
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,279
we have to be sure

465
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,440
that we realize that how far we have

466
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
come in a short period of time

467
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,279
because sarge back in 2003 i had to

468
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,399
contend with it when i was dealing with

469
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,519
the power company

470
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
not that i got it that we had to prepare

471
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,959
the company for it and when we were

472
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,079
going through and looking at all the

473
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,440
documentation looking at everything we

474
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
realized that

475
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,440
how flat-footed we had been caught out

476
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
and how horrible things had gone if in

477
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,040
fact it was something akin to what we're

478
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
dealing with today with covet

479
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,360
you look at the business continuity and

480
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,600
the dr documents and things like that

481
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,120
and the vast majority of them say oh you

482
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,720
know just pop around to the shop and get

483
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
x number of laptops in the event that

484
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,600
our building is hit by a

485
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,560
meteor that doesn't scale

486
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
and security geek experts we make

487
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,920
mistakes we all do um

488
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,600
everybody makes mistakes and this is a

489
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,040
great example here this is an article

490
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
written by david spark where

491
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
a former security person became a

492
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
developer and started his own company

493
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,959
and made a lot of basic security

494
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,399
mistakes

495
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,000
i won't name who this is is not the

496
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
point of this but that's just to show

497
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,079
that

498
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,720
we're human and we have to be aware of

499
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,199
this

500
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,720
and we have to build frameworks that are

501
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
going to further improve things overall

502
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,759
now another example of how things can be

503
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,399
messed with is corrupting data we always

504
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,920
talk about websites being breached and

505
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,240
dead

506
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,759
and mainly stolen but what if a website

507
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
was breached and somebody just altered a

508
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,959
little bit

509
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,560
a financial institution here in canada

510
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
quite a few years ago now they promoted

511
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
new code into production

512
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
everything worked and test but when they

513
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
promoted it to production

514
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
it failed and it catastrophically failed

515
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
and they were out for six days

516
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
because there was one semicolon in the

517
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
wrong place

518
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,639
took down the whole website these are

519
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,000
the kind of things that we don't often

520
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,519
take into account we have to make sure

521
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,120
we have a good way to address these sort

522
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,000
of things

523
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
an example here with david sutter this

524
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
was an example where

525
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
there was a data leak of emails and it

526
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,240
was made to look like he was actually

527
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
working with the cia

528
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,399
and again this wasn't actually the case

529
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,480
this was somebody had changed the data

530
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,720
and this is this subtle you know changes

531
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
in data in order to

532
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,240
change the narrative is another problem

533
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
that we have to contend with as well

534
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
and here's another example here with a

535
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,919
changes to a document as well

536
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
that changed these texts well the the

537
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
look

538
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,199
you ever have that moment where you trip

539
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
on your tongue yeah this is it um

540
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,119
that changed the meaning of the

541
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,679
information that was released

542
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
and this is really about denial of trust

543
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
and we have to figure out ways to defend

544
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,840
against denial of trust

545
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,919
because if the users don't believe what

546
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,760
they're seeing and if they don't believe

547
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
how can we get them to do things in a

548
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
safe and secure manner if they are just

549
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,919
of a mind that everything is wrong and

550
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,840
everything is horribly broken

551
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
if we're able to trust ourselves and

552
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,039
then we earn that trust from

553
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
others that is a way to build things

554
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
going forward but as we've seen with

555
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,280
you know ordering out of comic books of

556
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
dark patterns things like that

557
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
we fundamentally can't trust ourselves

558
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,440
so we have to find ways to help

559
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,480
ourselves to trust

560
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,240
ourselves and that sounds a little bit

561
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,720
odd but bear with me

562
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
so how do we earn that trust well we do

563
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,080
it with honesty

564
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,280
transparency predictability capability

565
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
willingness to correct mistakes like

566
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
showing up four hours early and falling

567
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,600
on your sword for it

568
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,799
and accountability these are things that

569
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,400
we can fundamentally take into

570
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,120
our everyday lives to improve things

571
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,960
when you have something like a community

572
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
like besides dublin

573
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
you have the ability to come together as

574
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
a group as a family

575
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
and share how we can improve things

576
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,039
going forward

577
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,120
remember when microsoft came out with

578
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,039
the trustworthy computing

579
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,600
that really did change things for them

580
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,320
it was a

581
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,679
you know stake in the ground they said

582
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,200
this is what we have to do to improve

583
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
things going forward

584
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,440
and it worked microsoft has done a very

585
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,080
good job

586
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,600
on security in the intervening years and

587
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
this is just an example of many where we

588
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
can show how we can improve things

589
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,320
overall for the wider audience

590
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
so people like to say horrible things

591
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
about zero trust

592
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,039
i've heard them all but

593
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,960
the core fundamentals behind zero trust

594
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
are ones that actually make sense

595
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,360
it's built on actual

596
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,240
actionable info you know network zone

597
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,919
segmentation users

598
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,000
device management all of these different

599
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,039
types of things

600
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,280
to help layer security controls into

601
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,039
your organization

602
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,679
and zero trust while it was a buzzword

603
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,360
that came out in 2010

604
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,400
ish it really has served his purpose it

605
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,039
got people to pay attention

606
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,160
so how do we move on from that well

607
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,280
we have to say yes that was a good

608
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,880
starting point but we got to build on

609
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,919
that

610
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,760
so i gave a talk in singapore a couple

611
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
years ago where i got up on stage and i

612
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,360
talked about zero trust and half the

613
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,720
audience had no idea what i was talking

614
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,600
about

615
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,159
and that really surprised me because i

616
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,159
naively thought because i had my bias

617
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,679
that everybody was talking about zero

618
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,880
trust in some form of another

619
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
i was wrong and when i had that

620
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,240
conversation after i got off the stage

621
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,200
with a few people

622
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,280
they actually found it very negative to

623
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
call a zero trust

624
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
i took their point it does have a bit of

625
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,720
a negative connotation

626
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,400
so if you can take the same thing and

627
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,679
then call it something like continuous

628
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,880
trusted access

629
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,799
then it actually seems a little bit more

630
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,640
fluid a little bit more sensible

631
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,320
for people going forward in the long

632
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,679
term

633
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,720
now when we are born we default to trust

634
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,640
this is what we have to do in order to

635
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,919
survive as an

636
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,360
infant we're looking for food we're

637
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,840
looking for shelter we need to do this

638
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,720
we need to trust folks but in the

639
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,120
world of the internet we really have to

640
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,440
take our time to make sure

641
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
that is trust but verified and verified

642
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,880
again

643
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,960
there's a great book by malcolm gladwell

644
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
called talking to strangers

645
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,559
he really delves into the communication

646
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,880
breakdowns that happen between

647
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,679
individual groups individual people and

648
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,919
how you can better bridge that gap

649
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,320
so we as security practitioners while we

650
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,760
were having the rallying cry a couple

651
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,679
years ago of being the adult in the room

652
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,960
now we have to be the great

653
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,159
communicators

654
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,480
we have to find the way to have the

655
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
conversation

656
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,600
with the wider audience we got to get

657
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
away from naval gazing because

658
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,640
when we're talking amongst ourselves

659
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,159
that's all well and good

660
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,840
but if we're not communicating to the

661
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,280
wider audience

662
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,360
one we're losing that ability to build

663
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,200
the trust with the wider audience

664
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,760
and and you know establish ourselves and

665
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
our bona fides

666
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,039
i always have to work in my coffee

667
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,280
bricks

668
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,580
thank you for smiling anthony i saw that

669
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,400
[Music]

670
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
so we want to make sure that we're not

671
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
trusting something simply because it's

672
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
inside the firewall

673
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
this actually happened to me at a

674
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
company i worked at quite a few years

675
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,960
ago

676
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,880
quite a few years ago actually we had a

677
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
vulnerability test that was done for the

678
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
external um and the attacker said you

679
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
know here's all the

680
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,159
the official attackers said here's all

681
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,600
the things that we have to contend with

682
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,679
all the things that we have to fix

683
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,440
and the inside of the network was a flat

684
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
network and you could basically go

685
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
anywhere

686
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
the cio said that didn't really matter

687
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,799
he said fundamentally we trust everyone

688
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,200
who works here

689
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,559
in hindsight i know there was at least

690
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,679
two people there that we shouldn't have

691
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,200
been trusting out right but i won't go

692
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,039
any further down that road but

693
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,720
this is one of those things that just

694
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,320
because you are you know

695
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
part of the same organization you have

696
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
to make sure that you're taking steps

697
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
to secure that organization sure you may

698
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
trust them you may go out for a pint

699
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,760
with them afterwards

700
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,280
after work but

701
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
whoops has happened and it might not

702
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,799
ever be any sense of malice that

703
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,360
something

704
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
goes awry but we have to make sure that

705
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,360
we are putting a framework in place to

706
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
avoid those sort of issues

707
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,960
you know passwords i love to beat up on

708
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
passwords it's the same thing as if you

709
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,159
put your house key under your door map

710
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,440
when you go to work

711
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,559
knowing that your kids are going to get

712
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,520
home early so they can get in the house

713
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,200
but the attackers know this too

714
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,280
so just because you know that your child

715
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,720
is going to use that key doesn't mean

716
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,000
the attacker isn't the one coming

717
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
through the front door

718
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
to you know rob your robbie and take

719
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,320
yourself

720
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,440
these are the kind of things we have to

721
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
make sure that we're doing a better way

722
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,960
to improve authentications

723
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,120
trust is about granting access without

724
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,640
verifying we're born

725
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
we're looking for food we're crying we

726
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,840
just accept that our parents are our

727
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,400
parents

728
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,159
but trust about granting access because

729
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,159
you're verified is an improvement beyond

730
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:40,799
that

731
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,279
so as we grow older we learn more we

732
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,120
become hopefully wiser

733
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,360
i'm still working on that but these are

734
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,600
the kind of things we need to address

735
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,200
because the erosion of trust is all

736
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
around us we have psychological

737
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
operations units that are going online

738
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,080
all the time there was one that

739
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,039
absolutely

740
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,200
floored me just 48 hours ago i was

741
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,240
reading about it

742
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
where this person was saying that their

743
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,640
relative had gotten the vaccine

744
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
had gone blind but the date that they

745
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,240
said they had received the vaccine was

746
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,320
at least a month before any vaccine was

747
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,919
even available

748
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,279
also as one of those twitter accounts

749
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,559
with all the numbers at the end so it's

750
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,000
like high probability of being a fake

751
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,520
one to start with

752
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,840
then we have to look at data misuse you

753
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
know

754
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,480
there are so many organizations out

755
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,600
there that are always constantly

756
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
harvesting information

757
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,279
how are they protecting that information

758
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,640
and we've seen talks today where people

759
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
are talking about homomorphic encryption

760
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
and different types of ways to breach

761
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,960
different web applications

762
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,559
and we have to make sure that we are

763
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,320
constantly iterating through

764
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,679
to improve the security of the

765
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
organization because

766
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,120
this amount of data that we're

767
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,679
collecting is of value not only to the

768
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,720
organization

769
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
but to the criminal element as well if

770
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,960
they're able to get their hands on this

771
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,320
virtually um this information could

772
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,320
be a huge boon for them financially

773
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,600
and then there's the ever-present data

774
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
breach data breaches

775
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,120
we've been dealing with them forever i

776
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,799
mean back in 2012 i started tracking

777
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,640
them on myself on the back of the napkin

778
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,600
because

779
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,360
i found it really odd how many they were

780
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,640
ticking upwards

781
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,240
and now if you go to sites like i've

782
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,279
talked about this in the past

783
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,799
information is beautiful.net

784
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,559
if you look at their site it's

785
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,400
absolutely stunning they have a visual

786
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,919
representation of data breaches there

787
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,640
which is

788
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,440
really something to see we can do better

789
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,720
than this

790
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
so how has trust become an attack system

791
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
we look at integrity attacks you know

792
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
subtle avert corruptions of data

793
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,320
so you're changing that one character in

794
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,600
the data to take down an entire website

795
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
and then accusing somebody of a data

796
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
breach how often have we seen certain

797
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,200
people in the industry say oh

798
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
does anybody know somebody at this

799
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,320
particular company i have a question

800
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,000
usually everybody goes nuts it's a data

801
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,679
breach it has to be they wouldn't ask

802
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,799
otherwise

803
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,159
meanwhile it's just like no i got my

804
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,760
card stuck in an atm and i just want to

805
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,840
know how to get it out

806
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,520
we have to make sure that we take a step

807
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,679
back any time we see any sort of issue

808
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,799
and say okay what is occam's razor as

809
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,000
applied to this

810
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
and what is making the most sense i've

811
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,400
seen entire websites go down

812
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,559
where people are like it's a breach and

813
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,840
they're screaming at their top of their

814
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,200
lungs i'm like

815
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
having worked in organizations where i

816
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,200
had to maintain

817
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,440
uh websites for large corporations for

818
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,279
better part of 20 years

819
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,799
i know more often than not it's like

820
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,320
something just went wrong

821
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,159
a system failed whatever it happens to

822
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,080
be it didn't fail over cleanly

823
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,440
we got to make sure that we're not just

824
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,880
running around with our hair on fire

825
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,559
if we want to look at how to improve

826
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,600
things we got to look at some of the

827
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,640
core tenants

828
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,799
we have to look at you know yet another

829
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,760
triad

830
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,600
we always heard you know confidentiality

831
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,279
integrity and availability sure that was

832
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,880
a great back of the napkin last minute

833
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,159
addition to a deck

834
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,880
that we're still dealing with today but

835
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,000
a simple way to look at

836
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,440
when you're protecting an organization

837
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,880
is about you know how do you protect the

838
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,679
users

839
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,039
how do you protect the devices that are

840
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,400
attached to your network and how do you

841
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,080
protect the applications that you need

842
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,880
to protect your organization

843
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,559
zero trust or continuous trusted access

844
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,720
is a really good way to look at this

845
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,880
when we look at our ecosystem everything

846
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,480
we have to deal with

847
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,320
it's actually stunning how many holes

848
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,400
there are in the perimeter that we once

849
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,200
knew

850
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,919
so the perimeter as we knew it in the

851
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,480
past

852
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,200
is gone let's be completely honest with

853
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,240
ourselves

854
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,640
um being an archaeology student believe

855
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
it or not uh before i ever got into

856
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,120
computers

857
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,559
you know there was a story that i always

858
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,880
loved to tell where the visigoth sacked

859
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,159
the city of rome

860
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,760
and they did it by surrounding the city

861
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,039
and waiting until they ran out of

862
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,880
supplies they didn't fire a shot

863
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,720
not a single arrow not a single rock

864
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,399
they just waited

865
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,159
it worked the romans ran out of food

866
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,000
they opened the doors the visigoths took

867
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,679
the city

868
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,200
nowadays we've you know bearing in mind

869
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,520
that

870
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,159
was two thousand years ago give or take

871
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:54,720
um

872
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,200
we have shown that that traditional

873
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,240
perimeter approach

874
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,960
is a broken methodology we have to look

875
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
at things about you know

876
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,240
where is an access decision being made

877
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,440
as

878
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,320
the perimeter now

879
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,840
zero trust love it or love it or hate it

880
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,640
that term

881
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,159
has some merit um more so the

882
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,799
meat behind it as opposed to the name we

883
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,080
have to make sure we're getting back to

884
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,600
the core fundamentals

885
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
all of the things that we should have

886
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,360
been doing for the last 30 years

887
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,440
network zone segmentation and what have

888
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,200
you look at this we're here we go

889
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,320
through the steps here

890
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,480
establishing trust in your users are the

891
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,760
users in your environment the ones that

892
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,440
are supposed to be there

893
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,520
or are you running based on passwords

894
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,200
and somebody left a sticky note in an

895
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,320
airport lounge

896
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,320
which i found more than a few times

897
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,799
and then gaining access to resources if

898
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,640
i was someone of a negative ben

899
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
there are many different companies i

900
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,399
could have had access to

901
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,000
there there was a company in the past

902
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
where i was able to get access to all of

903
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
their software repository

904
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,760
because they had a username of admin and

905
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,520
a password of license one two three

906
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,559
that just breaks my heart so once you

907
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,640
have the trust in the user identity you

908
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,760
wanna make sure that you're looking at

909
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,039
the devices that are attaching to your

910
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,279
network is there some canadian coming in

911
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,880
with an xbox first generation

912
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,240
using that for ssl or is it a corporate

913
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,120
owned asset that's supposed to be

914
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,399
attaching to the network i may or may

915
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,520
not have done that

916
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,039
you want to ensure the trustworthiness

917
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,000
of the devices you want to make sure

918
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,360
they're patched to current or n

919
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,919
minus one and then have policies that

920
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,880
you can apply

921
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,559
if you have somebody in finance that is

922
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,960
suddenly showing up in toronto canada

923
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,320
and all of your operations are in

924
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,399
ireland you may want to have a question

925
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,159
you may want to say okay wait why is

926
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,320
this happening

927
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
as you go through this as you iterate

928
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,080
through you get closer and closer

929
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,000
to continuous trusted access type of

930
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,520
mindset framework whatever you want to

931
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,320
call it

932
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,120
it's all about reducing risk it's not

933
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,960
about some sort of flashy logo or

934
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
sticker or nice t-shirt

935
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,799
you want to make sure you're reducing

936
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,559
the risk in your organization because we

937
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,399
all have a fiduciary responsibility to

938
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,200
protect

939
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,840
our organizations to protect our assets

940
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
to protect the people that we

941
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,840
are there to champion

942
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,240
you want to go through and verify the

943
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,559
users verify their devices

944
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,720
and verify the applications because the

945
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,240
applications are really

946
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,399
key especially now that we have pivoted

947
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,080
to basically a remote workforce for the

948
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,520
better part of the last year

949
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,039
around the world so

950
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,640
they're getting their email from sas

951
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
based implementations there are

952
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,559
things like salesforce whatever you have

953
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,480
all web delivered

954
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,320
if you are not marshalling controlled of

955
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,559
access for that

956
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,000
you are really opening yourselves up to

957
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
potential problems so if you have you

958
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,520
know dave sitting at a tim hortons in

959
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,360
toronto canada accessing

960
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,559
your servers in dublin because i could

961
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,080
get direct access to it and i found the

962
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,440
username password

963
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
this is a problem so we have to look at

964
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,279
reducing that risk and doing a better

965
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,440
job of that

966
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,840
because the attackers will love to well

967
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,760
that slide blew up

968
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,159
so the attackers are going to try in any

969
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,679
way they can to get in because they're

970
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,760
it's about financial gain at this point

971
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,960
um back in the days of zone h and all

972
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,760
those other

973
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,159
aldos and all the rest of those uh web

974
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,440
boards would said

975
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
um you know greets to my friends i hack

976
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,039
your website hahaha and you have all the

977
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,399
screenshots of that

978
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,039
that has evolved into big business and

979
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,000
we're talking

980
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,480
millions of dollars so why make it

981
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,000
easier for them

982
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
if you have the ability to if they have

983
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,360
the ability rather to get a username and

984
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,320
password

985
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,679
that's part of their job done if you can

986
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,880
do something like multi-factor

987
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,480
authentication biometrics

988
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,640
anything like that anything that makes

989
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
it more difficult for the end user

990
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,600
that's great

991
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,360
there's an open standard i'll say that

992
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,880
again an open standard

993
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,679
by the w3c called web authent or about

994
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,960
web authent rather

995
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,480
if you take nothing else away from today

996
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
that's actually an excellent piece of

997
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
documentation to read because it's an

998
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,159
open standard and it is a way to move

999
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,120
forward to

1000
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,240
what is extensively called a

1001
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,880
passwordless feature a way to

1002
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,600
do authentications that will obviate the

1003
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,120
need for passwords

1004
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,799
so there's your homework assignment i'll

1005
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,440
just keep going from there

1006
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,480
and you want to make sure that the

1007
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,080
devices that are attaching your network

1008
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,480
have

1009
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
good hygiene because you don't want to

1010
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,480
introduce problems that don't have to be

1011
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:18,960
there

1012
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
and with this remote workforce that we

1013
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,840
have to contend with on a continuous

1014
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,399
basis

1015
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,519
we want to make sure they're not

1016
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,840
inadvertently introducing problems that

1017
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,279
because they were not connecting their

1018
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,039
laptop for long periods of time

1019
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,880
that they suddenly had a you know

1020
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,480
library that didn't get updated

1021
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,919
attacker was able to breach them with an

1022
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,000
email you want to make sure that you are

1023
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,919
not making that easier for the attacker

1024
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,000
because if you take every portion of the

1025
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,080
business and drop them into buckets

1026
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,600
you have the workplace the workforce and

1027
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,320
the workload three core components

1028
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,880
of your organization fundamentally you

1029
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,320
can put everything in

1030
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,880
the people the devices the applications

1031
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,240
and we want to make sure that we are

1032
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
approaching this in a way that we're

1033
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
going to put our arms around it to

1034
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,320
better secure our environments

1035
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,519
we have to make sure that we're dealing

1036
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,760
with user trust you don't

1037
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,840
like i i tell this over and over again

1038
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,480
but this one organization i worked at

1039
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,159
we did a quick assessment of well not

1040
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,600
quick assessment an assessment

1041
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,559
of all the user accounts in our

1042
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,120
organization and the reason i tell this

1043
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,640
every time is because this is just

1044
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
absolutely gobsmacking to me

1045
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,519
we had 10 users with super user status

1046
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,000
one was

1047
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
deceased had been deceased for five

1048
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,279
years but their account had been used in

1049
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,640
the last two

1050
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,159
none of those 10 people were still with

1051
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,000
the organization

1052
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,760
i apologize to people who have seen me

1053
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,200
talk about that over and over again but

1054
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,559
this is just one of those things i used

1055
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,880
to hit the point home

1056
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,399
then you want to do discovery you want

1057
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,159
to go through your network go through

1058
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,519
your organization

1059
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,440
and look at what you have connected to

1060
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,000
the wire because i guarantee you it's

1061
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,360
not what you think it is

1062
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
i know because when i had to do a roll

1063
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,640
out of a

1064
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,760
particular antivirus client i found

1065
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,600
there was at least double the number of

1066
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,120
nodes on the network

1067
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,559
than our inventory thought there was

1068
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,559
you want to have the ability to trust

1069
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,480
the nodes that are in your organization

1070
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,639
it be the remote or in a building one

1071
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,079
day hopefully

1072
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,159
you want to be able to be assured what

1073
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,280
it is that's attached to your

1074
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,399
organization

1075
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,839
and if you have an untrusted device that

1076
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,679
suddenly shows up on the network

1077
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
you want to be able to be aware of it

1078
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,719
and be able to

1079
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,760
address it as well how

1080
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,440
trustworthy are those devices that are

1081
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,960
attached to your network

1082
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,239
have you gone through and looked you

1083
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,159
know is dave coming in on that xbox

1084
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,960
again

1085
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
yes i did do that in one organization

1086
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,480
and yes they did try to get me fired for

1087
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,079
that but i was showed them i was doing

1088
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,199
security testing because i was a

1089
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,480
security guy

1090
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,520
anyway suffice to say nobody knew until

1091
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,879
i told them

1092
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,639
and i guarantee that sort of behavior

1093
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,239
happens all over the place and this

1094
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,599
wasn't a case of me trying to be

1095
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,480
malicious

1096
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,839
it was a case of i was like oh wait

1097
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,760
there's a web browser in here will this

1098
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,800
work

1099
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,560
and by and large a lot of the whoops

1100
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,239
factors happen because of stuff like

1101
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,479
that

1102
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,400
and then there's security debt everybody

1103
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
and every organization who's ever worked

1104
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,200
has at least

1105
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,240
seen one of these the beige desktop

1106
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,480
on or under a desk that is running a

1107
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,839
mission critical application

1108
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,920
written by a summer student that nobody

1109
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,440
knows how to port it off of there but

1110
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,240
they can't let it go down

1111
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
this is a problem and i use this as an

1112
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,079
example because this happens in

1113
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,079
organizations over and over again

1114
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,520
we have to make sure we're building

1115
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
trust in the users but we also have to

1116
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,960
give them the tools in order to

1117
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,400
establish that trust

1118
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,839
so if you're running on deprecated

1119
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,440
hardware deprecated software

1120
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,680
you are really setting yourself up for a

1121
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,440
possible cascade failure

1122
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,760
as we've seen with multiple types of

1123
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,839
supply chain issues over the last few

1124
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,160
months

1125
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
you want to be able to enforce adaptive

1126
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,920
policies in your organizations

1127
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
so that you know somebody in finance is

1128
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,040
not suddenly doing maintenance work on a

1129
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,079
back-end system or

1130
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,400
doing changes on a router i actually

1131
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,079
have been an organization where we did

1132
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,280
have a cfo

1133
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,119
making router changes because he got

1134
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,200
tired of waiting for a change request

1135
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
yeah that went well

1136
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,599
and the types of policies that you want

1137
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,520
to look at you want to like what makes

1138
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,680
sense for your organization

1139
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,280
don't let any vendor come in say you

1140
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,119
have to have this with the blinky lights

1141
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,880
no what's your list of requirements what

1142
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,560
are you trying to save

1143
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,839
in your environment what are you trying

1144
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,680
to protect so

1145
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,839
if you have the ability to spec spell

1146
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:22,800
that out

1147
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,960
before you talk to any vendor that's a

1148
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,160
huge win

1149
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,760
i've had vendors in the past that came

1150
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,359
in to see me when i was on the other

1151
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,480
side of the phone

1152
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
and they said oh yeah our particular

1153
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,599
software will protect

1154
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,040
your applications and i was working for

1155
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,280
a power company and i said okay well

1156
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,400
we're running systems that are

1157
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,440
264 the you know unix variant

1158
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,200
and this is will it work on there i was

1159
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,839
like oh yeah it'll work on true 64 232

1160
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,599
no problem no such thing

1161
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,200
so this is one of the things that's why

1162
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,960
you have to have a clear defined list of

1163
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
requirements because sometimes people

1164
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,839
will sell you anything just to get into

1165
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,800
the door

1166
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,240
so we have to make sure that we are

1167
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
pushing back and having a larger

1168
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,599
conversation with folks

1169
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,400
because it's incumbent upon us to raise

1170
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,440
all boats

1171
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,560
and if somebody out there is doing

1172
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,920
something silly we need to call them on

1173
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,520
it and i mean that gently

1174
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,800
because we can improve

1175
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,839
and we have to make sure that we're

1176
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,440
protecting every application out there

1177
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,800
that we need to access

1178
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,880
because we need to keep the lights on

1179
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,720
now back in you know february march time

1180
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,079
frame when all of this started going

1181
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,400
sideways we realized very quickly that

1182
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,839
you know there were times where we had

1183
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,160
to make

1184
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,680
judgment calls we had to make sure that

1185
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
we were looking

1186
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,280
at how we're going to improve things for

1187
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,079
the organization

1188
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,760
by accepting risks that we would not

1189
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,359
have otherwise accepted because we had

1190
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,480
to keep the business going

1191
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,000
sorry a little thing blink on my screen

1192
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,760
there so

1193
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,320
we want to oops we want to make sure

1194
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,040
that we are

1195
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,640
protecting all of those applications

1196
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,000
keep the lights on but when we make

1197
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,560
those

1198
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,720
risk-based decisions and we accept those

1199
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,960
risks that we go back and revisit them

1200
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,520
because otherwise they too will help add

1201
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,880
in to the security debt that we can

1202
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,280
accumulate over time

1203
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,280
we need to make our own jet packs

1204
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
that might sound trite but we were

1205
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,359
promised so rather than waiting around

1206
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,200
for somebody to deliver it to us

1207
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,680
we need to do a better job collectively

1208
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,839
and i see that security practitioners we

1209
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,200
have become

1210
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
you know the voice of reason in many

1211
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,119
organizations and i think that this is

1212
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,520
only going to continue as long as we

1213
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,400
realize

1214
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,800
that we need to be the adults we need to

1215
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,880
have the conversation about risk

1216
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,280
we need to conf you know conv have the

1217
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,040
conversation in the lingua franca

1218
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,320
that the people we're talking to

1219
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,800
understand

1220
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,119
trust is neither binary or permanent we

1221
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,800
have to make sure that we are constantly

1222
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,520
working

1223
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,560
to maintain that

1224
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,760
what happens in a community without

1225
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,599
trust

1226
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,079
what happens in a society without trust

1227
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,000
everything falls apart

1228
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,079
we can't afford that we need to be

1229
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,040
staying sticking together

1230
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,640
seems like double the slide we have to

1231
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,079
go through and reinforce that trust with

1232
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,920
prevention detection and correction

1233
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,119
these are the things that we need to

1234
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,160
make sure that we're constantly

1235
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,119
iterating through

1236
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,640
because when you're looking at a

1237
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
continuous trusted access or

1238
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,599
zero trust or however it makes most

1239
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,599
sense to you we have to be constantly

1240
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,640
iterating through

1241
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,240
there's no end state that you're going

1242
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,839
to get to where you're going to be

1243
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,440
zero trust certified that flat out

1244
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,880
doesn't exist

1245
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
but it is a way to reduce risk in the

1246
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,320
organization and improve things over the

1247
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,160
long term

1248
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,560
continuous trust access data validation

1249
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,079
transparency accountability these are

1250
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,359
all good things

1251
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,480
pineapple on a pizza not so much yes we

1252
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,079
invented that in canada yes we're still

1253
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,000
sorry

1254
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
trustworthy data and systems can't be

1255
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,680
separated from you know trustworthy

1256
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,240
people

1257
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,240
we have to make sure that we are working

1258
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,599
on how we can best

1259
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,160
validate all of this because let's be

1260
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,880
honest

1261
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,240
mistakes are going to happen

1262
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
i know cheap shot couldn't take couldn't

1263
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,680
resist but

1264
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,118
it is kind of an evergreen statement

1265
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,200
we can all look towards a brighter

1266
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,040
future as we're going forward and i

1267

pandora's box now because once these

for for the general public there's going

1283
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,960
to be a brand new

1284
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,560
type of business going on where they're

1285
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,079
going to be offering zero trust

1286
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,240
certification the company so

1287
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,440
thanks if they do that i will have a

1288
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,119

that's brilliant i'll give people a

1290
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,640
minute

1291
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,839
just to see if there's any questions

1292
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,760
there's nothing in so far no worries

1293
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,319
they can always drop me a line

1294
