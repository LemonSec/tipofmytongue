1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,640
i'm

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,639
actually quite excited about the

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,559
opportunity to uh

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,320
to present to everyone today here this

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,559
is my eighth b sides and i've had a

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,320
a pretty good run in in this part of the

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,160
world i was fortunate enough to uh

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,000
keynote besides comrade and

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
tonight 2019 when they started their

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,000
b-sides up and spoke at b-sides london

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,880
so i'm

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,279
i'm disappointed that i'm not able to uh

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,400
be in dublin with

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
with everyone because i love visiting

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,920
your city but i'm grateful for the

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,520
opportunity to share

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
my knowledge with you uh anyway that i

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
have the opportunity so

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,480
i'm briefly just going to give you a

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,239
little bit of background on uh

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,440
some of the things i do to kind of give

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,640
you the perspective of where this

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,079
information is coming from

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,120
and then i'm hoping uh that this will

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
help you to understand a little bit more

26
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,399
of the the

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,760
particulars of what some of the threat

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,480
actors are doing with different um

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
the different kinds of threat actors

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
that we see attacking

31
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,120
organizations these days and to help you

32
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,719
allocate your time and money in the

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,159
right places in order to best defend

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,879
against

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,040
those attackers and so this is sort of

36
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
my my brief action plan

37
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,479
and my role at sophos is uh interesting

38
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,000
now because of course we have

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
managed threat response uh and rapid

40
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,840
response services for

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
people both in the monitoring capacity

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,520
but also from a

43
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,799
response when they're getting hit with

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,320
ransomware attacks and things so it's

45
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
allowed me to kind of gather a lot of

46
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,799
information

47
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,159
in a more i hate to use the word

48
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,680
holistic because it makes like makes it

49
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
sound like it's um

50
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,079
a bit not real but you know previous to

51
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,560
this

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000
our perspective was purely from the

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
point of detection and going through

54
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
lots and lots of malware samples doing

55
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,479
our very best to make sure that those

56
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,280
malware

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
did not impact people's systems now we

58
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
can kind of see the whole attack chain

59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
and how different tools are being

60
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
detected at different stages

61
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,479
and what method methodologies victims

62
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,960
or or defenders uh are employing in

63
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,560
order to stop different stages of those

64
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,280
attacks

65
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,479
and kind of seeing where people are

66
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
having success and failure in

67
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
defending against those attacks and so

68
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,680
we've kind of got more pieces of the

69
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,960
puzzle now right because we can do

70
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,040
in-depth analysis of the malware itself

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
and so this information is what i've

72
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,080
used to kind of feed into

73
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
today's presentation to share with you

74
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
kind of our current view

75
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,160
uh of what's happening in that threat

76
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
landscape

77
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
and uh we'll start with i think it's

78
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,280
important to know who

79
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,760
and and each of you will have to put

80
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
yourself

81
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,640
in some perspective is to understand

82
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
whether specific threat actors may be a

83
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
risk to your organization or not

84
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,120
but i think for the majority of us uh

85
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,480
all of them will

86
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,680
uh if we put them in high level buckets

87
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,319
i kind of

88
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,560
have things in in three categories now i

89
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,760
have sort of the

90
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
the professional attacker who works in

91
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
the nation state

92
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,160
and you'll probably fall within one of

93
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,560
two

94
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,000
categories when it comes to nation

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
states no matter who you are as an

96
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
organization now

97
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
and and this may come to a surprise to

98
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
some of you but

99
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
um ones that you you may work in an

100
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,840
industry where you very much expect to

101
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
be the target of a nation state you may

102
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,959
be working in defending

103
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,760
um a government agency or perhaps

104
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,720
someone developing a

105
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,519
a vaccine or you know these types of

106
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,120
things maybe defense

107
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
traditional places you expect your

108
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,360
nation-state adversaries to be poking

109
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,920
around

110
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,519
nothing really changes for you right i

111
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,040
mean this has been going on for years

112
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,920
and if you're in those kind of

113
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,879
organizations

114
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,959
you've always got nation states uh

115
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,959
looking into your business

116
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,720
what's more concerning is some of the

117
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,159
nation states have

118
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,040
seemingly shifted to if not directly

119
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
attacking civilian targets

120
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,200
um making open season on civilian

121
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,319
targets

122
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,720
for people to meet their ends and the

123
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
two most common that we're seeing out

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,239
there the reason i have the two little

125
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,000
pictures down in the corner there is a

126
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
hidden cobra and a static kitten two of

127
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,680
the threat groups of course

128
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,840
that are known to be involved in some of

129
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
this but because of their behavior i

130
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
mean it's particularly

131
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,280
north korea which is generally

132
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
represented by cobras and snakes and

133
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,720
things like that by some of the other

134
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
security companies um they're kind of

135
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
after everybody right now in essence

136
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
um you know they're using ransomware to

137
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,040
fund

138
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,920
their nation state uh to some degree the

139
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,959
fbi

140
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
estimated that in 2020 over 10

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,920
percent of the gross domestic coast

142
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,160
domestic product of north korea

143
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918
came from cryptocurrency thefts and

144
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
ransoms so can you imagine 10

145
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,639
of your entire economy now is running on

146
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,280
stolen

147
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,000
digital money done through cyber attacks

148
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,440
it's an astounding figure

149
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
granted you know north korea doesn't

150
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,639
have a very functioning economy it

151
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
doesn't have a great gdp but

152
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,320
this is a survival skill for them at

153
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,759
this point and they are not

154
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,919
targeting typical nation state targets

155
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,520
they're targeting anyone they can rob

156
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,000
and steal

157
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
from and it's gotten a bit out of

158
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,080
control and i think most famously

159
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,960
uh we're all aware of the wannacry

160
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,759
attack

161
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
a few years back and of course wannacry

162
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
was ultimately attributed to

163
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,199
north korea and while they didn't make

164
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
any money on it

165
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
i think they learned from some of the

166
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
mistakes they made and

167
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
they recognized the opportunity for how

168
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,759
much money they could have made

169
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,800
considering the

170
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
gross amount of damages that were caused

171
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
to just a few organizations in that

172
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
attack and understood the value the

173
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
monetary value in doing this

174
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
so i think you know when we look at iran

175
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,240
they seem to be

176
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,919
in a very similar position and they seem

177
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,600
to be maybe marching down the same path

178
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
it's a little fuzzier in iran

179
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,759
exactly what's going on but uh we have

180
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,759
seen an increase in crypto

181
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,919
crypto mining attacks and an increase in

182
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,919
ransomware coming from iran as well

183
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,919
like north korea they have sanctions so

184
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,840
they may be eyeing a similar model for

185
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,800
ways to get

186
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
hard currency from foreign nations to

187
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
come into the iranian

188
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,039
economy and the victims that i've

189
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,120
investigated with the team at sofos and

190
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
others that we're aware of

191
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
uh have all just been regular civilian

192
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
organizations they're not organizations

193
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,320
with an affiliation with the government

194
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,759
with the military with the army

195
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,000
anything like that they're they're just

196
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
companies that can be attacked to make

197
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,039
money off of them

198
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,680
and the perpetrators seem to be i don't

199
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,039
know if they have a seal of approval

200
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,919
from the state but

201
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,680
they certainly don't seem to be

202
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,120
offending the state the state is not

203
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,000
taking any action

204
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
to stop any of this activity uh one of

205
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,520
the people we wrote a

206
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
blog post about recently that was

207
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
deploying crypto miners from iran

208
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
actually runs a legitimate computer

209
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
business in tehran

210
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,759
he doesn't even hide his name or address

211
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
or anything we could just look him up on

212
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
wikipedia

213
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
look him up on github and see the source

214
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
code for some of his malware on his

215
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
github that's directly tied to his

216
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,440
business name

217
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,199
which suggests that there's nothing to

218
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
fear uh you know if it's not

219
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
official government approval it's tacit

220
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,680
government approval but it means that

221
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
kind of every organization in the world

222
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,240
now has nation states either funding or

223
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,759
interested in coming after them

224
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,360
um and maybe not with the same

225
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,440
sophistication they have when they're

226
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
after the secret super duper missile

227
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,039
plans and things like that but

228
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,039
but it certainly is stepping up the game

229
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,720
it's also muddying the water when when

230
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
you're doing an investigation of an

231
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
attack it's getting

232
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
less and less clear and i don't know how

233
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
much time i'll have to to go into

234
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
details on this but but a lot of the

235
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
tools and techniques that are being used

236
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,520
by

237
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,160
uh nation state attackers are the same

238
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,039
as we're seeing

239
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
in this middle bucket and that middle

240
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
bucket there with the hacker stickers on

241
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,039
the laptop

242
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,720
i kind of call them advanced persistent

243
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
thieves this is the upper echelon

244
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
in the title of the presentation it said

245
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
the stratification of cyber crime and

246
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,960
and what i was referring to there is

247
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,479
that we we are kind of getting these

248
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,240
layers of sophistication now

249
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
at the top layer clearly it's the nation

250
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
states themselves not

251
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
necessarily of the their endorsed

252
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
citizens who may be attacking people

253
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
um they have the most sophisticated

254
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
tools generally that next step now

255
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
i call advanced persistent thieves and

256
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
that's your riots and your reveals and

257
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,479
your kanti's and

258
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,919
you know these ransomware gangs that are

259
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,599
regularly in the headlines asking for a

260
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,360
million plus dollar ransoms

261
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
we've seen upwards of 30 million dollars

262
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
in some of the victims that we've helped

263
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,280
out

264
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,520
i saw um of course last week it was in

265
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,599
the news that acer computers was hit

266
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
and demanded 50 million dollars right

267
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,680
the people doing those kind of crimes

268
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
are in this advanced persistent thief

269
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
bucket and you know to be fair most of

270
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
their skills seem to be

271
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,400
in that zone of a um a mid-level pen

272
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,080
tester let's say i know a lot of people

273
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,599
that do pen testing and there's a few of

274
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
them that truly and generally scare me

275
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,360
and i worry for my own network if they

276
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
were to come after me even though i i

277
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,639
spend so much of my time and effort

278
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
focusing on how to secure it uh

279
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
the the mid-tier ones are the ones that

280
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,960
i have confidence that i can block but i

281
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
have to make an active effort to block

282
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,800
them

283
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,319
it's not easy to keep those mid-level

284
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,000
people out i have to i have to

285
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
consciously do

286
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
a lot of things in order to secure my

287
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
network but if i do them

288
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
they're not getting in um they're not uh

289
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
they're not giving talks at black hat

290
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,479
anytime soon

291
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,480
and these are the ones i think that are

292
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,519
the most dangerous i'm gonna spend the

293
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
most time talking about today

294
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
because that's the ones of the quantity

295
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,160
of them out there that are starting to

296
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,600
really take down our networks and

297
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
in larger and larger numbers and they're

298
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,959
not interested in consumers right so

299
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,240
we've seen this real shift

300
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,480
in the attack economy well we're not

301
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,279
seeing the

302
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,880
the mass drive by stuff we used to see

303
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
in the days of flash and java

304
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
uh causing so much disruption and that's

305
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
all shifted into

306
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
targeting organizations for large sums

307
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
of money uh and picking them off one at

308
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,040
a time using

309
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,680
human-led attack skills rather than

310
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
wormable exploits per se

311
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,519
and the last category there that's a

312
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,120
that's a little cut and paste

313
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,160
action that you see on the right and um

314
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,440
and they're still out there and causing

315
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
some trouble i mean the the what do you

316
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,160
want to call them script kitties or what

317
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,519
you want to refer to them as

318
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
there is a lower tier of people trading

319
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,560
hacking tools they don't really

320
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,600
understand how they work and they're

321
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,560
just kind of throwing

322
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
throwing everything at the wall to see

323
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
what sticks and they have plenty of

324
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
success right

325
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
there's two particular ransom groups

326
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
still doing this one's called dharma

327
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,040
another one's called stop ransomware um

328
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,720
great information coverage

329
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,760
on those if you're interested in

330
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,440
learning more about how they work we've

331
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
written some articles on our

332
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,959
blog as well as bleeping computer always

333
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,880
has fantastic information on ransomware

334
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,519
groups and

335
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
and detailed write-ups uh and they're

336
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,680
having success against

337
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,240
the low-hanging fruit so if you do have

338
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,160
some unprotected assets out there

339
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,760
they may get hit by some of these groups

340
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,279
they may hit desktop computers within

341
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,720
your organization

342
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,560
um for a few hundred dollars or a few

343
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
thousand dollars equivalent

344
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,839
uh you know per per victim

345
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,680
but they don't have a lot of success

346
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
right because they don't have zero days

347
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,120
they don't have java and flash to attack

348
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,200
anymore their social engineering skills

349
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,519
are

350
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
are weak at best in in a lot of cases so

351
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,720
uh

352
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,079
they're really just throwing out

353
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
quantities and hoping a few things stick

354
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,480
but

355
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,839
you know on average some of these groups

356
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,920
are netting between a thousand and fifty

357
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,200
thousand dollars per victim so it's

358
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,040
still a pretty good day at the office if

359
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
you're a criminal

360
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
um to do that activity

361
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,560
so now if we look at the the how uh

362
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,079
how do these things change from the way

363
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,000
they were a few years ago and we've seen

364
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
this evolution coming over

365
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,000
the past 10 or 15 years but it was

366
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,079
rather slow moving until recently

367
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,440
uh if you remember if you've been

368
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
working for a while in this business you

369
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,000
probably remember the

370
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
the age of exploit kits uh they're still

371
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,079
out there but largely exploit kits

372
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,399
you know they shine from uh the late

373
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,760
2000s to the

374
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,200
mid 2018s black hole exploit kit was

375
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
probably the most famous one and and

376
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,079
that was kind of the beginning

377
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,600
of this idea of there being

378
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
specialization in jobs

379
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,320
uh of how you provide tools to others to

380
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
commit the crimes right whoever was

381
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
behind the black hole explicit i can't

382
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,680
remember

383
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,959
the guy's name he was eventually

384
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,880
arrested uh all he did was

385
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
like write the exploits and then sell

386
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,800
the kit he didn't deploy the malware he

387
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
didn't write the malware

388
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
he was just what we would now call an

389
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,680
initial access broker somebody who gets

390
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
initial access to a victim's computer

391
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,279
and then delivers a payload on behalf of

392
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,040
someone else and that was kind of the

393
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,959
beginning of this sort of uh

394
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
stratification of the underground

395
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
markets where they became

396
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,320
jobs and around that same time we also

397
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,800
saw uh there was mass credit card theft

398
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
going on particularly in the united

399
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,839
states because they had not adopted chip

400
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,639
cards yet

401
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,079
and it was very easy to steal credit

402
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,920
card mag stripes from memory

403
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,680
and in that time period we started

404
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
seeing that market do the same thing

405
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
where suddenly

406
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
one person's job was to manage the money

407
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
mules that would use the stolen cards to

408
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,760
go get money out of cash machines

409
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
and that's all that person did they

410
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,560
didn't know anything about malware they

411
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
were people people they just knew how to

412
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,279
recruit and heard those uh

413
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,800
mules to go out and take money out of

414
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
cash machines and somebody else's job

415
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,240
within the criminal group was to

416
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
acquire blank plastic cards and imprint

417
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,279
the mag stripes with the stolen card

418
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,560
information so that then they could be

419
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,200
taken

420
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
and used by those mules and somebody

421
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
else's job was to write the malware to

422
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
collect those mac stripes into memory so

423
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,240
we've seen this expand out further and

424
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,279
further as

425
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
as this criminal market has gotten more

426
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
and more

427
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,880
um well endowed with cash let's call it

428
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,600
and

429
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,680
um there's lots of this trading going on

430
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
and most of it unfortunately with the

431
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,480
groups that we're most interested in is

432
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,839
being done behind the scenes we're not

433
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,519
seeing this being done in the open

434
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,000
occasionally we do see people uh selling

435
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
for example ransomware as a service

436
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,600
through some forums that we have access

437
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,880
to in particular you see that with

438
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,720
groups like revel

439
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,399
they do have affiliates and they do

440
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,240
sometimes recruit somewhat openly for

441
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,040
affiliates

442
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
but as far as the relationship they have

443
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,560
with their

444
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
uh money laundering groups or things

445
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,639
like that those transactions are mostly

446
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,000
done in private but we can tell that

447
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,440
they're distinct groups in many cases

448
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
based on code analysis based on

449
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
analysis of ransom notes based on other

450
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,639
ways we're able to analyze things we can

451
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,600
kind of see there's

452
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
repeat operators doing jobs for

453
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
different groups and different people

454
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,920
in order to get these things done most

455
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,279
efficiently because they're very good at

456
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,600
them

457
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,320
and primarily you see of course money

458
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,959
laundering

459
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,240
uh usually being done through

460
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,160
cryptocurrencies of course so lots and

461
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,040
lots of

462
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,720
bitcoin wallets and coin tumbling and

463
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
moving things from bitcoin to ethereum

464
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,800
to

465
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
and back to bitcoin and then ultimately

466
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,399
cashing it out through

467
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,880
um over-the-counter traded stocks in

468
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,639
china and things like that in order to

469
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,399
make the money disappear

470
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
another specialization that you may i'm

471
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,000
sure you've experienced in your inbox

472
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,079
whether uh and hopefully you noticed it

473
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,440
which is the quality of the phishing

474
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
attacks is increased dramatically and

475
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,839
they're hiring professional translators

476
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,079
to

477
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,480
write their emails and write their

478
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,680
document lures

479
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,920
so that they're incorrect english

480
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
spanish

481
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,560
french german whatever language they're

482
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
targeting in particular the

483
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
english language ones the you know the

484
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,760
quality of them is no longer such that

485
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,440
you can spot the mistakes

486
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,360
and again for the lure that's important

487
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,800
you know the ransom notes are still a

488
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
grammatical nightmare but they don't

489
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,839
need to at that point they once you're

490
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,440
the ransom note stage

491
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
there's there's no reason to pretend

492
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,399
that they're not criminals they're

493
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,600
they're admitting their criminals in

494
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,560
fact they're trying to use it to

495
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
intimidate you

496
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,519
so they're putting the focus and effort

497
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
into the the social engineering lures

498
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,560
but they're hiring professional

499
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,079
people that are native speakers of those

500
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,000
languages to help craft

501
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
these phishing attacks which is leading

502
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,920
to a much higher yield of victims that

503
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,519
are getting drawn into those attacks and

504
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,240
of course

505
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
professional coders of different uh um

506
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
skill sets are helping write the malware

507
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
and and and again there's a bit of a

508
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,680
distinction with some of the groups i

509
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,880
don't think it's actually that important

510
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,240
to study the groups i think it's

511
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,680
important to defend against all of them

512
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,639
but we do see some groups specialize in

513
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,160
being technically sophisticated and

514
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
coming up with new ways

515
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,480
to bypass protection technologies like

516
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,079
networker and doppelpaymer

517
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,399
whereas other groups like rival and maze

518
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,360
before they

519
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,639
retired in october last year uh

520
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,120
seem to focus in the hype right it's all

521
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,680
about the

522
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
i'm going to dump the data publicly i'm

523
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,399
going to try to get media attention i'm

524
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,600
going to embarrass the company until

525
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,480
they pay

526
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,120
and while their malware is sophisticated

527
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,600
enough

528
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,560
it it's not employing new techniques

529
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,320
that we've never seen before to bypass

530
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,759
technologies if you've got solid

531
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,199
technology in place

532
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,399
you're generally somewhat safe

533
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
unless they can turn it off which is a

534
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
whole other kettle of fish

535
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,959
so uh you know anything can be for price

536
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,880
i i just went hunting around on some

537
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,079
dark websites that i

538
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,079
monitor occasionally and this was just

539
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,600
an example of what we were talking about

540
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,519
i found vladimir and george here

541
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,680
who are offering services of different

542
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,800
hacking things

543
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,959
uh what they'll do for how much uh how

544
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,320
much money and

545
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,560
you just get an idea of it's somewhat in

546
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,079
the open it's almost always done in

547
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,440
bitcoin even though

548
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,920
um some of the underground markets now

549
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,680
are under heavy pressure to move from

550
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
bitcoin to monero

551
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
so you'll see um uh the especially the

552
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,480
market selling drugs and guns and

553
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
malware

554
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
uh are are being pushed strongly toward

555
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
not accepting bitcoins anymore because

556
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,079
of the traceability

557
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,279
and moving to monaro where they have

558
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,519
more anonymity and i suspect

559
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,360
you know bitcoin will probably vanish

560
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
from those markets bitcoin is never

561
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
going to vanish from the ransomware

562
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,199
market because

563
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,720
victims know what a bitcoin is they've

564
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
heard of it and they can probably buy it

565
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,839
and that's really important to the

566
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,040
crooks but when they're buying things

567
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,240
from each other

568
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,000
they you know want their anonymity from

569
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
one another as well because there's been

570
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
a lot of takedowns in the last few years

571
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,440
by the

572
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,880
international law enforcement and that's

573
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,720
one of the ways they can ferret out

574
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,480
who's doing business with whom

575
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,720
and by getting bitcoin out of that it

576
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,639
lowers their risk uh another level

577
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,040
so we'll talk a little bit about ttps or

578
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
how they're actually doing this to

579
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
uh i wanted to take an example of one of

580
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
the more sophisticated modern attacks

581
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:02,959
that we

582
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,160
had the opportunity to document uh and

583
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
uh i found i was looking for images of

584
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
what a con you know what a conte might

585
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,439
be and it turns out it's a

586
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,839
um a portuguese beer i don't know if

587
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
it's in portugal portuguese or if it's

588
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,959
brazilian portuguese but i found that

589
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,760
can of

590
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,280
conte that i thought well that's kind of

591
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,039
odd i don't know what the

592
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,240
actual malware is named for

593
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,599
but this is sort of the process that

594
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,200
they took

595
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
getting into this particular victim they

596
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
they

597
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,600
you know first they got to get that

598
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,679
initial access and again remember this

599
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,120
is probably a different

600
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,880
group than conti themselves it's it's

601
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
unlikely that any of the modern

602
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,600
ransomware groups are actually hacking

603
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,480
into your network

604
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
somebody else is hacking into a computer

605
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
recognizing that oh wait man i broke

606
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
into this computer and look

607
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,559
it's part of a company and this

608
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,480
company's large enough that they

609
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,120
probably have

610
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,200
some money and maybe i can sell this

611
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,039
victim on to these ransomware guys that

612
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,480
i have a relationship with through the

613
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,600
underground

614
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,039
and in this particular case that we were

615
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,600
investigating it was an unpatched uh

616
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,760
fortigate firewall that they broke in

617
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
through uh from fortinet

618
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,039
that uh you know the patch had been out

619
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
for months but that hadn't been applied

620
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,360
so

621
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,320
it was kind of easy pickings for the um

622
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,640
and

623
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,000
and this is pretty common almost

624
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,520
everything we see in 2020 at the

625
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
beginning of these attacks starts with a

626
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
hacked remote access device of some

627
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,679
type they're either attacking the citrix

628
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
um or what was called the citrix

629
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,600
vulnerability at the end of 2019

630
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,679
uh they're attacking fortigate they're

631
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,000
attacking pulse secure vpns um they're

632
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,720
attacking

633
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,840
sometimes uh um

634
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
uh i'm trying to forget the name of it

635
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
now that starts with an s uh

636
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,679
but uh they're going after vpns and

637
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,880
other remote access stuff

638
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,160
and and above and beyond that rdp

639
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,600
if there's an rdp server open they're

640
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,480
just going to pound it guessing

641
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
passwords until they get in

642
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,559
and uh and or just fish somebody for a

643
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,160
legitimate password from the it team

644
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
especially one that might have the

645
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,799
ability to elevate privilege to

646
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,000
administrators so

647
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,039
this is almost always how they're

648
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
getting in at the start occasionally

649
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
they start with a phishing attack or a

650
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,039
document but

651
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,559
most of the investigations we did in

652
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,400
2020 always come back to some remote

653
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
access device that was either unpatched

654
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
the credentials had been previously

655
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
fished and there was no multi-factor

656
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
authentication

657
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,799
or was just legitimate access again

658
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,160
without multi-factor that they were able

659
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,720
to

660
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,080
password guess and then uh the first

661
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,520
thing they did was deploy

662
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
cobalt strike in a very generic fashion

663
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,360
and if you follow

664
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,039
derby khan and many of the jokes in the

665
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,880
infosec community you can look up

666
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
trevor forget about a bug in somebody's

667
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,400
milkshake uh

668
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,760
they literally use that code for

669
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,720
verbatim uh for the http stager for

670
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,080
cobalt strike uh

671
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,919
in in in the attack they didn't even

672
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,120
bother modifying it

673
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,320
uh you can see the screenshot in the

674
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
lower right uh that we

675
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,679
discovered on the victims machine and

676
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,000
that matches up with publicly published

677
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,039
uh things called the trevor forget code

678
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,600
then they did a reflective attack and

679
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,240
loaded a

680
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,520
a sword loader uh of interpreter into

681
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,120
memory and again this was an entirely

682
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,559
fileless attack and this is one of the

683
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,679
other challenges when you're

684
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,960
when you're in the panic of dealing with

685
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,919
one of these incidents and you're

686
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,120
responding to them you want to figure

687
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,400
out what the criminal's been up to and

688
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
how they got in

689
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,960
because they're unlikely to give up if

690
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,640
you knock them off of one server and in

691
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
fact i don't have all the details here

692
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,520
if you're interested in more details

693
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
go to our news.sophos.com blog we did an

694
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,799
entire write-up on

695
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,240
this attack with all of the technical

696
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
detail of the malware and technical

697
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,320
detect

698
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,919
the detail of how the attackers pivoted

699
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,679
around the network but the

700
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,400
they got onto one server and eventually

701
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,880
the

702
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,520
uh it team was able to get control of

703
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
that server recognize that they were

704
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,440
there

705
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,799
lock them out again but they'd already

706
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,720
pivoted to more servers and because

707
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
it was fileless it was really hard for

708
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,240
the victim to trace where that thing had

709
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,840
gone and where it might be

710
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
in their network and so they didn't

711
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,799
realize another server was compromised

712
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,440
where the

713
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
attackers continued their attack even

714
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
though the defenders thought that they

715
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,000
had locked them out

716
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,159
so it this is becoming more and more

717
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,360
common

718
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,799
and then they loaded another piece of

719
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,880
cobalt strike into memory

720
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
they double obfuscated it they both

721
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
obfuscated it using a packer but in

722
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,679
addition to packing it

723
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,000
they also did what's called api by hash

724
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
where instead of calling api names by

725
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,520
the name of the api for example like

726
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,919
get host by name to do a dns lookup you

727
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,880
actually hash

728
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,679
the api names and you call the hash of

729
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,679
the api name rather than the api name

730
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,440
which just makes it miserable to reverse

731
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,039
engineer for folks

732
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,559
like the people that helped me out in

733
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,640
sofas labs

734
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,799
and then it wormed over smb all around

735
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,400
the network once they had

736
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,159
valid administrative creds they can copy

737
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,000
it to the dollar shares

738
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,840
all over the network to spread the

739
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,360
malware around to position it in staging

740
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
each in this case they actually embed a

741
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
rsa public key

742
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,200
into the malware itself so that they

743
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,320
don't need to contact command and

744
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,679
control so as soon as they infect the

745
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,480
machine

746
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,159
they don't need any outbound access to a

747
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,520
command and control server

748
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,039
because the public key is built into the

749
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,559
malware and they just put a unique

750
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,320
public key in per victim because it's

751
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,679
being deployed by hand it doesn't need

752
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,600
to be automated in any fashion because

753
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,120
humans are actually behind the keyboard

754
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,640
publishing it

755
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,480
this is almost a hallmark of a lot of

756
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
ransomware attacks now which is

757
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
the data gets exfiltrated to mega which

758
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,320
is kim.com's file sharing service that

759
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,679
he

760
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,240
hosts depending how you feel about

761
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960
kim.com you may be a fan or a not fan of

762
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
of mega and but that's where a lot of

763
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,960
the data is being extra traded now

764
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,640
they'll often bring bring along a

765
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,039
a client that can connect directly to

766
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,720
mega's apis and do the upload to

767
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
accelerate it make it a little faster

768
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,080
than doing it over https

769
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,919
uh but if that doesn't work then they'll

770
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,280
just run it through a proxy and just go

771
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,880
to the mega website and do it that way

772
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,159
they've got several different utilities

773
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,440
that are commonly used

774
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
and then ultimately of course publish

775
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
some of that information on the dark web

776
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,520
in order to extort the victim into

777
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
paying so that's sort of the

778
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,320
the flow of a very typical attack

779
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,679
and mapping this out loosely into um

780
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,480
not very uh definitive attack framework

781
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,159
buckets but just kind of giving an idea

782
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:50,720
again

783
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
you know the beginning is sometimes a

784
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,400
fish clearly probably not emitted

785
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,840
anymore because emma that's gone but

786
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,240
it's

787
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,400
the most famous example i could think of

788
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
uh that was successful

789
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,000
in in the last year or two uh and

790
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
through remote access devices whether

791
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,159
that's citrix or pulse secure or rdp

792
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,200
proceeding on to uh living off the land

793
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,000
and this is just

794
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
pretty much every attack now right we

795
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,039
did not see the criminals almost never

796
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,400
bring their own attack tools

797
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,240
if they do they're heavily obfuscated

798
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,080
power shell and they're doing that

799
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,000
reflective dll loading into memory where

800
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
they can do fileless

801
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
attacks and nothing hits the disk to not

802
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,799
trigger a lot of antivirus and things

803
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,679
like that

804
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,039
and heavy use of an abuse of tools that

805
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,159
are already present and

806
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,799
used by that i.t team often we've even

807
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,480
seen them go to the point of using your

808
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
software deployment uh

809
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
strategy internally to deploy the

810
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
malware itself

811
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
and scanning your network using copies

812
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
of nmap that they find laying around

813
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
using pskill ps exact all the system

814
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,279
turtles tools

815
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,039
a lot of reliance on powershell these

816
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,400
days and

817
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
cobalt strike an interpreter frequently

818
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,679
used as well

819
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,960
which is a little surprising to me

820
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,480
because it's so well known to security

821
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
tools it's bound to

822
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
set off an alarm somewhere but they are

823
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,039
still using them

824
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,679
and disabling backups especially cloud

825
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,640
things like veeam

826
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,400
they'll look for s3 buckets or veeam

827
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
services those types of things to kill

828
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,200
your backups if they're online

829
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,640
too many companies are no longer doing

830
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
offline backups they're not sending the

831
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,159
tapes in the bucket off to the

832
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,679
warehouse to be stored and because of

833
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,880
that they can delete them while they're

834
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
online and put the company in a worse

835
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,520
position and of course

836
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
in the end they've got a gun to your

837
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,360
head i've got about five more limits

838
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,480
left so i'm just going to talk about

839
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,400
defense before we get ready

840
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
um for those of you who stayed that

841
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,159
stayed in track one it says all canadian

842
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,520
ending to besides dublin

843
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,080
strangely enough my my friend and

844
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,960
colleague

845
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,360
rob slade before me did a fantastic job

846
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,880
talking about homomorphic encryption and

847
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,240
i'll have the uh

848
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,799
the great uh pleasure of being the last

849
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,640
person to speak before dave lewis does

850
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,440
the

851
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
lock note i'm curious what a lock note

852
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
is i've been meaning to ask that but

853
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,919
dave is another well-known person in the

854
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,679
canadian security community and i hope

855
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,360
i hope you'll enjoy his presentation as

856
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,039
well

857
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,840
and on the sort of prevent detect and

858
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,919
respond side i mean this sounds stupid

859
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,120
and it's i'm really getting sick of

860
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,799
saying it to be honest but

861
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
every every victim we're helping out

862
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,559
these days just had bad hygiene

863
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,679
um poorly configured firewalls and often

864
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,799
no logging no sim

865
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,880
or no edr these are really the most

866
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
important parts on the front

867
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,840
prevention side and i know firewalls

868
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,320
sound like a very 20th century

869
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,000
idea but you need to think about

870
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,440
firewalls maybe differently than you

871
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,919
used to

872
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,840
and what i'm saying on a prevention side

873
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,279
i'm almost talking about preventing this

874
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,200
from growing out of control

875
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,720
we're talking about segmentation in the

876
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,039
network as much as we're talking about

877
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,960
um i mean ideally you'd be moving to

878
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,159
space and

879
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,360
ztna and these types of things uh

880
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,960
so that you're not worried about

881
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,640
firewalling but most of us aren't there

882
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,159
so if you're not there like almost every

883
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,760
other organization you do have firewalls

884
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,279
and if you do have firewalls

885
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,880
and you do have an inside network and a

886
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,320
dmz network and all these kinds of

887
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,120
things then

888
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,559
you need to be segmenting more and i

889
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,080
mean every major attack that's gotten

890
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,279
out of control that we've been involved

891
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,480
in and everyone i've read about the

892
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,039
press

893
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,640
there's been zero segmentation in those

894
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
networks once the criminals are able to

895
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:00,480
find

896
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,880
one way in there's nothing to stop them

897
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,320
from running roughshod over the entire

898
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,840
network and all of the data

899
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,080
and it's it's uh it's such a cheap

900
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,520
rudimentary thing they don't cost any

901
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,960
you can run them in virtual machines now

902
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,440
like

903
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,200
this isn't you're not buying watch guard

904
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,640
boxes and racking them like you did in

905
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,600
the old days

906
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
so you'll really look at how you might

907
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,520
use things you already have like that

908
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
better and get better at segmenting

909
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,919
edr is absolutely essential because you

910
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,120
when you're trying to react to a

911
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,000
situation

912
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
you need to know what's going on and you

913
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,120
need to know quickly and you don't want

914
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,480
to have to paste together seven

915
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,240
different systems information

916
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,679
in order to try to figure out what's

917
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,080
happening and certainly our

918
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,120
threat responders find edr to be the you

919
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,600
know

920
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,080
the most useful new tool in the arsenal

921
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,600
like most of the things we rely on are

922
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,120
actually old things that don't cost much

923
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,679
money

924
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,440
just know how to need to need to know

925
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,799
how to use them effectively

926
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,320
it's not about buying new shiny stuff

927
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
it's about being more strategic about

928
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
how we use the old shiny stuff

929
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
uh but in the case of edr i would say

930
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,200
that's that's the exception and

931
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,840
i i heard about a new um victim last

932
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,200
night that we were helping out

933
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,960
and again they had unpatched exchange

934
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,799
servers despite all the information

935
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,400
about hafnium going around

936
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,840
they had a plan they were planning on

937
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,120
patching the f you know against the

938
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,960
hefty invulnerabilities this weekend

939
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,000
but instead they got hit with the

940
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
ransomware yesterday so a little late

941
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
uh for them and unfortunately that that

942
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,640
two three week delay in patching is more

943
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,399
than enough to make them a victim

944
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,960
and and in so many of these cases even

945
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,799
reasonably well managed environments we

946
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,080
still see that

947
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,000
80 of the servers were protected but 10

948
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
of them weren't and that's all it takes

949
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,559
is one of them

950
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,080
and and then they can unlock the other

951
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,640
ones in in in many cases most cases if

952
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,279
they can

953
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,640
the first thing they do is disable the

954
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,840
security on everything else they only

955
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
have to find the one unprotected machine

956
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
that's a member of the domain and they

957
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
can unravel the whole thing like pulling

958
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,240
the thread on a sweater

959
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
so it's essential that it'd be

960
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,520
ubiquitous and

961
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,200
and if you spend all of your time on

962
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,360
hygiene you'll be far better ahead than

963
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,320
if you spend

964
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,240
all your time uh trying to do far more

965
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
sophisticated things if you're not that

966
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,320
far

967
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,279
along on the security maturity spectrum

968
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,399
and you have to just

969
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,480
recognize where you are in that maturity

970
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,159
and and focus on what you can do at the

971
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,760
maturity level you're at don't try to

972
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,880
leap ahead because you'll

973
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
you'll fail at everything as opposed to

974
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,840
being really good at least one thing

975
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,000
that's going to help defend

976
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,080
and then of course threat hunting if

977
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,039
you're mature enough

978
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,399
is the next step right you need to

979
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,399
really be able to detect and respond and

980
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,840
when the criminals break in more often

981
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,480
than not

982
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,399
there's a few telltale things that slow

983
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,600
them down and there's a few telltale

984
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,320
things that

985
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,000
that they're often doing and more often

986
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
than not within the first hour or two

987
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,559
of them breaching the network um to me i

988
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,200
liken it to

989
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
if a burglar were to break into your

990
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
house and knock over a plant

991
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
uh on the way in to the house and it

992
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,080
shatters and you hear it in the other

993
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,799
room

994
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,880
uh if we compare that to detecting a

995
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
piece of malware say

996
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,720
a cobalt strike or interpreter being

997
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,200
detected on a machine in your dmz

998
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,520
you might say hooray my sophos antivirus

999
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
or my power out strike or whatever i

1000
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,159
have

1001
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,360
detected cobalt strike fantastic close

1002
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,960
the incident because it worked

1003
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,559
but the truth is you need to open an

1004
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,000
incident because somebody's trying to

1005
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,120
get in and it's a human and they're not

1006
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,080
going to give up

1007
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,399
because sofos or cobalt or or

1008
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,159
crowdstrike detected their cobalt strike

1009
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,279
right they're just going to come back in

1010
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,240
10 minutes

1011
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,080
with an obfuscated one or a different

1012
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,559
tool that's not going to be detected by

1013
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,039
vendor

1014
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,240
y or product x and so when you hear the

1015
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,760
plant breaking when they break in the

1016
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,399
room

1017
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,480
you need to be in the position to uh

1018
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,240
to start an incident response and

1019
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,919
segmentation looking for things after

1020
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,919
hours and looking for data exfiltration

1021
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,200
are the primary ways you're going to see

1022
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,039
that something bad was happening so

1023
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,720
