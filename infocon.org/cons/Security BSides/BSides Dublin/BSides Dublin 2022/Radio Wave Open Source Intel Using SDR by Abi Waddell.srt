1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,480
i'm going to talk to you today about

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,520
what open source intel or osint we can

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,599
gather from radio waves

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,440
using software define radio

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,679
i hope this will be useful to red

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,080
teamers and other infosec professionals

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,320
who wouldn't normally consider including

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,640
in the scope of an engagement radio

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
transmissions especially outside of the

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,920
bluetooth and wi-fi frequency bands

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
i'm going to cover a bit on raw data

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,720
capture

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
and decoding along with ocean techniques

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
derived from advanced searches and

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
technical exploration to discover

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,480
sensitive device and user data and i'll

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,360
also touch on the legalities of such

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
radio interception

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,440
but why should we focus on open source

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,480
intel

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
the main reasons are to reduce the risk

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,160
of fruitful pre-attack recon activity

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
and by fruitful i mean that such

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
activity leads to a breach

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
the probability that intel from public

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
sources will be discovered and exploited

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,959
is high especially as this does not

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,680
usually require a high level of skill

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
leaks that are accessible to the wider

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
public have a high potential of causing

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
reputational damage

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
breach recon activities are not usually

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
captured by existing tools and methods

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,799
either pre or post-incident mainly

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,040
because such activities occur away from

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
the company network

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,360
the good news is that open source leaks

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,759
can largely be remedied with a small

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,680
effort but with a large impact on the

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,400
reduction of risk and finally by

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,479
considering public sources outside of

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,320
the corporate network one has a greater

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,639
visibility of the wider attack surface

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,159
and now i'm just going to give you a

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
very quick overview on getting started

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
with sdr with some of the equipment used

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,680
in radio scanning

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
so traditional hardware based scanners

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
look a bit like this on the left

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,079
they are expensive

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,920
usually costing between a few hundred

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
pounds to several hundred thousand

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
pounds and they have

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
limited or dedicated functions but do it

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,040
well

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
and they require less user input

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
it's usually a simple case of switching

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,680
on and turning some dials however there

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
is little potential for user

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,959
customization and it's not usually

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,560
possible to see the visual signal

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
patterns

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,000
a typical hobbyist setup may involve

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,239
using an sdr dongle which is about the

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,319
size of a usb stick perhaps a little

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,360
larger

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
and then an antenna which can work on

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,840
specific frequencies and may be able to

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
transmit as well as receive

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,040
some can be mounted on vehicles via a

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
magnetized base

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
and the sdr's dongle will usually be

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
plug and play which will work with most

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
operating systems and may or may not be

75
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
able to work as a transceiver

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,160
so this gives a brief brief spec of the

77
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,879
spy and a typical antenna

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,080
most such

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,360
sdr equipment comes to between 30 and

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
250 pounds depending on what you want to

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,080
use it for and how reliable you need it

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,159
to be sorry i said that in pounds and

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,519
not euros

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
but yeah you get the idea

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,120
sdr sharp is a popular software app for

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,640
sdr dongles

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
and it's easy to use and has a multitude

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,280
of modules that allows you to do some

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,800
pretty cool things

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
so many sdr programs share similar

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
features

92
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,640
and there is a screen showing the visual

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,239
signal patterns

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,400
and an option to select the frequencies

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,760
and filters

96
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
frequencies are shown clearly and the

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,239
app has some helpful labels for some of

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,159
the bandwidth allocations

99
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,040
for instance military air fm radio and

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,319
other bands

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,239
and the peaks represent the signal

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
strength and time and are extremely

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,840
helpful when discerning what to listen

104
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,400
to specific frequencies can be saved and

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,040
communications recorded

106
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
one of the most useful features is the

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,519
automatic frequency scanner

108
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,280
which saves you the trouble of manually

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,040
searching for communications that you

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
might want to listen to

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,120
and one other nifty module is the

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
digital radio decoder which can decode

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
various digital protocols such as p25

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,280
dmr and

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,639
d-star web sdr allows one oops what's

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,160
going on there

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,160
there you go sorry my computer's slow

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,040
uh

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,040
okay

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,840
it's not gonna stay

121
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,539
[Music]

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
okay

123
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,280
okay

124
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
okay um

125
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,720
sorry about that i will just talk about

126
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
web sdr without showing you that

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,100
particular slide that's a bit odd

128
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,000
[Laughter]

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
so um

130
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,919
so basically web sdr allows one to

131
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
listen in on others

132
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,000
sdr and antenna setup without having to

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,479
get any special equipment yourself only

134
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
a web browser is needed

135
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,240
so it's possible to browse to various

136
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
web sdl servers in the world and tune

137
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,720
into whatever their antenna can pick up

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
and the dashboard for each is very

139
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,639
similar and very easy to use so you get

140
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
the waterfall display and the option to

141
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,600
fine tune the frequency that you want to

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
and you can squelch background

143
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,960
interference noise alter the volume and

144
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
make recordings

145
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
and

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
on the screen you can also see who else

147
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
is connected to the server so this

148
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
sometimes helps to see which bands and

149
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,319
frequencies are the most popular to

150
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,160
listen to if you actually need any

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
inspiration

152
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,080
um so the modulation such as usb cw or

153
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
am can be changed along with other

154
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
settings so

155
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,680
this is it a bit better this time no

156
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
okay let's see

157
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,440
right so um

158
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
here is a live police message i heard by

159
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
a web sdr

160
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,120
um a via a server based in cleveland

161
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,520
ohio it's quite surprising the sort of

162
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,199
sensitive information that one can pick

163
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,599
up over the air such as usernames

164
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,000
criminal records car license plate

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,479
numbers physical and email addresses and

166
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
passwords so basically such

167
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,560
sensitive information however has been

168
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,080
removed from this particular clip but it

169
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,960
kind of gives you an idea so i'm just

170
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
gonna

171
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,400
i'm not a female called

172
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,919
caller said inside of this location i

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,080
can hear a female screaming

174
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,759
also believes there's three other people

175
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,960

[Music]

183
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,280
and uh this is a chat between two radio

184
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
hams that was randomly stumbled on

185
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,759
at various points

186
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,440
people on this channel had mentioned

187
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
usernames and passwords um in this clip

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
they are discussing buying guns and

189
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,960
ammunition apologies for the poor sound

190
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,440
quality i think this will be

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,639
um but note such conversations are not

192
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,960
meant to be hidden from

193
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,639
uh general scanners

194
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,400
but it's actually surprising what is

195
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
discussed

196
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,680
you don't have to worry about the

197
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
background check but everybody thinks

198
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,039
that when you fill out those papers it

199
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,960
goes into a national registry it does

200
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
not

201
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,159
where i picked up my five seven uh

202
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,880
and that's a fun little pistol you won't

203
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,039
have

204
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,399
you know what i'm i'm going to be

205
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,640
planning on going to j g gun sales out

206
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
there and and have a look and see what

207
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,920
the availability is of the uh uh 22

208
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,959
magnum

209
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,519
i bought my first ak from them one time

210
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,200
they had a deal back in the early 90s

211
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
where you could buy them ak and you got

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,959
a thousand rounds or 1100 rounds or

213
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,720
something with it and i'm going to tell

214
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,800
them

215
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
i'll fix the check it right now

216
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,800
tell me that 5.56

217
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,000
that's not a good price because i bought

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
a thousand rounds

219
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
and i didn't even have a gun they had

220
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
them they were putting them in the

221
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
shelves at walmart

222
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
i said just throw that thousand rounds

223
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
in my

224
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
in my cart it was about a little over

225
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,480
hundred dollars i think so a little over

226
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,360
40 cents around

227
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
um it's usually very useful when radio

228
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,720
scanning to have the ability to

229
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,800
physically locate the source of any

230
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
transmission and this is just to

231
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
summarize some of the methods of doing

232
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
this

233
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,839
triliteration requires the distance

234
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,600
between the receiver and the transmitter

235
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
to be measured each receiving station

236
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,839
measures the length of time taken for

237
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,760
the radio signal to reach their position

238
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,240
and when the times from three or more

239
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
such stations are known a position for

240
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
the receiver can be calculated

241
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
each receiving station has an

242
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,640
omnidirectional antenna and a very

243
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,839
precise clock in order to have any

244
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,519
accuracy a variant on this is time

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,040
difference of arrival where you can

246
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
locate a signal source from the

247
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
different arrival times at the receivers

248
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,000
triangulation can be used with multiple

249
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
fixed position receiving stations or it

250
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
can be used with a single mobile station

251
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
which has a directional antenna and

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,640
determines the angle which the receiver

253
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
which signal is received from

254
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,120
keeping the same reference point such as

255
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
magnetic north and when this angle is

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
taken from three or more different

257
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
positions the location of the

258
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
transmitter can be calculated

259
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,200
it's also possible to use a directional

260
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
antenna to determine the position of the

261
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,519
transmitter by using the antenna

262
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,600
orientation producing the strongest

263
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
signal to indicate the direction of the

264
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,560
transmitter

265
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
you can then take two measurements from

266
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,000
known transmitters in order to be able

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
to apply the triangulation

268
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
directional antennas show an increase or

269
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,959
decrease of the received signal strength

270
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
depending on the physical location at

271
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
rotation and the doppler shift method

272
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
analyzes the received signals and

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
determines the probable direction from

274
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
which the signal originates

275
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,640
correlative interferometry is about

276
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,120
moving receivers perhaps in a vehicle

277
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,480
and how different measurements at

278
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
different positions of the vehicle's

279
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,760
trajectory are taken into account

280
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
transmissions sometimes have to be

281
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,120
processed further in order to understand

282
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,240
the content

283
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,399
raw captured data which has been encoded

284
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,800
or encrypted can either be processed on

285
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,240
the fly at the time that they are

286
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,399
received by the sdr software

287
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,480
using various modules or this data could

288
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
be saved to a file usually a packet

289
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,639
capture file for offline analysis

290
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,959
so what can we listen to so this is not

291
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,519
meant to be an exhaustive list and no

292
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
i'm not saying you should listen to

293
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
these but here are a few

294
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,240
so illegal fishing boys can be detected

295
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,079
especially as they often transmit in

296
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,120
bands which they are not authorized to

297
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,279
number stations these are shortwave

298
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
radio stations that transmit encrypted

299
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
secret messages

300
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,800
in the form of numbers thought to be

301
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,880
used by government agents the numbers

302
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
are sent on pre-determined frequencies

303
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,519
with the use of automated voice morse

304
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,839
code or digital modes

305
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,240
most use a one-time pad encryption and

306
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
so only the person who has the has a

307
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,839
copy of the one-time pub will be able to

308
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,959
decode the message

309
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,639
stations are usually given a nickname

310
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,160
and many are well known because of the

311
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,959
music they play and each transmission

312
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,160
usually has an intro and an end phrase

313
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,839
so i'll just give you an example of

314
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,800
one 9

315
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,760
5

316
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,639

317
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,800
2

318
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,680
6

319
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,639
1

320
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,600
3

321
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,560

322
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,639

323
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,680

324
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,560

325
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,880

326
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,489
[Applause]

327
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,800
right

328
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,760
um

329
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,639
sorry about that so the seti project

330
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,279
aims to detect radio signals originating

331
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,600
from intelligent species in a in space

332
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,639
so it's like ocean for aliens basically

333
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
multiple stations around the world

334
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
monitor stars for a period of time to

335
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,639
collect the data and the collected audio

336
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,120
is analyzed using special software

337
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,160
long range low power wide area network

338
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
iot devices can be decoded and decrypted

339
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,279
but this appears to be a work in

340
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,639
progress

341
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,040
nice

342
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,839
decked cordless phones can be

343
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,519
unencrypted and usually have weak

344
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
encryption if encryption is used

345
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,839
iridium and in

346
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,839
satellite transmissions can be decoded

347
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
some wireless keyboards are vulnerable

348
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,199
to being sniffed by measuring the

349
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,279
received signal strength of messages

350
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
transmitted between the keyboard and the

351
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
dongle attached to the computer

352
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680
so looking at the timings between

353
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,079
different keystrokes and also using

354
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,120
machine

355
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,600
learning

356
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
you can look at the likelihood of a

357
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,680
particular word being entered by the

358
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
target user

359
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,360
military radio transmissions can be

360
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
picked up in the clear as particularly

361
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,839
if commercial handsets are in use

362
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
recently a set of bands for a particular

363
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,839
country's alleged military were

364
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,720
publicized on twitter

365
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,519
fake 4g base stations can be detected

366
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,839
using the crocodile hunter tool which

367
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,199
essentially decodes the master

368
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
information block and system information

369
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
block for a group of cells

370
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,519
and detects anomalies in these results

371
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,920
whilst determining the probable location

372
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
of these cells using radiolocation

373
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,760
techniques

374
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,399
and anomalies in the results include

375
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,639
cells that move location or change

376
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,000
strength or have missing parameters and

377
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
also cells being located in unexpected

378
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,160
places

379
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
and finally experiments have been done

380
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,040
to fingerprint wi-fi adapters using

381
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,120
radio frequency analysis and this has

382
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,399
around a 95 accuracy

383
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
pager messages can be intercepted and

384
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,040
decoded on the fly using sdr sharp and

385
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
other software pages are not so commonly

386
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,880
used these days but have a high

387
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
likelihood of their transmission being

388
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,920
captured because the signal travels over

389
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,680
over long distances

390
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,560
hospital staff and taxis still use pages

391
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,638
but the technology is being phased out

392
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
pager transmissions

393
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,519
have a very distinct waterfall view and

394
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,720
sound

395
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,759
sdr can also be used to detect oh sorry

396
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,440
pages uh

397
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,199
like baby monitors

398
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
which can be listened to in the clear

399
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,120
not just to listen to the immediate

400
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,360
vicinity but pick up sounds in

401
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
other rooms

402
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,759
both of these pages and baby monitors

403
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
shouldn't be really listened to from an

404
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,360
ethical standpoint but it's worth

405
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,839
mentioning because it's what people can

406
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,360
do and people need to be aware of that

407
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,000
so sdr can also be used to detect

408
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,079
emanations coming from electrical

409
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,160
equipment commonly known as a tempest

410
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,480
attack so this works by positioning the

411
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,040
sdr and antenna close to the monitor of

412
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,639
the victim computer and then picking up

413
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
the live image being displayed on this

414
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,519
device but on the attack computer

415
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
which is running the sdr software and

416
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,360
whilst it's easy and straightforward to

417
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,279
run the the tempest attack software

418
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,399
getting the technique to work

419
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
effectively is a bit hit and miss and

420
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
also requires being in very close like

421
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,600
within a few meters of the target device

422
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,399
ocean gathering can be put into

423
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,920
different categories according to the

424
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
type of repository of the data the

425
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,959
expected levels of permission to to this

426
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
data and the level of sensitivity

427
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,959
so this is an ocean data retrieval model

428
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,319
i created

429
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,799
as the tears go down the data generally

430
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
but not always is more sensitive and

431
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,799
requires more permission to access

432
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
so at the very top the mainstream

433
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
category includes anything freely

434
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,640
available to the public

435
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,119
the select category is data that's only

436
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,120
meant to be shared with a specific group

437
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,160
so this includes most free deep websites

438
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
down to privileged which requires an

439
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,799
applied for accounts

440
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,720
in order to access it

441
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,559
and such accounts usually require

442
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
payment or further verification

443
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,200
beyond a simple device

444
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,559
2fa for instance

445
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,960
and examples of this include pay for

446
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,240
news or media subscription size

447
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
and then down below the more invasive

448
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,120
methods

449
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
usually result in obtaining more

450
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,559
sensitive data but require greater

451
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,240
permission levels

452
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
any data out in the open from these

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
methods is likely to be from

454
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
unintentional leakage so an example

455
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
could be i'm emailing a hotel reception

456
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
about my room booking but they respond

457
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
to me with an email that is intended for

458
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,720
a different customer by mistake or a web

459
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,559
page is misconfigured and shows a list

460
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,400
of hidden files and directories which

461
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
anyone can access if they are

462
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,600
technically able to find the

463
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,160
misconfigured url

464
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,320
so what follows now are ways of

465
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,640
obtaining ocean data relating to radio

466
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,160
transmitters and users

467
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,280
the radio reference site and this area

468
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
on the ofcom site allow one to search

469
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,919
for organizations owned license

470
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,240
frequencies with location details of

471
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
their transmitters in the example is one

472
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
such big blue chip companies

473
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,080
transmitters in the uk i'm not saying

474
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,960
who but this again is freely open and

475
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,559
available this sort of information

476
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,320
in the united states the fcc site has a

477
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,799
search facility to look up callsign

478
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,039
frequencies and use and site addresses

479
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,879
of licensees and other information

480
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,840
the signal identification

481
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,360
there we go

482
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,760
sorry

483
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,559
okay it's taking a long time sorry about

484
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,720
this

485
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
okay we skipped ahead

486
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,640
um the signal identification wiki site

487
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
which is on the previous slide it's not

488
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
working i'm sorry about that

489
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,280
okay that's useful for looking up the

490
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,440
frequency bands and include samples of

491
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
what these signals look like

492
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,039
and here there are various sites that

493
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,080
show live movements and of flights and

494
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,160
ships such as radar box and vessel

495
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,679
finder

496
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,880
the wspr or whisper network which stands

497
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
for weak signal propagation reporter is

498
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,039
a global set of transmitting and

499
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,320
receiving

500
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,640
whisper radio stations that document any

501
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,200
spots or detections on specific radio

502
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,960
transmissions of specific radio

503
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
transmissions

504
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,159
so a single whisper link

505
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,919
can provide detection of an aircraft

506
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
along its propagation path using using

507
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,400
high frequency transmissions over

508
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,559
several thousand kilometers

509
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,640
multiple whisper links synchronized at

510
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
the same time can provide more specific

511
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
data and it's possible to track an

512
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,880
aircraft as it will produce a scatter of

513
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,559
radio signals

514
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,320
it was possible to track some of the

515
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
journey of the doomed missing malaysian

516
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
flight mh370 using this method as all

517
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,400
search efforts hadn't met with any

518
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
success

519
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,559
open cell id is a useful site to see the

520
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,039
location and details of cell towers

521
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,039
and the helium explorer map shows the

522
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,440
location of all the active helium crypto

523
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,799
currency mining devices

524
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,320
if you suspect a particular device of

525
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
interest either because

526
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
it of its owner or its possible

527
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,520
geographical location it's possible to

528
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
find out more about this device if it's

529
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,080
an iphone and has the find my iphone

530
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,720
service enabled and you know the user's

531
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,360
icloud credentials because one can skip

532
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,440
the two-factor authentication in order

533
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,000
to use the app via a browser

534
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
obviously this is a feature which is

535
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
there by design as it allows users who

536
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,840
have lost their phone to find it

537
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,159
and they only need to log into icloud to

538
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,640
do this

539
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,919
so if an unauthorized user user has

540
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,679
possession of the victim's icloud

541
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,760
credentials they can go right in and see

542
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,080
the phone model they use and also their

543
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
geographical location

544
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,960
knowing that the user has an iphone

545
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
12 here we can assume that ultra

546
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,360
wideband may be in use and this

547
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
information may be useful if conducting

548
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
further assessments in the locality

549
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,919
ultra wideband is a radio technology

550
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,480
that can use a very low energy level for

551
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,559
a short range high bandwidth

552
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,799
communications and is particularly

553
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,919
suited to precision location activities

554
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,919
apple was the first to introduce this in

555
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,400
smartphones and the advantage of this

556
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
over wifi and bluetooth is that it uses

557
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,320
less power has greater location accuracy

558
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,559
some of the ultra wide band applications

559
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,760
for phones

560
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,000
include the apple car key

561
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,640
improved seamless media file transfers

562
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,840
and connection with home iot devices

563
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,520
the sby server map shows users who have

564
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,000
registered their sdrs as servers on this

565
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,919
site and this show which are live their

566
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,240
location and other details like the

567
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,880
operating system the type of device in

568
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
use i p address

569
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,320
and username

570
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
and with the location coordinates given

571
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,600
in the previous step or even with the ip

572
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,360
address from which one can discover a

573
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,840
related map location it is then possible

574
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,400
to target surrounding radio frequency

575
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,880
transmitters including wi-fi hotspots by

576
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
using the advertised sdr server to scan

577
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
for signals in the locality

578
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,400
this is within the bounds of open source

579
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,480
as the sdr server is meant to be

580
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,840
accessed by the public

581
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
another way of looking for iot device

582
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,640
information is to access their enabled

583
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,960
and open ports and services

584
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,679
routers which also run cellular and rf

585
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,480
services are often accessible this way

586
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,799
so this nebra hotspot miner device was

587
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,720
accessed over this specific port and

588
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,520
showed the device's version the mac

589
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,918
address

590
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,080
the helium address and frequency

591
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,840
the other example on the right shows the

592
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,559
files accessible over anonymous ftp on

593
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,240
port 21 on a

594
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,919
samsung dvr device

595
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,679
this 4g iot netcom device login screen

596
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,600
was accessed over a browser in the same

597
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,400
way

598
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
it wasn't necessary to log in in order

599
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
to see the status details which showed

600
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,279
the imei the mz firmware and other

601
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,840
details

602
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,000
one way of discovering the two-way radio

603
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
frequencies in use by a target company

604
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,039
is to discover the handset models in use

605
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,559
different radio models usually have

606
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,720
their own default frequencies which may

607
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,279
not be changed by the users

608
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,120
one particular way of establishing this

609
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,440
is to use tender or contract award

610
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
databases and websites as these may

611
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
reveal the radio supplier and or

612
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,760
security company that the target has

613
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,279
engaged to work with

614
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,679
in the uk bid stats is an example of

615
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,840
such a site and this is freely

616
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,480
accessible the redacted contract award

617
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,080
here shows the supplier which is a

618
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,279
manned security company

619
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,880
another useful source of spreadsheets

620
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
and other databases on public spending

621
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,760
so in this example a security company

622
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
was paid several thousand pounds to

623
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,679
provide stewarding services to an event

624
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,200
being held by the organization listed

625
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
also useful for finding a company

626
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
supplies are the web statistics

627
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,279
functionality that is sometimes on

628
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,200
company websites

629
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,679
such stats show site visitors which may

630
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,760
include suppliers and they're also paid

631
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,000
for site search engine analytics

632
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,120
services

633
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,200
that can show much more detailed site

634
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
backlinks and referrers

635
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,840
so once the radio or security supplier

636
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,159
is found one can look into the likely

637
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,400
radio device models and

638
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,240
from then frequencies in use

639
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,760
i did an assessment of the likely oops

640
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,080
is that right yes sorry i did an

641
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,919
assessment of the likely frequencies

642
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,840
that the man security guards of a big

643
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,240
blue chip organization were using for

644
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,480
their two-way radio communications

645
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
by just talking to them i found out that

646
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
they used analog two-way two-way radios

647
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
at one of their sites and so this would

648
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,440
have been easy to pick up with a scanner

649
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
and at the head office site the security

650
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
guards used a mixture of digital and

651
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,799
analog radios

652
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,400
a search of their suppliers and

653
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
equipment showed that there was a high

654
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,559
probability that hetero radios were in

655
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
use which would have been set on a

656
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
specific set of frequencies

657
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,159
if left of course to the default

658
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,360
settings

659
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,480
images of devices in use can sometimes

660
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
be found on public sources and it's

661
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,320
often useful to get creative with the

662
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,240
search terms in use if a particular

663
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
image is of a poor quality so this

664
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
example shows the x-ray scanner in an

665
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
airport on a military base the first

666
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,080
search term that were used uh x-ray

667
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,240
scanner and the name of the base in

668
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,200
google

669
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,919
um brought up the image on the left

670
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,000
which is pretty blurry

671
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
can't really read or see what what the

672
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,600
make is

673
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,679
however a search for screening device

674
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,000
plus the name of this base shows another

675
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,279
photo

676
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,520
which shows the device make quite

677
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,799
clearly high tracks

678
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,120
so whilst this isn't a typical iot

679
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,520
device it's the basically the same

680
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
principles

681
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,320
another place to pick up open source

682
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,799
data on iot websites are bug bounty

683
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,399
sites which show which allow

684
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
organizations to make freely accessible

685
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,399
details of their servers and

686
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,720
applications and pointers to where they

687
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,559
believe vulnerabilities are

688
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,240
this information can then be used for

689
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
further exploitation obviously this is

690
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,559
not to discourage companies from seeking

691
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,919
help and wanting to improve their

692
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,039
security

693
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,480
but it's to make you aware of how

694
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,399
someone with little scruples could make

695
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,000
use of this data

696
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,840
so in this example we see a well-known

697
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,880
crypto miner development site details

698
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
showing the url that isn't in public

699
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,399
sources

700
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
and a description of possible ways that

701
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,479
they believe it could be exploited

702
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,399
it's possible to pick up quite a bit of

703
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,120
ocean from the d-star dmr and other

704
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,960
common standard gateways and servers

705
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,399
using such sites as

706
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:25,360
d-stargateway.org where you can get

707
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,279
information on the last known crawlers

708
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,720
in their location

709
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,360
very often one sees gateway or server

710
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
owners publicizing in great detail the

711
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
configuration of the hardware with

712
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,080
photos and admin console readily

713
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,720
accessible

714
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,880
likewise the radio id.net database shows

715
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,320
dmr and nxdn users and repeater details

716
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,919
it's easy to forget or not to worry too

717
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,440
much about whether you'll be breaking

718
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,799
the law

719
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,360
owning and using an sdr the laws are

720
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,440
often different in each country or even

721
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
in different jurisdictions within the

722
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,360
same country and the likelihood of

723
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,200
getting caught is very low

724
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,279
here are some general rules however to

725
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,520
abide by if in doubt

726
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,440
don't have a scanner in your car not

727
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,679
just actively working but

728
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,679
just physically in your car switched on

729
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,799
or off

730
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,840
don't use your scanner to transmit

731
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,279
an obvious one but don't use your

732
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
scanner to commit a crime

733
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,080
don't obtain material benefit from your

734
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,760
scanning activities

735
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,520
don't use your scanner to decrypt

736
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
communications

737
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,399
don't scan cellular frequencies

738
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,159
don't possess the scanner if you've been

739
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,159
convicted of a crime in the last five

740
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,159
years some some states in the in the

741
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,480
united states have that as a rule

742
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,240
and finally look into whether you need

743
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
to get a license from your national

744
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,000
communications regulatory body

745
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,159
in the uk the main law of interest is

746
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,559
section 48 of the wireless telegraphy

747
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,480
act and this says there must be no

748
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
intent to obtain or disclose information

749
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
from any private message except where

750
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,240
the information would have come to the

751
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
person's knowledge via non-rf sources

752
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,360
from others so the journalist who shows

753
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,600
up at a site of a burning building to

754
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,159
report on it as a result of hearing

755
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,080
a fire service emergency transmission

756
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,799
virus scanner would be acting illegally

757
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,720
you don't need a license to use a

758
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,240
scanner unless it's capable of

759
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,679
transmission

760
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,919
so in practice it's difficult to police

761
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,240
anyone contravening these laws

762
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,399
ofcom only investigated three event

763
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,520
offenses under this section between 2016

764
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,679
and 2021 so that's an average of one

765
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,919
every 18 months or so

766
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,480
it's a plausible defense to say that

767
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,720
certain frequencies were stumbled on by

768
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,039
accident and the owners therefore should

769
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,799
be on the people transmitting the

770
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,880
confidential transmissions they should

771
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,640
be encrypting or encoding them

772
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,240
the law here states uh varies

773
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,600
considerably between the different

774
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
states in general the fcc and

775
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,320
communications act does not forbid the

776
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,720
interception of overhearing your

777
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,640
neighbor's conversation over a cordless

778
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,200
telephone or listening to emergency

779
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,440
service reports media broadcasts and

780
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,399
transmissions by amateur radio operators

781
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,679
now this bit is interesting it's legal

782
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,519
to intercept communication that is

783
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,240
readily accessible to the general public

784
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,960
this may be open to interpretation

785
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,399
clearly a cordless telephone

786
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,240
conversation is not meant to be heard by

787
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,559
the general public but they can be

788
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,799
readily accessed by the public

789
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,880
emergency services communications in the

790
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,840
uk are encrypted by default as opposed

791
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,279
to in the united states most are

792
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,279
unencrypted by default

793
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,039
some police forces there have made the

794
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,120
deliberate decision to leave their

795
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,760
transmissions unencrypted to enable

796
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
different police forces and emergency

797
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
services in other jurisdictions to be

798
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,039
able to communicate with them

799
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,440
effectively and also provide a level of

800
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,679
accountability to the general public who

801
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,799
may be listening into their

802
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,039
communications

803
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,360
and here it's illegal to manufacture

804
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,320
imports sell or lease equipment that can

805
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,399
intercept or disrupt the cellular

806
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,799
service

807
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,320
many thanks

808
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,840
i hope that was useful
