can y'all still hear me because i'm

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,600
going to be like wandering around a lot

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,359
because it's better if i'm even moving

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,599
targets so the tomatoes don't hit full

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,480
full impact um i'd like to start off

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
it's like i had a conversation i wanted

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,280
to make sure i added this it's like

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,119
someone was talking about how they just

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,080
started

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,960
uh

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,320
working in the community and trying to

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,800
get understand the community here in uh

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,640
dublin and they were like well we need a

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,080
bigger security community it's like it's

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,439
like this is a good place to start and

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,119
it's like and they were already putting

17
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,399
in time as a volunteer so it's like and

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,840
i reminded them it's like well you

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,200
understand that it's like without you

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
creating this community it's like by

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,600
creating this con conference and

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,440
volunteering there would be no reason

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,399
for me to be here it's like so they're

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,239
the actual rock stars it's like i'm not

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,079
a rock star i'm a roadie it's like it's

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,440
like but they're the rock stars that

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,199
actually get this stuff done and get

28
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360

hospitality very appreciative of what

31

they've done so that's community service

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,879
it's like it's one thing to get up on

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,640
stage and have everybody like oh look at

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,400
me if i could talk and stuff it's

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
another thing to do the stuff behind the

36
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
scenes that no one knows and still puts

37
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,720
in that time to make this happen so

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
thank you guys for that thank you for

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,810

[Applause]

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,400
this is a offensive talk here well most

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,640
of my talks are offensive but uh this is

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
the one where i talk about technical

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
stuff so uh i have to have my legal

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
disclaimer i'm not a lawyer uh but i

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
have played one on the internet

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840
successfully uh so

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
uh when i talk about how i'm going to

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,560
try to steal from you or kill you or

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,040
ruin you financially uh

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,280
remember the kittens i'm adorable i

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,119
won't try to steal from you kill you or

53
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
ruin you unless you pay me first there's

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,360
always a contract okay most of the time

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,560
it's like there's always a contract so i

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
changed the title a little bit for the

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,399
talk i hope you don't mind uh but bear

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,640
with me uh the new talk is called

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
perceptions from a blue tractor to a

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,119
blue black blue and black dress because

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,520
it's this whole talk is about perception

62
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
you know it's like how do we perceive

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479
things

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,760
and i think one of the funnest things

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
that we perceived is that we perceived

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
you know tractors you know that's what

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
grows our our vegetables

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,920
but they also take tanks who knew right

69
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,120
it's like

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
i didn't realize that it's like uh i

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
think it's a hilarious fact to find out

72
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
it's also an unfortunate fact to find

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
out but it's still sort of hilarious

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,599
okay it's like so uh that was uh from

75
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,400
there

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
and don't worry i i'm

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,080
i don't have anybody sponsoring me

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,519
there's no way i'm ever getting top

79
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,959
secret clearance or anything like that

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,440
so i say what i freaking want to say

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
it's like so sorry don't at me bro uh

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
this these are just me

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,519
um

84
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,599
the most boring slide in the deck is the

85
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,560
one where you're supposed to like you

86

anything else it's like hopefully the

104
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,280
rest of the stuff will show you why i

105
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,720
was up here talking

106
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,560
um we're going to cover stuff with where

107
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
to go to find information that factors

108
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,480
in to facilitates the attack crafting

109
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,840
the attack to be the most effective

110
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
using humans as the flaw not the

111
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,519
technology and how to defend against

112
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,280
these types of attacks but still conduct

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,319
business

114
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,440
now one of the things is like i'm going

115
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,879
to talk about a lot of real world

116
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,480
engagement things

117
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,640
not online stuff it's like people like

118
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
but i use online to gather some stuff

119
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
for for the physical but we need to

120
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
understand you're almost identical it's

121
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
like we've intertwined it's like people

122
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
think uh when i used to work for a bank

123
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
it's like i used to tell them like

124
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,439
that big shiny

125
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,920
uh metal monstrosity vault thing that

126
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
looks really cool

127
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,560
that's not where the money is who wants

128
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,519
that

129
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,079
it's like the computer terminal is where

130
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,399
your bank vault is that's where i want

131
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,440
to rob

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
it's like if i go into a place and i rob

133
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
them with a shotgun and a ski mask i'm

134
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,120
going to have a bad day you know why

135
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,960
because most of the tellers and people

136
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
are trained for that

137
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,919
i have a hundred percent 100 success

138
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,800
rate

139
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,720
for robbing banks

140
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
because i don't wear a ski mask and

141
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
shotgun

142
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,759
i wear usually a suit or a jacket or i

143
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,360
mean i've worn a defcon leather jacket

144
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
and thundercat tinny shoes one time in

145
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
another country and it's like and did it

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
successfully it's like but i had a

147
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
microsoft badge

148
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,520
or and i'm like using a usb drive not a

149
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,639
shotgun

150
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
so it's perceptions and so we're going

151
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
to go talk more about that and i want to

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
show that first i want to show how i

153
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,360
actually figure this out i uh disclaimer

154
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
i only use i do not use matego

155
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,320
i don't use i do not do advanced okay

156
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
if you want someone up here talking

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
about the zero days they popped or knobs

158
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
that they sled or any of those things

159
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,400
it's not this guy okay

160
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,639
this stuff is so easy even i can do it

161
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,160
we've got to figure out how to look at

162
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,880
the basic stuff you hear about apt all

163
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
the time i mean i already heard someone

164
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,600
say

165
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,360
do you know what apt really stands for

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,160
and

167

i'm not going to credit who i got it

171
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,880
from because i stole it from a guy from

172
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
the fbi at a conference once and it's

173
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,600

182
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
tools or methods i'm usually spending

183
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,440
one hour and 45 minutes to

184
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,600
successfully compromise a financial

185
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
institution in jamaica was the longest

186
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
i've ever taken to to create uh my fish

187
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,000
my pretext was an hour and 45 minutes

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,120
that was like

189
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
if you know how bad my adhd is that was

190
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
a very long time people okay it's like

191
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
that was like

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
and i wasn't even getting to play

193
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,479
usually i like i'll play usually i do it

194
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,400
not playing like warcraft or i'm

195
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
i'm not playing that anymore now but i'm

196
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
playing uh no man's sky or something

197
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
like that but no i had to like actually

198
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
just do that first

199
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,240
hour and 45 minutes but uh and i'll find

200
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
the information and so i use those tools

201
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,479
i use basic tools uh to commit to do

202
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,479
these compromises so i start off with

203
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,599
google

204
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,360
i want to give a i want to give an

205
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
example of how i do it so i like to pick

206
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,319
different targets um and

207
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,039
i i will say i like to preface everybody

208
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,080
that i show that i could have

209
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
potentially compromised and i'll be

210
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
showing videos of someone that i do i

211
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,759
actually have compromised

212
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,479
understand one important thing

213
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,080
i could do it to you

214
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
it's like i can do it you're gonna don't

215
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
don't make fun of these people well even

216
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
why just a little bit but it's like uh

217
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
it's like the new york branch i i tried

218
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,560
to get i tried to get a job with them

219
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
when i was first getting out and because

220
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
i didn't have a college degree they they

221
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,319
totally nixed me i got everything

222
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,840
correct all the technical stuff every

223
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
all the rest interviews went perfect but

224
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,599
i didn't have a piece of paper so i'm

225
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,400
petty uh and uh so i'm using them as my

226
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,759
example uh but the whole thing is it's

227
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,319
like you don't make fun of them because

228
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,639
it could have been just anybody else

229
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
so i'm not one of those red teamers that

230
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
like to be that arrogant infantile toxic

231
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,879
masculinity like punch them in the face

232
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,160
and see if they've got a plan it's

233
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,319
idiotic and infintile and we got to grow

234
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,160
beyond that it's like we're supposed to

235
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
be there as a uh advocate not their

236
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
adversary

237
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
so i wanted to go and i wanted to rob

238
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,599
the maine new york office uh because

239
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,840
they really don't like me because uh

240
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,160
ironically enough five years after uh

241
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
they denied me i went to their extreme

242
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
hacking course and on the first day i

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,039
showed them an ms sql vulnerability that

244
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,039
was internet facing on their on their uh

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,560
on their ip address and they weren't

246
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
pleased

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,599
but so i want to go after the new york

248
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
office because petty and um here we are

249
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,759
and i look at it and now you don't say

250
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,159
this is ernst nunn's headquarters

251
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,279
but this is very important

252
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,080
it says arsene young on the building but

253
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,159
does ernst young actually run that

254
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,000
building

255
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
i mean yeah tony stark had a great

256
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,040
building do you think he was collecting

257
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,800
rent do you think he was making sure the

258
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,480
starbucks was there doing their job no

259
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,040
there's a property management company

260
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
that handles these properties

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
i don't have to attack ernst young

262
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
harness and young is a security-ish

263
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
company it's like you know it's like

264
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
they've got checks and balances there's

265
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
somebody for mercy young i'm sorry i'm

266
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
not going to stop you know slamming on

267
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
you but i'm sorry uh but it's like

268
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
they're like

269
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,040
they're security guards so they're not

270
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
going to have all their stuff out there

271
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
they're going to be way more secure but

272
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,640
their property management company is not

273
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,080
in the business of security and

274
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600

uh oh

303
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,480
oh remember the good old days when you

304
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
had to go into dumpsters and you had

305
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
like a shady guy you had to meet to get

306
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,079
the bank blueprints and stuff you know

307
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,720
from a guy it's like i literally found

308
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,279
bank blueprints in a dumpster once it

309
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,880
was amazing i spent a lot of time in

310
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,399
dumpsters i mean i used to live behind

311
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,920
one when i was homeless but it's like

312
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
yeah it's like i'm familiar with them

313
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
but that was the best score i ever got

314
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,399
was actually the bank blueprints uh it's

315
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,160
like so but we don't have to do that

316
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,320
anymore because we got the internet it's

317

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,040
that's highlighted

331
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,480
it's like you look at the stuff that's

332
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
grayed out

333
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,240
because here's where i'm going to be

334
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
breaking in through the back door to the

335
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,160
storage area it's like i love going

336
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,279
through the freight elevator because

337
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,800
it's like because you know why they've

338
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
got guards here they're scary

339
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,120
they're making sure people coming in

340
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,680
they're checking they're like whoa

341
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
hold up dude i'm just trying to rob you

342
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
back off a little bit you know it's like

343
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,000
no i don't like going through here i

344
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,920
come in here with a package and trust me

345
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,640
i've

346
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
too many times if i just run yeah i'm

347
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
doing a delivery upstairs okay cool

348
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,079
thank you i'll be in it's like that's

349
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
what i like i like that way better but

350
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,839
what happens when i get up there now i'm

351
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,920
like where'd i go

352
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
perception

353
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,040
that's the whole thing that runs through

354
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
this whole thing is perception

355
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,680
because i need to know as much as i can

356
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,560
about the floor plans of a building

357
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,839
so i can walk naturally when someone

358
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
questions me i can say i'm going to the

359
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,360
electoral closet right down there to the

360
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,600
right by the bathroom

361
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,639
boom

362
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,880
i'm trusted because i knew exactly where

363
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
it was how could i know that

364
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,279
it's like i go to architects websites

365
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,120
because they'll showcase when you do new

366
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
uh renovations or when you have a

367
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
certain architect that will do your your

368
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
office space i have rob people because

369
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
of those it's like because i've been

370
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
able to see their where their things are

371
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,120
located and how to get in and bypass the

372
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,959
receptionist from the architect's

373
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,079
website

374
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,920
it's like i don't have to do that here

375
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,160
because you know there's the floor plans

376
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
uh for all the different kinds of floors

377
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,800
they have

378
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,360
and once again what am i looking at

379
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,600
oh they really don't want you to see

380
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,880
this

381
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,079
why

382
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,000
it's like i don't know

383
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
uh oh because it shows you where the

384
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,160
elevator where the electrical calls it

385
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,079
where all the other devices are more

386
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,519
importantly not only to show you where

387
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,040
the mail room is

388
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,920
because let's face it because it's

389
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,760
probably the mail room right here it

390
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,320
shows you where it goes out of

391
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,480
so it shows you exactly where to turn or

392
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,760
which way to go to make it look like

393
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,200
you're actually going through do you

394
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,399
know you how to get do you know how to

395
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,600
get out of freight elevators because

396
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
usually front elevators people will tell

397
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,720
me but jason don't they have like those

398
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,240
little dead man locks where it's like

399
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
you can't you know get in it's like yeah

400
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,519
most of them that's where cell phones

401
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,800
come in

402
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,680
i spent 15 minutes in boston

403
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
and the freight elevator like this

404
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,519
now literally was talking to someone at

405
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,880
some point and then i talked to another

406
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,079
person and no one wants to talk to me

407
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,839
anymore so i was just like hanging it's

408
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,000
like and then someone comes up the

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,720
freight elevator and then i just go oh

410
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
wait hold on hold on a second no you

411
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,680
don't have to get me don't don't worry

412
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,199
someone just showed up they'll let me in

413
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,199
i'll meet you in your office uh things

414
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,360
sorry to bother you it's like thank you

415
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,040
and they let me in

416
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
or it's even better

417
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,959
i i don't know about all fire codes but

418
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,160
like in america the fire codes are very

419
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,600
simple there has to be a motion sensor

420
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,880
on the uh inside part of the door

421
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
so even if it's secured lock on the

422
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
outside

423
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,839
people can just go by and the motion

424
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,399
sensor triggers

425
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,320
but what happens when people are just

426
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,000
walking by it

427
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,240
it still triggers

428
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
so you just listen really good

429
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
it's like and you wait to hear that

430
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,639
little click

431
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,240
and you walk in

432
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
just like you're supposed to be there

433
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,839
uh this was still hard to see i didn't

434
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
like that one uh oops oops

435
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
oops oops there we go

436
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,600
it's like very little bitty buttons on

437
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
this thing okay uh

438
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,839
there's the uncensored version

439
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,760
that's much easier to see right i

440
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,079
appreciate that it's like um

441
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,760
and i want another thing that i wanted

442
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
to do is show you

443
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,480
i don't use uh my parents basement it's

444
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,839
like uh i don't talk to them but it's

445
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:58,959
like they don't also don't have a

446
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,240
basement so darn it's like uh i i would

447
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
be trust me a hundred percent if my

448
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,639
house had a basement i would be in that

449
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,040
basement with no shame whatsoever those

450
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
are cool it's like uh no i was at the

451
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,399
panera bread robbing them uh eating

452
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,639
pizza and diet pepsi

453
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,240
that's how easy it the reason why i

454
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
showed that

455
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
is because

456
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
i'm usually in your lobby at your

457
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,160
starbucks or your local caffeine cafe

458
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,240
doing the same thing

459
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,320
it's like doing that oh well i mean not

460
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
just doing that usually if i'm at your

461
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
location i'm also you know running a

462
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,759
wi-fi pineapple and doing a wi-fi scan

463
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,279
and compromising your employees as

464
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,639
they're coming in and out

465
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,680
at the same time i'm keeping recon of

466
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
what kind of people are going in at what

467
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,480
time what the security looks like it's

468
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,360
like and what the dress is of that uh

469
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
that location so when i do come in to

470
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,519
actually attack them i will be more

471
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,040
dressed in that way and i'll blend in

472
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,519
more well i mean honestly i i don't try

473
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,199
to blend in too much it's like i will be

474
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,480
robbing somebody with a shirt on

475
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,279
eventually at some point it's like so uh

476
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
i don't i don't try to blend in it's

477
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
like but because i like to come with

478
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,639
warning labels it's like uh because i'm

479
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
doing security awareness engagements i'm

480
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
not trying to do a red team engagement

481
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
uh there is a big difference

482
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,880
uh and there's just a close-up it's like

483
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,639
uh of the device for some reason i don't

484
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,680
know why i put that in there why did i

485
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,279
put that in there

486
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,800
i guess because i want to see a close-up

487
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,240
of the thing it's like i'm glad y'all

488
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
asked

489
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,399
also i'm going to social media

490
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,120
it's like uh if you want to know why

491
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
information security people drink

492
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,079

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,160
i mean i don't drink alcohol and it's

495
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,000
it's been pretty close sometimes it's

496
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,959
like

497
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,639
oh

498
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,199
this is why people want whiskey okay now

499
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,759
i understand cause it gets depressing

500
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,120
and jeff i have been able to

501
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
uh on one engagement within less than an

502
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,079
hour or two no it was less than an hour

503
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,040
it's like because i was going through

504
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,399
this one other step before i did that

505
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,199
step but it's like get an employee badge

506
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,880
from the company i was specifically

507
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,839
robbing

508
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,280
and printed out

509
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,240
it's like uh to use on an engagement uh

510
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
also uh what i love too is on instagram

511
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,919
you there's certain geo locations

512
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
your headquarters usually have a geotag

513
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,760
location

514
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
that's awesome

515
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,480
then i can just go to your location tag

516
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,079
on uh instagram and i can see everyone

517
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,559
that is what are the odds some of your

518
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,039
employees have tagged where they work

519
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,000
high

520
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,799
it's very high okay it's like uh like

521
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,200
these uh poor individuals uh that have

522
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,160
done it it's like um with this guy if

523
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
i've dug deeper i can show you the whole

524
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,880
trail of this guy it's like uh he's very

525
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,960
social uh which is the best type of

526
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
people to compromise uh and so uh also

527
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,280
if you go on twitter

528
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,600
you do uh search for hashtag new badge

529
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,520
you'll get the same thing but you're

530
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
also asking the question like but jason

531
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,200
how do i

532
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,679
print these badges out what kind of

533
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,600
advanced alien technologies like that

534
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
just instantly do that within a it's

535
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,120
like you got to go into work and try to

536
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,799
like say that you're you're you're in a

537
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,280
new employee to get one of their badges

538
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,678
that's where the badgi 100 comes in

539
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
the only way this device could be cooler

540
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
people if it was the badgi 3000 okay

541
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,520
they really missed an opportunity there

542
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,080
okay so the badgi 100 it's only

543
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,880
649 u.s so that's what 120 euros or

544
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
something i don't know it's like but

545
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,039
yeah it's like right there you can get

546
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,080
the badgi 100 and print out your own

547
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,679
employee badge

548
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,720
it's like

549
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,400
does it have to be rfid no

550
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,440
i've

551
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,799
i've got batch cloners i've got uh this

552
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
really cool boss cloner that's like

553
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,520
three feet away you can scan your badges

554
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,559
why

555
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,120
that's so much work

556
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
i'm a hacker i'm trying to be lazy here

557
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,559
people it's like i'm you you you spend

558
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,480
an hour so you don't have to do a

559
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
10-minute job right i mean that's that's

560
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,000
how it works

561
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
so it's like you know i just i just want

562
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
something that makes it look like i'm

563
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,080
supposed to be there i've literally gone

564
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,160
to security

565
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
oh it's not working

566
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
say it's not even

567
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,639
and they'll buzz me in

568
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,840
so

569
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,080
once again i gotta remind you i gotta

570
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
remind you

571
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
one of the people in this video

572
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
did everything almost perfectly the

573
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,399
right way

574
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,600
but

575
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,160
there was one miscommunication

576
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
and i used that

577
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,480
to fully compromise the bank

578
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
and what i mean by fully compromised the

579
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,799
bank i mean i compromised every single

580
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,640
machine including the data center in the

581
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,000
bank

582
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
and it's like and i tell a lot of

583
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,720
stories and when i was getting this talk

584
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640

585
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,880
stories uh throughout the years and

586

589
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,159

okay that pauses i'm

640
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,640

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,520
on this he's like that's what i'm going

642
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,918
to say yeah

643
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,760
here we go

644
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,280
but watch how she approaches me

645
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
she's directly questioning me like she

646
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,200
should have doing the usb audit

647
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960

you log in real quick

649
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,720
why

650
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,960
it is the intent i'm not showing you

651
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,840
this

652
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,360
but okay i'm gonna start what i'm gonna

653
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,159
say

654
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,200
anyway what i did was did you notice as

655
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
soon as i was challenged

656
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
i did not stop

657
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
because i belong there

658
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,919
i made sure the perception was oh i'm

659
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,760
doing my job it's like you can question

head office was supposed to contact you

678
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,639
head office didn't contact you

679
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
no problem

680
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
no i actually y'all saw me i pushed the

681
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,760
pause button

682
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,880
microsoft okay um

683
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
but when do you see what i did

684
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,200
she did what was right

685
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
what did she do

686
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
she's like i don't know anything about

687
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
that i don't know what you're supposed

688
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,000
to be doing

689
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
it's like you need to talk to the head

690
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
manager

691
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,520
a hundred percent correct

692
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,840
it's like i was i literally

693
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,360
you don't understand how much i love it

694
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,039
when i get caught

695
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,520
it's like that's my job

696
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
is to make sure that they understand

697
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,080
that they're doing the right thing to

698
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,039
help show them and and show that

699
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,440
it's like if i go back the year the next

700
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
year and i don't get caught or i don't

701
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,960
get uh if i'm not if i'm more successful

702
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,360
than i was before i failed

703
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,039
it's like that's not a good thing

704
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,440
okay here we go

705
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,559
i think it's gonna work this time

706
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,080
now it pauses mother okay

707
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,960
this is just

708
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,919
true no problem that sounds great

709
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,080
and i'm all natural about it sure

710
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
i'm not gonna pause screw it we'll just

711
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,880
keep talking over here

712
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,559
but look what you got this is the one

713
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,799
mistake this was the fatal flaw

714
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,000
uh

715
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
i'll stand by can't wait to pick me okay

716
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,960
see i say i'll stand by with me i did a

717
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
crosstalk attack

718
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,960
i may

719
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
told her to go away so the manager

720
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,919
thinks that she vetted me yes she thinks

721
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,159
the manager is going to vet me no one

722
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,640
vetted me that is a crosstalk attack

723
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,240
i've done that i broke it into high

724
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,720
secure facilities that i cannot have you

725
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
know say publicly awesome

726
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,880
using that attack

727
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,320
can i go to can you get me behind the

728
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,840
teller line why not

729
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,840
and do you have a network server here

730
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
too why not everything

731
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,039
oh can you show me that first

732
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,640
let's jump in the data center first just

733
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
to make sure i get that before i get

734
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,120
found out you know

735
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
that's my trusted agent the guy who's

736
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,720
with the employer that uh you know

737
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,960
verify that i'm when if i do get caught

738
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
or or someone pulls a gun on me uh this

739
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,480
hasn't happened which is good um

740

usually they'll be there to help me out

741
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,760
so he walked me up to the data center

742
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,880
this is being recorded on a button cam

743
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,480

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,559
i could get in there and trust me with

769

you

838
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,520
how the did that just happen

839
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,240
i honestly did not know it was like i've

840
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,760
done some branches like that but that

841
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,320
was like one of the most successful ones

842
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,279
i've done

843
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,840
it's like but it was a matter of

844
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,159
perception

845
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,080
i have robbed other banks like that too

846
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,000
where i would go and walk in a certain

847
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,399
area like i knew where i was going wait

848
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,080
a certain moment come back from a

849
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,279
different direction or like they thought

850
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,600
i was talking to the bank manager

851
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,880
and then i would come in and say not

852
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,840
from the headquarters and they would

853
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,159
have by the time the bank manager finds

854
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,559
me i'm behind the teller line so

855
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,000
therefore i must have been vetted by one

856
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,840
of the employees and i've got full

857
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,559
access still

858
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,039
this is the best video thank goodness

859
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,399
it's not that long so i shouldn't keep

860
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,720
pausing it it's like we'll show you what

861
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,360
i mean by perception it's not

862
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
where you look for warning labels it's

863
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,720
how our mind acts and our mind reacts

864
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,880
through certain patterns

865
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,799
so this

866
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,159
is me robbing a bank uh another uh bank

867
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,399
branch on this engagement

868
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,080
notice i come in from the public's

869
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,919
facing side so therefore i'm definitely

870
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,320
a danger but look where i stopped

871
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,720
i stopped here behind this column in

872
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,399
front of that so it appears that i was

873
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,600
talking to the lady who was on her phone

874
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,360
and then i come from a safe direction

875
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
then i come from her death and i just

876
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,840
walk in casually

877
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,600
i'm now coming from a trusted side

878
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,080
the tellers don't think in their brains

879
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,840
like consciously

880
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,960
this site is safe this site is dangerous

881
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,480
but you do

882
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
it is human nature

883
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,120
that's what i'm exploiting

884
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
it's like i'm i'm exploiting human

885
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,200
nature it's like they know that that

886
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,960
side was trusted that employees and

887
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,519
stuff come from that direction

888
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,519
if i was coming straight from the public

889
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,760
side i would have been questioned

890
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,360
they would have felt i mean i looked

891
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,720
sketchy af they would have said

892
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
something

893
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,080
but i came from a trusted location

894
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,760
here's me uh

895
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,360
oh this is you it doesn't matter i'm

896
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
just uh talking and and robbing them

897
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,440
it's like uh well i also got board cuz

898
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
trying to wait for this lady so i just

899
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,519
span around in the chair uh

900
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,679
it's like and she says i have a lot of

901
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,039
work and i'm like oh yeah i know just

902
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,240
hold on to me

903
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,159
you know i know you're busy sorry but i

904
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,440
gotta still rob you uh

905
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,279
is it the same organization

906
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,200
huh

907
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,440
yes

908
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,320
which is important because i guarantee

909
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,039
you and also on the same engagements

910
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,640
like uh um

911
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,159
when they showed the show oh it doesn't

912
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,760
be compromising the person that was on

913
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,360
their phone it's like because now i'm

914
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,039
coming from the teller area i'm coming

915
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,880
from the safe area they let me

916
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,039
compromise them as well uh i did this

917
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
for the uh the national geographic show

918
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,840
and i will tell you right now it's like

919
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,440
when you look at this and you see these

920
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,039
kind of things you're like why would

921
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,120
they let you do that because they're not

922
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,720
trained

923
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,679
i guarantee you if i come back the next

924
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,519
day or i come back the next week and

925
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,360
i've come back on everyone they will

926
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,720
know better

927
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,640
because they will realize or someone and

928
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,919
they don't have to look like me just a

929
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,519
different because now they know

930
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,000
now they know not to ask ask someone

931
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,880
it's like if someone's going to try to

932
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,039
plug a device in they know they have to

933
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,640
get an email or get some kind of

934
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,039
confirmation from security

935
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,640
it's like oh

936
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
since i got five minutes oh i'm gonna be

937
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,159
much longer than that it's like i'm the

938
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,559
last guy and it's like it's like and if

939
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,480
y'all leave i'm not offended don't worry

940
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,320
it's like but i i'll be done

941
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,719
um it's like so once again it's the

942
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,040
perceiving of the threat external versus

943
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,960
internal yeah that's more like it it's

944
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,079
like so

945
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,719
um so it goes again i'm not attacking

946
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,159
your network with technology in zero

947
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,599
days to get in i'm fighting your people

948
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,359
using your perceptions and expectations

949
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,040
against them

950
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,359
it's just our basic perceptions of what

951
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,839
is safe and what is not

952
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,000
um you know we're all familiar with the

953
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,960
you know

954
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,280
this crazy internet sensation it was a

955
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
while back ago you know it was before

956
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,119
even tick tock uh so it's like you may

957
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,440
not be uh familiar with that but uh this

958
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,480
was the whole uh uh white and uh was it

959
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,879
blue and black white or gold dress uh

960
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,800
phenomenon i wanted to update it a

961
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
little bit so i did another one on

962
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,040
perception

963
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,960
this is the thing about perception

964
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
because remember back in the old days

965
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,839
look at this clown look at this idiot

966
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,920
dancing with the stars mr all prissy

967
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,480
makeup comedian dude what a joke right

968
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,800
and look at this buff rugged i don't

969
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,599
need mosquitoes bounce off my chest you

970
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,680
know it's like while i'm hunting or

971
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,079
horseback riding because that's you know

972
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,200
weird uh and um and also it's like oh

973
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,440
there's my pet leopard this is the guy

974
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,359
who wants to go after the lgbtq

975
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,599
community by the way it's like

976
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,440
okay project much but um so the uh the

977
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,280
whole point here is look at all that

978
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,920
masculine virility right

979
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,520
i swoon him right

980
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,640
but now we understand perception is one

981
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,440
thing

982
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,000
actuality is another

983
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,640
because look at this clown he should

984
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,000
have been on dancing with the stars

985
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,640
instead of trying to to do an invasion

986
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,800
it's like look at him okay i mean look

987
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
at this it's like these are all recent

988
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
photos i mean i would almost feel sad

989
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,760
for him if he had a soul but uh and then

990
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,520
you look over at this guy

991
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,240
mother that's the thing i would not make

992
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,079
fun of this guy's jokes or walk out of

993
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,680
his act okay i will tell you that right

994
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,880
now

995
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,000
i mean

996
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,359
this guy his advisors are over here

997
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,560
these guys you don't want to meet the

998
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,800
dark alley those are his i mean i've

999
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,480
literally had the instinctual retake

1000
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,160
like i wanted to give my lunch money

1001
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,599
it's like it was it was just like

1002
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,760
instinctual it's like so that's that's

1003
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,320
what that is that's perception

1004
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
what you usually see

1005
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,359
can be totally different than what is

1006
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,560
i'm a very dangerous person

1007
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,599
it's like but i try to be very adorable

1008
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,680
it's like so you don't understand that

1009
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,599
you don't see that

1010
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,400
oh also that um

1011
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,040
here's another thing about perception

1012
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,720
it's about putting people at ease

1013
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,640
without them detecting that's what

1014
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,160
you're doing

1015
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,320
notice two things about these these are

1016
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
taking a day apart

1017
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,200
these two photos but what is one thing

1018
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,640
in common it's effing cold outside

1019
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,400
it is below zero celsius outside and i'm

1020
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,880
not wearing a jacket

1021
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,560
or winter gear

1022
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,400
it's not because i'm like i am an idiot

1023
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,680
but it's not because i've been doing it

1024
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,839
for this one okay

1025
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,960
because once i successfully break into

1026
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,800
the company

1027
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,599
i can't be wearing an outside jacket

1028
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,200
because that shows that i'm from the

1029
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,880
outside

1030
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,960
that shows i don't have a place to put

1031
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,560
my jacket

1032
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,640
that shows i don't have a place to set

1033
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,920
up

1034
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,280
but if i'm inside your location they

1035
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,040
gotta love the proxima 3 scanner right

1036
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,680
there it's like but it's like i'm if i'm

1037
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,599
inside your facility in the winter

1038
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,520
and i don't have a jacket on well then

1039
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
obviously i've already sat down at my

1040
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,200
office or at my desk or in the

1041
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,359
conference room and i've i've already

1042
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,560
got a place to store my gear

1043
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,599
human perception that's it that was no

1044
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,320
lee o'day attack that was just using

1045
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
people's perceptions against them

1046
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,280
also on the first day of recon

1047
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,440
i'm dressing up as a worker i got to go

1048
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,599
tea i don't have gel in my hair it's

1049
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,240
like i'm looking different

1050
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,960
but then i show up the next day

1051
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,359
the goatee shaved it's like i've got gel

1052
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,240
in my hair it's like i'm dressed nicer

1053
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,800
what does that do to people if they saw

1054
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,720
me the day before

1055
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,480
it makes them go

1056
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,880
oh he looks familiar

1057
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,240
i must have run into him before

1058
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
back in the day

1059
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,839
and it makes me

1060
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,359
more trusted

1061
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,119
when i'm robbing them

1062
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,640
which is you know

1063
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,280
the whole point is me to rob them i'm to

1064
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,320
teach them

1065
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,960
you know via robbing um i just like

1066
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
saying robbie but okay and here's some

1067
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,480
of the attacks these are the three

1068
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,079
different attacks that i do

1069
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,520
i do the

1070
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,320
passive role that's usually my favorite

1071
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,800
uh the assertive role uh when i get to

1072
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,200
look like a stock broke a stock broker

1073
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,119
or a person with no soul fight wait

1074
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,280
that's the same thing uh stock broker or

1075
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,440
an executive or auditor kind of person

1076
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,079
uh or that's my like what the let's see

1077
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,920
if it works uh and those are those are

1078
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,640
some fun ones um because all three of

1079
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
those i was doing attacks

1080
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,079
it's like uh i love getting a prox art a

1081
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,200
approximate scanner or getting a wi-fi

1082
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,040
device that will do some compromises and

1083
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,520
drops uh you just tape it to the back of

1084
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
the cardboard sign because who looks at

1085
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,000
the homeless people right it's like uh

1086
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,040
we don't want to acknowledge them

1087
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,320
because then we have to acknowledge we

1088
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,760
know the problems with our society so

1089
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,359
it's like we can just go right past them

1090
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,520
it's like uh it's like he gets way too

1091
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,079
political sorry i rant um and there we

1092
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,000
go so let's start with layer two

1093
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
assertive role assertive worlds do not

1094
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,280
mean aggressive okay what mannerisms and

1095
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,040
pretexts are involved are usually going

1096
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,440
to be i'm in an authoritative role i'm

1097
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
here to audit your network uh there's a

1098
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,280
big acquisition coming up it's like

1099
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
because usually there is because i was

1100
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,599
able to research that and figure out

1101
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,280
there was i'm here to do an audit to

1102
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,040
make sure everything's working right uh

1103
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,400
we had a problem with one of our

1104
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,720
locations it's like i'm here to do a usb

1105
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,920
to make sure the gpu policies are

1106
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
working properly it's like i've

1107
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,680
literally in europe it's i usually want

1108
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,040
because it's like sometimes you guys

1109
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,319
have to be a little more assertive it's

1110
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,599
like i'm here for the surprise

1111
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,000
inspection and it's like i can't get in

1112
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
what part of surprise inspection do you

1113
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,560
not understand

1114
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,319
i don't even want to be here right now

1115
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,079
let me into the server room or i'm

1116
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,000
putting you on the report as well

1117
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,680
i don't have time for this

1118
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,599
i mean surprise inspection

1119
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,040
thank you

1120
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,560
i still put them on the report but you

1121
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,640
know it's like a different way so

1122
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,119
hardware can be used used to be limited

1123
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,560
but more discrete the better your

1124
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
chances are to success because you want

1125
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,160
to use like a usb drive you want to use

1126
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,079
something small that's not going to

1127
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,960
outfit of a guy in a suit or a person

1128
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
that's looking all professional looking

1129
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,480
uh this is the way i usually look in

1130
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,160
assertive roles i tell people um this is

1131
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,640
i tell people if you make me wear a tie

1132
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,520
i will utterly destroy you okay

1133
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,280
not because you're paying extra because

1134
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,960
i hate wearing ties that much i want to

1135
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,359
make sure you regret it um it's like

1136
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,319
this is a custom suit that i got made in

1137
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,560
uh beijing it's like uh it's my business

1138
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
to the doom uh it's like the one one of

1139
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,680
the worst things about not being able to

1140
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,040
go to china right now is i can't uh uh

1141
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,160
go to my uh taylor it's like uh but when

1142
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,079
i first asked when he at first told him

1143
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,160
what i wanted for this suit

1144
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,680
his first words out of his mouth were

1145
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,839
are you a

1146
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,160
magician and i'm like no

1147
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
how could i be a magician you guys you

1148
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,839
know magicians always say there's

1149
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,760
nothing up my sleeve

1150
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,359
and i told them specifically to make

1151
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,520

i made sure all my shirts were custom

1177
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,079

a usb wireless adapter

1185
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,920
uh that turns your desktop into a

1186
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,000
wireless access point for me and a

1187
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,760
gateway into your network from the

1188
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,000
parking lot uh and the other one is a

1189
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
two gig usb drive

1190
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,359
it's like don't worry i'm not going to

1191
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,119
steal any of your data and copy it onto

1192
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,240
the usb drive because you got all those

1193
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,720
right policies very nice stuff it's like

1194
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,920
i'm just going to use the command

1195
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,839
control software that i have on there

1196
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,319
and also has the wireless drivers for

1197
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,200
mac linux and windows so i can install

1198
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,440
the wireless drivers so i can compromise

1199
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,880
you uh so that's fun

1200
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,520
uh here are some of the other devices

1201
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,680
if you think this is overkill you are

1202
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,800
correct

1203
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,000
if you think i'm flexing you are correct

1204
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,440
uh it's like how many of all these guys

1205
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,960
have you used and then actually

1206
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,839
i've used that one

1207
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,680
and

1208
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,720
uh

1209
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,800
i used that one

1210
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,960
and

1211
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,160
uh

1212
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,280
crap

1213
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,760
um

1214
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,160
i think it was a pineapple oh that one

1215
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,280
so that's it

1216
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,640
those are it

1217
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,400
those are the devices

1218
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,920
but it looks cool and intimidating

1219
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,040
doesn't it

1220
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,640
i could if i wanted to use all those but

1221
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,319
i'm not a big blowhard like other people

1222
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,200
who try to threaten you with a whole

1223
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,480
bunch of stuff they have

1224
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,200
but they're not going to use so um

1225
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,800
yeah that's bad

1226
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,319
so let's go to the next player passive

1227
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,200

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,839
several companies my favorite one was in

1253
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,400
new york uh right across the uh cycling

1260
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,119
like uh it says hackaron and i rob

1261
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,520
places uh with that all the time

1262
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,760
it's great uh one manager actually came

1263
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,000
in after me uh

1264
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,160
when i was in the server room for about

1265
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,359
20 minutes because the employee

1266
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,880
mentioned it's like yeah he's from some

1267
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,720
company called hacker it said hacker on

1268
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,760
it and then

1269
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,119
what

1270
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,359
and then i talked to him and and assured

1271
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,839
them and it was okay um

1272
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,800
so

1273
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,119
this is the uh the tool mechanism i'm

1274

it's got pockets

1279
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
ladies you with me i think one of the

1280
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,440
worst things in modern society right now

1281
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,119
is women can have pockets and men can't

1282
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,280
wear purses it's like people ask what i

1283
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,119
call that my man purse effort you know

1284
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,280

1285
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,680
like so uh so yes it's like it's got

1286
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,359

bash money some other devices in there

1288
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,319
but

1289
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,119
this is some of the scariest

1290
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,640
scariest

1291
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,680
devices that i used to compromise at

1292
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,520
almost 100 success rate okay not the omg

1293

1320
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,240

1321
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,480
definitive layers i like to be an ogre i

1322
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,440
have layers so it's like i love layers

1323
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,000
this is what's inside there uh here's a

1324
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,839
whole bunch of really scary things i am

1325

here this is the screen crab

1328
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,400
it's like you just plug into hdmi into

1329
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
one side and you plug in the hdmi back

1330
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,240
into the monitor and now you're

1331
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,319
recording everything on the monitor

1332
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,359
how many executives have those high-end

1333
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,800
hdmi monitors

1334
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,559

from me i love it it's like so uh that's

1336
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,040
really nice so those are some of the

1337
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,359
devices that you can use

1338
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,720
uh the last layer is the omg rolls uh

1339
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,200
should not be your first choice trust me

1340
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,599
um one banner is a prediction

1341
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,319

1342
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,480
financial place as an executive tv

in pajama bottoms it's like in a t-shirt

1347
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,079
i've literally walked into the lobby of

1348
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,079
of the hotel around two o'clock in the

1349
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,040
morning go to the lobby bathroom it's

1350
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,720
like stay there for about an hour and a

1351
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,319
half and trust me that is not a fun

1352
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,960
experience it's like especially at 2 30

1353
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,000
in the morning

1354
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,640
it's like and then i wait then i take my

1355
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,520
pants off i take my top shirt off it's

1356
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,920
like my shoes and my socks roll them all

1357
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
up stick them under the uh the counter

1358
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,119
the the sink counter and i walk out and

1359
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,520
now i'm a hotel guest

1360
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,240
it's like that works out very well too

1361
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,040
um it's like so that one it's like yeah

1362
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,280
hardware used to fit the situation also

1363
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,520
will likely need to be easy to hide it's

1364
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,040
like i usually wear like swim trunks

1365
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,480
underneath the pajama bottoms because i

1366
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,000
gotta have it's like i have to have some

1367
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,480
place to put all these things uh and so

1368
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,800
uh but usually it's just like either my

1369
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,599
my phone so i can call for help and a

1370
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,319
usb uh uh was an old time it was rubber

1371
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,599
ducky now it's just a bash bunny too

1372
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,200
it's like much cooler uh or an omg cable

1373
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
uh this is what i i wear

1374
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,240
uh this is me robbing a very luxurious

1375
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,960
where i can't even say um hotel in the

1376
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,480
south of france teenage mutant ninja

1377
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,839
turtle jama bottoms uh barefoot uh

1378
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:02,640
this

1379
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,559
view

1380
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,119
was the cheap hotel

1381
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,960
they had to put me in

1382
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,280
because they couldn't afford to keep me

1383
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,800
in the hotel the whole entire time for

1384
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,160
the pin test

1385
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,760
it's like they could only afford one

1386
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,160
night in the nice hotel and then they

1387
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,640
put me in this little rinky dink shed uh

1388
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,559
for the rest of it i actually like this

1389
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,839
one better because it's like i like the

1390
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,839
view but uh but that's what you do so

1391
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,520
what you're usually doing is carrying a

1392
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,319
pin

1393
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,200
uh or or a rubber ducky to commit uh

1394
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,119
commit attacks that way

1395
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,400
and we're gonna finish it off with you

1396
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,599
gotta remember

1397
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,880
if i do find a way in and i usually do i

1398
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,599
mean very clearly these are both using

1399
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,680
controls that i was told

1400
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,839
were okay

1401
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,720
this was on the seventh floor of necosia

1402
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,559
cypress office building of the financial

1403
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,839
institution because the cameras

1404
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,599
right there in the elevator lobby did

1405
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,920
not cover this window right here

1406
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,839
and also there was another window right

1407
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,839
over there another camera over there and

1408
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,720
it did not cover the server room

1409
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,400
that had only had a

1410
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,520
drywall with glass windows on that but

1411
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,720
no one would be able to get in without

1412
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,559
being detected they said

1413
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,040
because what idiot would climb out that

1414
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,520
window with a seven-story drop and go

1415
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,760
around the column into the railing and

1416
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,839
then climb up the vent to get to there

1417
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,599
have you met me

1418
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,480
okay

1419
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,720
it's like and the best part about it was

1420
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,720
the guy who told me i couldn't do it i

1421
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,559
told him there was a camera in my pocket

1422
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,920
and i made him take the picture of it

1423
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,680
because i had my jacket it's like he had

1424
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,000
to hold my jacket so that was fun

1425
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,800
petty um so there we go

1426
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,520
so then make sure your employees know

1427
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,000
how to respond once i'm there because

1428
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,680
i'm leisure i guess here's a better

1429
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,240
picture of your company's computer guy

1430
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,480
this picture

1431
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,520
is from my greatest accomplishment

1432
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,480
in my whole entire career

1433
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,960
it is the one that i'm most proud of

1434
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,240
everybody talks about accidentally

1435
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,839
robbing the wrong bank in beirut and

1436
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,160
stuff you know it's like whatever that

1437
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,000
was a failure on my part that was a

1438
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,400
mistake that i did i mean it was cool

1439
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,839
because i lived it's like but it was not

1440
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,680
planned

1441
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,319
i was hired the year before

1442
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,400
to break into this company

1443
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,079
i destroyed them

1444
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,680
i was the worst thing that happened to

1445
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,520
them in such a long time that no one had

1446
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,599
ever gotten in and all the pins i had no

1447
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,760
one ever made it inside and up the

1448
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,079
elevator it's like and gotten into their

1449
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,720
office the guy who hired me family with

1450
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,720
one of his employees badges sitting at

1451
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,559
his desk when he came back from his uh

1452
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,839
conference meeting

1453
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,240
it's like going hi were you expecting me

1454
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,400
it's like so that was bad

1455
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,960
it's like the next year

1456
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,400
and during that year afterwards the ceo

1457
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,240
at their all hands employee meeting

1458
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,400
made sure to spend at least 10 minutes

1459
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,960
talking about the importance of security

1460
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,040
awareness of computer security

1461
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,960
he made sure that they took that to

1462
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,640
heart

1463
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,440
they took the things that i said

1464
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,839
i go back the next year

1465
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,880
looking different than i did before

1466
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,440
there was a new receptionist

1467
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,000

1468

1471
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,200

1472
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,720
she wrote it down then i had to go to

1473
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,839
the restroom i always have to go to the

1474
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,040
restroom right the beginning of the game

1475
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,800
i'll also drink too much pepsi but but

1476
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
in engagement i get lost when going to

1477
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,480
the restroom so i always say i gotta go

1478
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,200
to the restroom she lets me in

1479
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,960
instead of going left to the men's room

1480
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,720
i go right down the corridor compromise

1481
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,839
two machines already a lady is getting

1482
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,920
up out of her desk to see why i'm over

1483
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,200
there

1484
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,000
it's like yes i compromised him already

1485
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,760
the receptors had already talked to the

1486
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,160
guy who was meeting me

1487
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,760
to let him know because there was a

1488
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,520
camera that she was watching and she

1489
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,960
noticed that i turned left instead of

1490
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,200
right

1491
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,119
every

1492
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,359
section of that company

1493
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:12,640
two floors

1494
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,880
different departments every department

1495
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,960
that i went into

1496
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,280
i was able to pone someone i was able to

1497
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,400
compromise

1498
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,520
but

1499
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,400
at every department i was caught

1500
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,000
every

1501
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,520
department

1502
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,319
someone caught me

1503
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,640
that's amazing

1504
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,040
and that shows that you're doing a good

1505
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,040
job

1506
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,400
that shows

1507
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,960
that you worked and you did it

1508
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,480
i loved it

1509
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,720
it's like because they learned and they

1510
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,000
questioned

1511
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,200
and they didn't just let me do it

1512
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,960
willy-nilly

1513
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,799
it's like that's the first time i used

1514
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,480
willy nilly in a long time it's like but

1515
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,640
that that is literally what you're

1516
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,240
supposed to strive for is to have your

1517
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,000
employees do that i am not doing a test

1518
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,760
that they fail

1519
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,280
i'm doing a lesson so they learn

1520
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,960
and that's what we have to make sure our

1521
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,960
employees understand

1522
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,000
they're not being tested for failure

1523
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,559
they're being taught to learn

1524
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,480
to do better

1525
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,559
and to me that is what's important that

1526
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,760
we're missing a lot in these engagements

1527
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,839
so how do we teach them

1528
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,920
you don't just warn your employees show

1529
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,240
them i've got some old youtube videos

1530
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,520
out there and others on how these

1531
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,119
attacks occur not in theory but show

1532
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,480
them real world examples but not just me

1533
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,000
there's plenty of people a lot more

1534
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,760
talented than i am and can do a lot more

1535
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,280
scarier things

1536
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,760
let your employees see that

1537
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,240
because they're watching these you know

1538
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,720
infographic six months every six months

1539
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,760
every year

1540
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,400
uh powerpoint the death by powerpoint

1541
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,240
slides so they can do the multiple

1542
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,240
choice question and if they get it wrong

1543
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,599
they can go back and then like you know

1544
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,760
choose again so they can be certified

1545
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,680
and regulated because you know sarbanes

1546
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,359
actually brand bleach lightly and all

1547
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,680
the other names and it's like yeah it's

1548
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,599
like all that stuff

1549
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,880
it's like but seriously show them how it

1550
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,359
actually happens

1551
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,000
don't just tell them that oh don't click

1552
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,559
links be careful phishing emails this is

1553
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,160
what you should watch out for

1554
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,599
give them something to to know

1555
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,119
interact with employees when things

1556
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,440
aren't on fire

1557
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,720
guess what

1558
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,920
this is gonna hurt some people's

1559
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,200
feelings here

1560
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,680
because it hurts mine sometimes

1561
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,520
employees don't necessarily like

1562
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,760
information security

1563
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,280
you're not the nicest people to be

1564
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,839
around sometimes

1565
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,599
when i used to work on a gang task force

1566
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,200
it's like guess what

1567
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,119
i got the joy

1568
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,000
of seeing everybody on their worst day

1569
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,640
of their life

1570
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,119
something horrible just happened to them

1571
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,359
and i show up

1572
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,799
i show up

1573
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,480
something horrible is about to happen to

1574
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,319
them

1575
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,319
it's not good

1576
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,319
that's the same way they see you in

1577
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,400
information security

1578
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,640
you only show up when something's bad

1579
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,000
has happened do luncheon learns show

1580
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,400
them how you're an actual asset show

1581
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,799
them how you look at them as an asset to

1582
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,559
the company to as you a part of the

1583
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:21,839
security team

1584
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,079
get them involved in that

1585
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,920
make them part of it make them know who

1586
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,960
you are

1587
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,440
and that you're trying to help

1588
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,640
before

1589
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,520
something bad happens

1590
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,599
and remember the three e's

1591
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,480
educating empowering your employees and

1592
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,960
then plus enforcing actual policies that

1593
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,799
help

1594
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,240
you need to be able to do that

1595
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,359
solution three stop making another task

1596
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,280
they should deal with and sell them on

1597
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,520
the idea it's a way to offset work to

1598
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,880
security

1599
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,680
human nature remember

1600
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,119
they don't want to do anything that

1601
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,599
they're not being paid to do

1602
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,280
so we need to make sure they understand

1603
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,680
that security is part of their job

1604
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,760
but then we also need to let them know

1605
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,200
yeah you don't want to you don't you

1606
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,559
don't really want to look at that email

1607
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,720
or respond to it looks a little sketchy

1608
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,480
just forward it to security make them

1609
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,079
deal with it

1610
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,920
you see a guy walking in in the the

1611
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,760
building under the arctic you don't want

1612
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,680
to touch them it's like call security

1613
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,880
make them deal with it make it their

1614
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,880
problem

1615
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,680
sell them on that because trust me i've

1616
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,400
been a perfect example humans are petty

1617
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,760
you know we don't like to do all that

1618
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,799
kind of work

1619
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,880
make the security people do it

1620
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,559
that's what they're there for

1621
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,000
they're they're there to go through all

1622
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,760
those freaking spam emails it's like all

1623
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,200
those different emails that you don't

1624
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,119
want to deal with

1625
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,200
it's like that's what you do

1626
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,839
you make them understand that you're

1627
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,680
there to help them and take some of the

1628
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,440
work from them

1629
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,960
and create teachable moments for your

1630
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,440
employees before a real attacker does

1631
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,440
in other words don't wait to hire

1632
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,880
something i love this because it's

1633
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,880
counterintuitive you don't have to hire

1634
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,680
me

1635
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,119
it's like when you're doing a security

1636
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,359
you shouldn't hire me you shouldn't be

1637
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,920
hiring any red team person or pen tester

1638
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,680
it's like when you're starting out a

1639
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,680
security awareness program or starting

1640
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,040
down your security trying to get your

1641
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,280
employees involved your employees should

1642
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,319
be doing that you should be

1643
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,160
understanding what that is and what the

1644
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,520
needs are

1645
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,119
it's like you need to make sure that

1646
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,920
you're set up for that first before you

1647
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,520
try to get someone else to come in and

1648
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,920
look at it

1649
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,799
oh i wasn't lying i'm done

1650
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,599
[Applause]

1651
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,760
yeah i'm only i'm keeping you all back

1652
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,240
so bad i'm sorry

1653
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,520
is there any questions everybody wants

1654
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,839
to get the gtfo and get a drink yes

1655
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,559
how do you hack remote employees do you

1656
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,359
go their home and steal their stuff or

1657
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,119
work from home employees

1658
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,599
oh my gosh those are easy

1659
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,119
because you know how many work from home

1660
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,040
employees are letting their children use

1661
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,880
their work computers

1662
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,480
do you know how many work from home

1663
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,079
employees are actually uh on unsecured

1664
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,160
wi-fi do you know how many work from

1665
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,240
home can employees are going to

1666
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,640
starbucks and panera bread to do their

1667
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,480
work because the wi-fi is better and

1668
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,520
they don't have to deal with their

1669
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,280
children harassing them while they're

1670
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,720
working

1671
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,200
if you think work from home protects you

1672
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,000
from getting compromised

1673
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,480
no it's like i would refer you to

1674
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,799
uh the 2004 uh dark source episode where

1675
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,520
a a an attacker went through a dual home

1676
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,119
vpn to get source code

1677
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,400
it's like

1678
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,440
don't trust your employees

1679
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,440
it's like people and another thing is

1680
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,280
when we talk about like we'll work from

1681
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,799
your network

1682
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,240
is not

1683
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,280
at that

1684
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,960
headquarters

1685
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,000
it's not just that's untrusted network

1686
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,280
everything should be considered

1687
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,559
untrusted

1688
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,839
it's like you should be actually looking

1689
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,559
exfiltration

1690
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,480
where you the whole thing i tell people

1691
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,799
is that we're so set in this mindset of

1692
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,880
trying to defend our networks from

1693
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,400
attack

1694
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,079
get over it

1695
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,400
it's gonna get popped

1696
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,720
something's going down

1697
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,119
okay no matter how good your defenses

1698
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,960
are at some point something can be

1699
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,640
compromised there's an imp

1700
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,680
how

1701
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,880
quickly

1702
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,799
do you detect

1703
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,680
and how quickly do you respond

1704
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,040
that's what we should be striving for

1705
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,400
is to make sure that our incident

1706
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,640
response is better making sure that our

1707
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,200
people understand when when to detect it

1708
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,039
when i broke into that company in 2020

1709
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,960
in the before times it's like it was

1710
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,200
amazing because even though i was

1711
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,520
successful

1712
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,520
but for how long

1713
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,559
that compromise only lasted 10 minutes

1714
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,599
tops

1715
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,119
and they were able to they've been able

1716
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,640
to curtail it they've been able to

1717
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,559
respond to it

1718
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:15,920
and that wouldn't have brought them out

1719
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,280
of business

1720
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,720
but how many companies have you seen

1721
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,160
that have been compromised for six

1722
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,440
months

1723
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,119
for a year

1724
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,200
a year and a half

1725
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,839
how much damage was done then

1726
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,920
my gosh sony freaking 1.8 terabytes of

1727
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,240
data leaving their network mother a

1728
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,079
network admission of at least asked hey

1729
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,039
would you like us to increase the

1730
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,480
bandwidth pipe it seems like you're

1731
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,720
doing a lot of data transfer

1732
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,200
nothing

1733
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,160
stop just trying to defend what's coming

1734
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,240
into your company or attacking site

1735
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,039
start looking closer at what's leaving

1736
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,480
it

1737
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,799
and how it's leaving

1738
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,200
that's where you find the compromises

1739
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,440
it's like how many people in here have

1740
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,440
firewall rules that say internal

1741
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,640
outside

1742
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,118
allow

1743
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,160
makes me want to

1744
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,799
seriously

1745
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,160
that's almost worse than the you know

1746
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,119
the any any rule

1747
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,480
so you have to make sure that you're

1748
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,960
doing that so work from home employees

1749
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,480
are just as easily compromised

1750
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,760
any other questions i i will be going to

1751
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,880
the after party because i know a lot of

1752
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,000
people don't like asking questions and

1753
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,079
also you want to get out of here uh and

1754
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,079
so so i'll be around and please stop me

1755
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,839
question me and ask me things i don't

1756
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,160
mind uh answering questions and helping

1757
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,400
out uh oh and i'm also holding up people

1758
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,640
so that's even better oh my gosh i'm in

1759

01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,160
like uh that's a good thing so i will
