1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,759
hey everyone so uh

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,279
i'm going to talk about how cyber war is

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,440
boring for a bit of background uh i'm

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,400
paddy there's a bit of noise

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,239
and uh i'm normally someone who does uh

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,160
cyber things that's what i'm supposed to

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,480
do i'm originally from tu dublin but i

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,160
spent more of my time as the community

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,240
manager for the open source r for the

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,760
arms control one

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,400
network of blogs and podcasts where i

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,439
mostly

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,560
plan the needs of open source

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
intelligence analysts for the future and

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,239
do some research in myself some of which

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,280
i've been lucky enough to have in the

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
washington post and the economist and as

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
well as this uh normally i have a giant

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,440
blog written with everything that i have

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
sourced and some more things i'm not

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,239
going to have the chance to talk about

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,360
in a talk

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,039
i don't have that blog written because

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,800
this talk was written in nine days for

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,680
b-sides so uh if you go to that link

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,920
that'll uh eventually there will be a

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,280
blog post up with everything you need

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,320
from this

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,039
as well as this a quick disclaimer i am

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,160
going to be talking about the war in

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,000
ukraine if you are sick of the war in

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,080
ukraine this is definitely not the talk

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
for you uh there is no dead bodies or

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
anything like that but there are

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,799
equipment on fire that kind of thing so

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,880
if you have ptsd or any triggers like

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,040
that this might not be the talk for you

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
and finally i stopped adding things to

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
the presentation about 36 hours ago and

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
i know some things have changed since

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
i am aware of those but at some point i

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
have to stop talking so um this kind the

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,759
genesis of this talk comes from a friend

44
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,159
of mine don edwards who said that uh

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,600
there's been a lot of talk about cyber

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
warfare but yet we have yet to see

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
anything um so

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
i'm gonna try and explain why we aren't

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,119
seeing it and more importantly why it's

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,640
quite a lot less interesting than a lot

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
of people are led to believe

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,560
and the idea for war is boring comes

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,640
from comic book artist david axe who

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,799
said that cyber war is a lot more about

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,280
politics paperwork and logistics than it

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
is about the actual combat and in a lot

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
of ways i think cyber is the same but

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
rather it's more about politics the

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,079
legalities around cyber and then

60
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,439
perceptions that people have of cyber

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
so if we look at the politics um

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
uh the late looking at cyber through the

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
lens of clouds is kind of the best way

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,879
to kind of think about how cyber impacts

65
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,120
people in these kind of ways so how

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,560
states actually use it and much like war

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,840
cyber is an extension of policy by other

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
means

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,760
this is to say that if you look at the

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,840
world as a runway you have a number of

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
actions that governments can take they

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
have the runway that is as long as it is

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,720
and then using cyber or going to war

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
allows you to add length onto the runway

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
for you to continue different actions

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
great example of this in recent memory

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,519
comes from this thing here this is

78
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,760
called the bronze soldier it's a statue

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
in tallinn estonia

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
this originally used to be in the city

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,879
center in thailand and it marked the

82
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,360
graves of 12 soviet soldiers who died

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,130
fighting the nazis in world war ii

84
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,239
[Music]

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,319
estonia continued fighting for their

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,280
freedom from the soviets into the 1950s

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,920
i think 53-54 they were still fighting

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,680
the conflict so

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
to a lot of estonians this right this

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,280
statue represents a

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
a kind of a way that they've had their

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
freedom crushed by the soviets and to a

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
lot of ethnic russians this statue

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,640
represents victory over the nazis so

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
this beca becomes a contentious issue

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,480
and in the city center they decided

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,840
we're going to move the statue the

98
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
government um and they're going to move

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
it elsewhere and of course this

100
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,640
generated uh protests and the protests

101
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
ran for a period of about two weeks but

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
in those two weeks uh the kremlin

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,120
started playing around with what we have

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,599
become familiar with today as cyber

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
warfare they started with ddos attacks

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,480
they defaced various websites but the

107
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
thing that really got people motivated

108
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
and got them going was

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,040
commenting on news articles and this

110
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,120
would generate massive rumors that

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
people would then spread around and talk

112
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
about outside of these news articles

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,400
this then led to people having uh

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
russian ethnic russian speakers then

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,640
looking at this and going this is

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,478
cultural genocide

117
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,279
this is our heritage being destroyed and

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,720
when you look at those things in that

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,240
lens rather than

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,960
this is a complicated symbol which has a

121
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
lot of intricacies around it and you

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,919
simplify it to that one narrow thing it

123
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,919
then all of a sudden

124
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
gets a little bit difficult so then over

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,759
the course of about two days towards the

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,040
end of april in 2007 uh riots erupted in

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
tallinn they originally came from where

128
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
a kremlin-backed protester

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
started to punch police officers and of

130
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
course we have seen how police tend to

131
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
respond when you punch them so

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,680
this strategy is what's called hybrid

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
warfare this is uh it's not a really

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
well defined idea i kind of think of it

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,840
best as it's a district it's a

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,639
strategically aimed political warfare

137
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,720
against democracies and democratic

138
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,560
institutions so for example the

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
government of ireland is a democracy you

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,080
can target uh various operations against

141
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
them or you could look at

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
democratic institutions so when russia

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
used chemical weapons in uh 2017 in

144
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,039
salisbury in the uk to assassinate the

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,919
skripals uh what they were doing there

146
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,360
was they were

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
taking advantage of vulnerabilities that

148
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,280
existed in the democratic organization

149
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
that is the organization of for the

150
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,600
prohibition of chemical weapons

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
and the way that hybrid warfare works is

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
that it blends a number of different uh

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,360
means of warfare so conventional warfare

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
which we've seen with the uprisings that

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
are backed by russia in

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,320
the donbasque and luhansk irregular

157
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,639
warfare as we saw when the little green

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,440
men

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,080
uh which are russian soldiers turned up

160
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,919
without badges which is

161
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,680
you know legally dubious um in 2014 in

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,759
crimea as well as that we see cyber

163
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,039
warfare even as recently as a couple of

164
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,880
weeks ago where we've seen websites

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,199
being defaced ddos attacks and you could

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,720
say the bears are doing it you could say

167
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,479
ghostwriter is doing it maybe it's both

168
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
of them doing it maybe one is doing it

169
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,479
at the behest of the other

170
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,240
and then finally influence operations

171
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,639
which is the stuff we see on a regular

172
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,199
basis when it comes to disinformation

173
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
maybe in in terms of propaganda which

174
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,039
various governments are putting out or

175
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
in the old russian favorite of active

176
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
measures where they actually try and

177
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
influence the direction that certain

178
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
things are taking in governments a great

179
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
example of that is the 2016 election in

180
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,479
the united states

181
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,880
and this entire idea falls into what's

182
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
called gray area operations you can have

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,280
normal diplomatic relations where for

184
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
example we recently saw michael martin

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
in washington dc he meets with the

186
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,400
president biden they have their back

187
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,599
well i don't think they actually met

188
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,520
because he's got covert now but in

189
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,960
theory what's supposed to happen is he

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
hands him this little basket of

191
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,199
shamrocks and that is like our little

192
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,960
bit of solidarity standing with them

193
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
these are long-standing traditions that

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
governments have in interacting with

195
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
each other in very normal ways sometimes

196
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,960
it's where ida ireland attracts

197
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,520
businesses into ireland sometimes it's

198
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
in the form of visiting academics coming

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
here to teach skills or how we teach

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
skills to

201
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
say for example doctors in other part of

202
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,319
the world here in ireland

203
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,199
then you have armed conflict which is

204
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,280
the actual war fighting that we see in

205
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
ukraine between russia and ukraine at

206
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
the moment and in between there is where

207
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,319
we tend to see most of cyber operations

208
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,120
happening it's where states are looking

209
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,720
at this gray area between war

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,319
and not war

211
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
and they work in the area of not war to

212
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,599
try and maximize any kind of advantages

213
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,719
to advance their goals

214
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,840
so uh as well as this uh there's the

215
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,759
legal aspects of it uh there's a very

216
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
important point in um when we look at

217
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,680
cyber attacks in the

218
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,240
international law terms where the

219
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,120
criterion for one of the three criterion

220
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,319
to define a cyber attack is that they

221
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
are violent in nature which is to say

222
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
that again looking at clausewitz

223
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
they cause damage or destruction to

224
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,280
property or they injure or kill people

225
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
and as we have seen there are arguments

226
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,360
to be made for stuxnet so it's a little

227
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,199
heavy out there but

228
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,599
to date we're not aware of ransomware

229
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,599
for example actually killing someone the

230
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,360
germans have tried to prosecute that

231
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,919
we're not aware of uh while there are

232
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,440
attacks using difficulty are not

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,760
defibrillators uh insulin pumps we're

234
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
not aware of one of them actually being

235
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
used to injure a patient on an insulin

236
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
pump and we're also not aware of while

237
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,839
the theory exists in the likes of the

238
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
triton malware

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
we have yet to see anything actually

240
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,399
damage or destroy equipment

241
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,360
um

242
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,959
if you look at this as well then in

243
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,040
irish law the only place that the word

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,760
attack exists is in the preamble to the

245
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,399
law

246
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
the reason for this is in irish law the

247
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,480
word attack is a charged word implying

248
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,040
violence in it and as we have also seen

249
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,519
there has not been violent uh cases

250
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,440
taken there as well so when you go and

251
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,600
read through the act you see it as like

252
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
interfering in the transmission of or

253
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,800
intercepting in the transmission of

254
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
rather than

255
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
you did an attack

256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,480
um which leads me to take this really

257
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,800
useless slide everywhere i go and hand

258
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
it out to people but the three important

259
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,360
bits on it are there is some kind of a

260
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
cyber operation

261
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
someone is using cyber somewhere to

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
accomplish some goal

263
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
the person who is doing it is doing it

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,640
for violent ends so they're looking to

265
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
damage or destroy property or kill or

266
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,519
injure humans and finally that whatever

267
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,000
intrusion is taking place is being

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,519
someone who is subjected to

269
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,000
international law so when you're looking

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,240
at this in regular terms all of us in

271
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,480
the room here we're regular individuals

272
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,800
we are not subject to international law

273
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
if someone here is in the military and

274
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
they're taking part in military

275
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
operations they are subject to

276
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,079
international law if there is uh well

277
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,600
the whole government can't be in the

278
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
room but if the government is taking

279
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
various different actions they are then

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,959
also subject to international law so you

281
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,640
need to meet all of these criteria and

282
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,920
to actually be committing cyber attacks

283
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
and this has then led thomas rid to go

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
on in a papery route to describe how

285
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,200
cyber war will not happen uh

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
he has said it will not it has not taken

287
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,320
place in the past it is not taking place

288
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,480
now and it is highly unlikely that it

289
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,640
will take place in the future and a lot

290
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,880
of his thinking for this comes from

291
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,680
a lot of what we see is sabotage

292
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,320
espionage and more importantly

293
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,519
subversion

294
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,040
a lot of what we see on a day-to-day

295
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,839
basis in regular cyber uh like when what

296
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,560
major cyber actors are doing uh at a

297
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
state level against other states is

298
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,200
espionage and subversion

299
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,000
and then recently a paper was written by

300
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
an academic called uh leonard meshmar

301
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,360
where uh he coined the idea of the

302
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
subversive trilemma

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,079
this is where he set a set of criteria

304
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,480
that defines the difference between what

305
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,040
is theoretically possible with what is

306
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
practically feasible because

307
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,360
theoretically the us still launches its

308
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,959
nuclear weapons using five and a half

309
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,560
inch floppy drives

310
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
in theory i can find out where they are

311
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
doing them uh like minting those floppy

312
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
drives lay my hands on them put some

313
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
kind of corrupt data on them for my own

314
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
ends and use them to launch nuclear

315
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,480
weapons but is that actually practically

316
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
feasible as a thing you can do well to

317
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
understand if it is his criteria for

318
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,480
looking at that come down to

319
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,399
operational speed the intensity of

320
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,800
effects and system control and these are

321
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
all interlinked so

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760
the faster you move means you have less

323
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
time to do reconnaissance you have less

324
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,720
time to develop your exploits you have

325
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,360
less time to use the exploits and not

326
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
get detected in the process

327
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,200
and and then when you do get into a

328
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
system on the other side of the exploits

329
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,920
to learn whatever that's connected to

330
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,160
how these various systems work if you

331
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
get in the other side of a telephone

332
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
switch for example

333
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,279
is it in erickson where erickson have

334
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,120
their own language for programming

335
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,959
telephones which is completely separate

336
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,560
what other companies use

337
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,120
or on the other side of it are you only

338
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,639
familiar with cisco systems and then all

339
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,160
of a sudden there are juniper systems on

340
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,360
the other side of it you might need to

341
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
learn the various different commands to

342
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
use them

343
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
and link to this is

344
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
if you move fast you're obviously not

345
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
going to have big effects with your

346
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
cyber because obviously what you've done

347
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,680
is not taken the time to develop these

348
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
intense effects in the end

349
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
and then how much control do you have

350
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,320
over it the more commands you issue on a

351
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
system the more noise you make and the

352
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,920
more noise you make the higher chance

353
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
you have of being detected

354
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
so if we then compare and contrast

355
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
stuxnet to what we've seen recently in

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,800
russia stuxnet took about five years to

357
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
develop and cost the entire olympic

358
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
games program cost somewhere around a

359
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,440
billion us dollars and resulted in

360
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,760
technically two pieces of malware and

361
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,600
one patch

362
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,560
um

363
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
using that kind of speed they had

364
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
incredible effects with the first

365
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
version of stuxnet which is known as 0.5

366
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,399
it was used between 2007 and 2008 in

367
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,040
natanz it ran completely autonomously

368
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,000
without any c2 and they used that they

369
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,639
used a system they had built in the y12

370
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
national security facility uh in oak

371
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,079
ridge tennessee to actually run at a

372
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,240
small scale demo

373
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,079
of the system

374
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,720
and uh then there's the destructive one

375
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
that well not destructive but the one

376
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,440
that everybody is familiar with which uh

377
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,240
is the one that became the worm

378
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
so if you look at the way these kind of

379
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
things worked in different fashions one

380
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,959
of them resulted in possible equipment

381
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,959
destruction and the other one did it

382
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,959
nothing but slow the nuclear program

383
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,399
down so

384
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,040
you ended up with roughly similar

385
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,079
lengths of

386
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,000
time that they took to develop and use

387
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,760
them and you had two wildly different

388
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,800
effects

389
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,079
one of them also ran completely unknown

390
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,480
and wasn't detected until 2013 when it

391
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,279
was detected by accident in virus total

392
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,199
and the other one as soon as it went

393
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,720
loose in the wild

394
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,240
everybody knew about it and it was all

395
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,519
over the news

396
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,959
so

397
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,279
melding these things together stuxnet is

398
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,680
a probably successful program that took

399
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,240
a lot of time to have really specific

400
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,600
intense effects

401
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,279
using a lot of control over these

402
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,320
systems

403
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,440
but you can't move fast and have the

404
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
other two effects so they did it really

405
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
slowly russia then on the other hand

406
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,480
well as live ua map got their hands on a

407
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,240
number of documents related to the

408
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,959
invasion vladimir putin uh approved it

409
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
on the 18th of january they were to

410
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,720
start on the 20th of february obviously

411
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,480
didn't start for another i think eight

412
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,440
days

413
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,320
uh

414
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
maybe that's us information operations

415
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,079
having worked very successfully to put

416
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,920
off that attack maybe it's because they

417
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
weren't able to get their false flag who

418
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
knows we probably won't know for a long

419
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,560
time and of course to end on march 6th

420
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,000
which

421
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,639
that's going well so uh

422
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,560
this is the kind of trade-off where they

423
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,360
had very limited time to develop

424
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
their attack plans and to develop

425
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,759
systems are to develop malware inside

426
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,680
systems that they could use for big

427
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,759
effects that people kind of expect and

428
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,759
that's not what we've seen now maybe

429
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,000
they did have stuff planted already but

430
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,199
that's an idea i'm going to come back to

431
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,040
in future

432
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,360
finally the other thing is perceptions

433
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
when we were seeing uh the cyber

434
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
partisans in belarus uh ransom wearing

435
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
ticket machines or when we were seeing

436
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,600
um

437
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,160
the ukrainian uh websites getting

438
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
defaced adam wallow said this is not the

439
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,040
cyber war we're promised and i think a

440
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,199
lot of this comes down to

441
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
this this is the kind of picture that

442
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,320
people have when they look at this is a

443
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
real picture of a real military unit the

444
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,639
780th military intelligence brigade

445
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,800
right you was like is it gonna work it

446
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,880
is this dude here

447
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,480
he has a usb cord being used as a sling

448
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,800
for his rifle

449
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,440
this guy has a trigger finger and he's

450
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,519
holding it away from the trigger like

451
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,160
he's ready to fire safely right and then

452
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,240
of course you've a nerd like me who's a

453
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
custom cherry keyboard right so

454
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,560
we end up with like this is the picture

455
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,680
we kind of have of what cyber should be

456
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
but if we then look at other forms of

457
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,079
warfare and how they kind of compare

458
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,639
my favorite iowa class battleships they

459
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,160
fire a volkswagen golf 30 nautical miles

460
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
with a grand piano worth of explosives

461
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,319
they don't really exist in war anymore

462
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,079
but you know if you think modern naval

463
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,760
combat this is one of the ideas that

464
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,839
people have another idea that people

465
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,799
have

466
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,880
is early bird class destroyers they fire

467
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,319
missiles out of vertical tubes and they

468
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,640
go away and fly and blow things up

469
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,039
but this isn't where naval warfare got

470
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,280
its start naval war warfare started

471
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,839
about 4 000 years ago in ancient egypt

472
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,039
where they literally built land on top

473
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,360
of boats so they think they could have

474
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
land battles

475
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
on a boat at sea

476
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,679
this is how naval war got started so

477
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,080
there is a train that like of thought

478
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,679
that has gone through millennia that is

479
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
developed where we are today with naval

480
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,000
warfare we see the same thing with

481
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,320
aircraft where for example we have

482
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,000
stealth aircraft that have like in this

483
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,720
case a particularly fantastic weird

484
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
metal camouflage system for some reason

485
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,320
but that's not how aerial combat got

486
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,880
started aerial combat didn't even start

487
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,039
as combat it started as men throwing

488
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,760
hand grenades out of planes and using

489
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
the mark one eyeball to

490
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
try and determine where this will land

491
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,039
and this is another idea that

492
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
cloudswitch had is that every age has

493
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,000
its own limiting conditions on warfare

494
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,480
and peculiar preconceptions that impact

495
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,520
how people think about war and a great

496
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,760
example of this comes in world war one

497
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
where we had curious years these are a

498
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,640
type of horse infantry that

499
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,120
can fight on horseback with sabres and

500
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,799
dismount and fight with wet with guns

501
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,960
right and they have horse hair helmets

502
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,360
and breast plates like someone is going

503
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
to come at them with a lance on a

504
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,640
medieval battlefield 500 years prior to

505
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,400
this actually existing

506
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
but this unit doesn't go away because

507
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
the ultimate idea of it is units that

508
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
can fight

509
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,880
mounted on something and then dismounted

510
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,640
and we can see the exact same unit

511
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,559
exists today there that's them doing

512
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,200
counter terrorism operations in mali

513
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
there are guys on the ground dismounted

514
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
ready to fight as well as these dudes

515
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,640
here who are in like their recon tank

516
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
thing right and we see them again where

517
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,840
they actually have full-on tanks as well

518
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,799
as dismounted infantry that are fighting

519
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,600
dismounted so while the entire idea of

520
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,160
how cavalry is used in warfare has gone

521
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,679
away

522
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,559
the way that they fight remains exactly

523
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,039
the same they have limiting conditions

524
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,880
on what they can do as a fighting force

525
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
and if you then look at cyber

526
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,640
i prefer to think of it not so much as

527
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
cyber but as information warfare for a

528
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,679
number of reasons and one of them is

529
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,960
it's something that's been thought about

530
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,440
for a very long time sun tzu has been

531
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,679
thinking about this for about 2 500

532
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,240
years 2 600 years now where he

533
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,600
essentially wrote the book on

534
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
information warfare he talked a lot in

535
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,919
his book about how you can use deception

536
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,000
to hide your strength deception

537
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
operations are something modern

538
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
militaries take part in all of the time

539
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,039
if you look at how some of

540
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,600
cyber is being used the hermetic wiper

541
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,159
that we seen in ukraine last week it

542
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,559
tried to deceive operators as to what it

543
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,320
was actually doing by running ransomware

544
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
at the same time as it was physically

545
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
wiping systems

546
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,159
and then as well as that that you

547
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,679
protect

548
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,840
your own forces using operational

549
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,760
security and day-to-day a lot of the

550
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,600
cyber things that we do

551
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,480
are

552
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,080
operational security elements where

553
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
we're attempting to secure access

554
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
controls on how you gain entry to

555
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,559
various systems or who can gain entry to

556
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,120
systems or do you meet the criteria to

557
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,440
gain entry to this system we also use

558
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
the work of this man here this is an

559
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
islamic scholar al-kundi

560
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
from 1100 years ago he invented most of

561
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,039
modern cryptography not only did he come

562
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,720
up with most of modern cryptography he

563
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,000
came up with

564
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,760
a lot of things he's a polymath he kind

565
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
of invented modern chemistry modern

566
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,320
islamic scholarship uh islamic

567
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
philosophy optics

568
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,159
but

569
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
the thing he's most famous for in our

570
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,960
realm or at least should be is

571
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
if you've ever done cryptanalysis if

572
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
you've ever done frequency analysis of

573
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,159
various different pieces of uh

574
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,200
encrypted

575
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
information you can thank him for that

576
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
and we while we still use a lot of his

577
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
techniques today

578
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,840
pen and paper using his methods were

579
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
used until mechanical encryption came

580
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,480
around in the 1920s so he had about a

581
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
thousand year run

582
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,880
of protecting information very securely

583
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,480
using systems

584
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
and if we then go to world war one we

585
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
have this group here this is room 40

586
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,799
these are the people who birthed the

587
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,200
idea of signals intelligence

588
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,960
uh germany what they were doing in world

589
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,520
war one was they had a bunch of

590
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
code books but they weren't to hold

591
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,520
encrypted information they were books

592
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,840
that were like hundreds of thousands of

593
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,880
pages long and they had entries in them

594
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,600
for

595
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,760
any message that you could possibly

596
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
think of that you might want to send in

597
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,280
peace or war and what you would do is

598
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,559
uh tap out that message on page 4522

599
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,960
and that when that gets relayed back

600
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,080
they then know okay i am headed north

601
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,600
out of keel

602
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
and that's all it means but they got

603
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,960
their hands on the code books they

604
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,640
started to figure out how to decipher

605
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
them and how to use them and then they

606
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,039
were able to use them to kind of force

607
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,520
battles on the germans

608
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,919
these things called decisive battles not

609
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,919
going to get into it but not only that

610
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,440
they also came up with another idea

611
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,679
which has become very important in not

612
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,200
just in cyber but generally in

613
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
information warfare called radio

614
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
direction finding if you've seen the

615
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,039
lady earlier who was talking about

616
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,880
open source uh

617
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,400
using sdrs for radio frequency analysis

618
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
it's the same kind of idea can you

619
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,679
pinpoint where in the world the

620
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,640
transmitter is based on how it works if

621
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,039
you've ever had to try and find your

622
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,919
wi-fi box uh in an apartment that you've

623
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,840
just moved into you want to find the

624
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
code to use it you can use your phone

625
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,679
and you can watch the strength increase

626
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,840
as you walk along it's the same kind of

627
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,240
idea but they you they turned the

628
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,600
entirety of britain into a radio antenna

629
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
and they were very able to very

630
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,760
precisely figure out where various ships

631
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,679
are so when german mine laying

632
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,080
operations were taking place they knew

633
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
exactly where those ships were to a huge

634
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
degree of accuracy and they were able to

635
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
then figure out exactly where the

636
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,039
minefields were and when uh the battle

637
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,360
of jutland happened in 1916 they were

638
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,679
able to chase the germans into their own

639
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,520
minefields because the british knew

640
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,679
where they were

641
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,760
and this then comes on to world war two

642
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,440
where we have dudes like this

643
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,120
this is an operator of a system called

644
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,039
hofduff high

645
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
high frequency direction finding this is

646
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
how they hunted u-boats

647
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,279
the idea here is you move in a line and

648
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,919
as you move along you were watching the

649
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,760
radio frequency on the little scope

650
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,600
thing he has there

651
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,159
update as the u-boat is putting out its

652
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,919
morse code and that allows you to then

653
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,080
figure out the location of that u-boat

654
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,480
in space go and

655
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,799
charge it sync it

656
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,799
and ultimately this then brings us on to

657
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,159
claude shannon who came up with this

658
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,159
mathematic mathematical theory of

659
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,720
communication this then becomes not just

660
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,559
the fundamental underlying

661
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,360
uh

662
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,240
theory of how most cyber works it also

663
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,760
becomes the fundamental underlying of

664
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,640
how a lot of information warfare works

665
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,600
because

666
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
ultimately he's talking about how

667
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
electrons fly around in space electronic

668
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
warfare is all about manipulating those

669
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,720
electrons in space

670
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
and if you jump forward into the future

671
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,840
then uh this is part of waypoint 2028

672
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,400
this is how the us army intends to fight

673
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,080
wars against what they call near piers

674
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,120
it's a very fancy word to say china

675
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,640
and

676
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,760
in it they have two major elements one

677
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,240
is the theater fires command the theater

678
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,559
fires command is basically instead of

679
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,200
having you pick up your radio and call

680
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,840
down to the artillery battery attached

681
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,279
to your unit

682
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,600
you call theater fires command instead

683
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,520
and theater fires command will use the

684
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,559
assets they have at their disposal land

685
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,039
sea air space and information to then

686
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,600
util be utilized against your adversary

687
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,080
for maximum effect now that could mean

688
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
using one on its own it could mean using

689
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,039
all five for maximum effect it could be

690
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,279
any number in between they will use the

691
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,200
assets that they have available at that

692
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
time to deliver the most fire that you

693
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,159
need

694
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,240
and the other one is this fun unit

695
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,159
little here this is the theater

696
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,039
information advantage element

697
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,640
and this is the cyber people information

698
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,480
advantage is some an information

699
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
advantage is something that allows you

700
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,000
to

701
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,279
think and decide quicker and more

702
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,840
effectively than your adversary so when

703
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,559
you're fighting in a war if i have

704
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,960
better information than anyone else

705
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
i know more about you and what you're

706
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,080
doing your unit dispositions and how to

707
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,039
best fight against you with what i have

708
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
so the us is attempting to do this and

709
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,640
they're attempting to do what what they

710
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,320
call enhanced non-lethal capabilities to

711
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,880
conduct information warfare uh to

712
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,960
protect friendly information and inform

713
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
and influence activities through forward

714
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,919
posture persistently engaged blah blah

715
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,360
blah

716
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,360
all of this comes from the 2018 us eod

717
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,159
cyber strategy this is a policy document

718
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,000
that they're giving to lawmakers to

719
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,320
understand how the department of defense

720
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,480
is going to be fighting wars so what

721
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,200
they're saying to policy people

722
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
is cyber

723
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,720
what they're saying to the troops

724
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,279
is information warfare so these are the

725
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,600
peculiar preconceptions

726
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
that then we have

727
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,919
when it comes to cyber it's a problem

728
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,520
that's existed for about two and a half

729
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,120
thousand years people have been thinking

730
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,320
about it for about two and a half

731
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,679
thousand years

732
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,799
and it's not something that's just stuck

733
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,559
to what i can do on computer magic

734
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,200
keyboard cyber bullet pew pew

735
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,799
as well as that

736
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,559
claude shannon being the fundamental

737
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,360
underlying theory of how

738
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,440
it's used imposes a number of

739
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,880
limitations

740
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,799
on these systems

741
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,000
you can only open up a certain number of

742
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,159
attacks because there's only a certain

743
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,919
number of vectors here unless of course

744
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,559
you want to attack yourself but that's

745
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,720
not great so this opens up a tax where

746
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,559
you can degrade these are what are

747
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,279
considered attacks against information

748
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,360
itself

749
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
my favorite example of this it's not

750
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,200
exactly coming up great unfortunately on

751
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,919
the slide is not petcha

752
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,480
not petcha is ransomware that was

753
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,200
ransomware that was delivered by sand

754
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,720
worm in 2016 using the eternal blue

755
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,120
exploit and to move faster through the

756
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
network they also had mini caps attached

757
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,799
to it so that any credentials that were

758
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,120
sitting in memory they would use to

759
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,960
continue moving along the network and

760
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,360
propagate the worm where it would

761
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,720
encrypt as ransomware all of the systems

762
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,279
when they had all the systems encrypted

763
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,440
they would delete the master boot record

764
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,080
and then delete the partition table of

765
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,880
where all of the files are so

766
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,039
even if they didn't delete the

767
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,000
encryption key which they did do

768
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
you still wouldn't be able to recover

769
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,399
any of your files the entire idea behind

770
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,640
this was destructive and the reason they

771
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,880
did this was it was distributed through

772
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,399
ukrainian tax software called me doc

773
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,520
they backdoored the

774
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,080
update servers for it and they use that

775
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,159
to distribute it then to anyone who was

776
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,559
doing accounting in ukraine you had to

777
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
have this software so this resulted then

778
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
in anyone who had this just losing their

779
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,240
data indiscriminately and this is just

780
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,799
because russia doesn't like ukraine

781
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,600
so then if we pivot to today

782
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,520
i love this this is what hackers have

783
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,840
been doing attempting to jam russian

784
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,799
communications by drawing my little pony

785
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,200
and bumblebees and whatever that lion

786
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,159
thing is so when you um i don't have

787
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,080
audio for this one uh but what you hear

788
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,240
when they're doing this is they're just

789
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
putting out at specific frequencies

790
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,320
beeps

791
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,480
and these beeps come across it sounds

792
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,320
like if you've ever picked up the phone

793
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,880
when we had dial-up it sounds exactly

794
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,720
like that it's exactly the same thing

795
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,840
and they're doing this to try and mess

796
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
with russian tactical communications

797
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,960
as well as this we've seen ukraine

798
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,840
inserting latency into gps

799
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,000
communications which means that the

800
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,720
google maps locations that russia is

801
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,279
using to target russian our ukrainian

802
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,039
facilities such as this air defense

803
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,240
facility

804
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,919
because they are inserting the latency

805
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,520
and we're talking about things that rely

806
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,279
on atomic clocks

807
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,600
tiny bits of latency mean you end up off

808
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,120
by meters in your actual artillery fire

809
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,880
so when they're trying to blow up these

810
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,080
systems they're unable to

811
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,559
uh you can also deny access to

812
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,120
information the easiest and most common

813
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,039
way to do this is to attack the receiver

814
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,760
itself uh in intelligence terms you have

815
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
collection assets where these could be

816
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
for example a cam or webcam that you

817
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
have on a building in keefe and you're

818
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,000
using that to actually watch what's

819
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,799
going on so you would attack the camera

820
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,559
now you could do that by cyber means but

821
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,799
you know sledgehammers are pretty useful

822
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,679
uh a great example of this comes in 2019

823
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,360
at the end of 2019 uh

824
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,120
there was i don't know if anyone

825
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,200
remembers that the other time recently

826
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,240
we nearly had world war iii where uh

827
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,880
you uh iran and the united states were

828
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,559
kind of at loggerheads over a number of

829
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,799
different issues one of the things that

830
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,399
happened was the us flew a global hawk

831
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,919
drone very close to ukrainian airspace

832
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,519
this is essentially an intelligence

833
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,880
gathering drone

834
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,760
and

835
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,399
when it crossed what you iran believed

836
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,080
to be the line that demarcated iranian

837
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,320
airspace from international airspace he

838
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,919
immediately shot it out of the sky with

839
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,279
one of these batteries a severance

840
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,120
and in response to this

841
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,960
as a show of force what the united

842
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,080
states did was they attempted to take

843
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,840
out the fire control computers that

844
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,519
actually allowed you

845
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,880
to launch the missiles using cyber means

846
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,480
now we don't know the specifics of what

847
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,399
it is all we

848
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,320
have is for example this new york times

849
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,919
report that says

850
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,279
it worked trust me it's fine and a few

851
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,960
other reports that go along similar

852
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,000
lines so you can use cyber to take out

853
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,320
these receivers but as we've seen in the

854
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,240
current conflict um

855
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,600
bombs are kind of a hell of a lot more

856
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,960
useful when you actually want to take

857
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,080
them out

858
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,760
the other interesting thing you can do

859
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,320
is instead of attacking the receiver you

860
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,399
could look at who is using the

861
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,720
information and attack them so for

862
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,840
example uh instead of

863
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,440
taking the receiver what if you leave

864
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,519
the receiver up but you decide we want

865
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,120
to figure out where the analysts are and

866
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,600
then attack that facility

867
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,960
this is something the us did in the

868
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,080
first gulf war where uh this was sudan's

869
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,120
regime command center where all aspects

870
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,840
of the iraqi military were coordinated

871
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
from and

872
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,519
uh in the left is the

873
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,600
pre-strike where they had decided where

874
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,679
all of the important facilities were and

875
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,799
then the right is post strike where they

876
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,440
had it targeted and attempted to draw

877
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,600
destroy as much of them as possible with

878
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,720
varying degrees of success um ukraine

879
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,559
and the i on the other hand has been

880
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,000
doing something slightly differently

881
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,320
which is

882
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,159
recently in the news against the russian

883
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,159
command post where they are attempting

884
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,440
to degrade uh ukraine's ability to

885
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,000
actually fight by taking out their

886
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
generals

887
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,799
and as of 36 hours ago this is the list

888
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,760
of dead generals of and high ranking

889
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,840
officers of various different ranks i

890
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,760
would note there are two more to be

891
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,240
added to this list since then

892
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,880
and this is removing the ability for

893
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,159
high-level russian forces to actually

894
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,919
go forward and fight so when you're

895
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,320
sometimes looking at stall

896
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,000
not the stalled convoy that's probably

897
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,760
logistics but if you all of a sudden

898
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,679
look at why

899
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,919
uh they have resorted to brute force

900
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,600
shelling in certain parts of the country

901
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
or they have resorted to

902
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,240
uh stall defensives it's probably

903
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,200
because they have no one to make the

904
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,000
final call because who wants to

905
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,918
i don't know decide we should attack or

906
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,199
should not attack when people

907
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,040
mysteriously just fall out of windows in

908
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
the country

909
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,000
so

910
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,480
you can also then corrupt information

911
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,040
sources now this isn't where you attack

912
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,879
information itself this is where you uh

913
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,839
inject noise into information systems so

914
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,679
that you can do various things

915
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,839
so uh israel has these jets here these

916
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,918
are a signals intelligence and an

917
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,560
electronic intelligence aircraft um and

918
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,119
the one in the foreground was part of a

919
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,079
raid into syria in 2008 where they were

920
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,760
attempting to blow up a

921
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,879
suspected syrian nuclear weapons uh

922
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,199
our nuclear reactor that was being

923
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,879
constructed

924
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,280
and when they were going along this is

925
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,879
what the radar picture looked like to

926
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,359
the to the operator but using electronic

927
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,119
warfare you can do what's called

928
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,000
painting a false sky picture where you

929
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,480
give a false sense to the operators of

930
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,960
what it looks like by essentially

931
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
injecting bits

932
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,839
into the radar so they go along and all

933
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,480
of a sudden this is the radar picture

934
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,160
nothing has changed apart from the

935
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,720
formation of israeli units has vanished

936
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,560
and that's all because the bits they're

937
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,640
sending along are saying there's nothing

938
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,200
here ignore me don't look at that

939
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
and we see this today in a lot of

940
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,320
different ways recently um open facto

941
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,320
who is a french fact-checking website uh

942
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,119
distribu uh uh discovered that there's a

943
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,839
group of websites called inforos and

944
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,880
inforos is approximately 1300 different

945
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,040
websites that are run by russian

946
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,440
military intelligence and what they are

947
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,079
doing is uh

948
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,760
basically acting as

949
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
secondary propaganda arms

950
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,160
to the state so not just have they uh rt

951
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,720
sputnik those kind of news media sites

952
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,880
um that are kind of

953
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,640
showing particular

954
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,560
views of the world that the regime is

955
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,960
happy with they also run secondary

956
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,440
propaganda operations that are doing

957
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,640
local level to like um

958
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,359
the

959
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,160
uh rayons they're they're uh oblasts

960
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,640
these are regions so like county dublin

961
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,400
county galway county loud those kind of

962
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,839
things as well as municipalities so

963
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,640
targeting uh not just all of dublin but

964
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,480
greater dublin and then you could target

965
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,400
cities so like limerick and cork and you

966
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,440
would have specific propaganda targeted

967
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,240
at those areas as well

968
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,320
you could also do cool stuff like this

969
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,920
which is after

970
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,480
the russians brutally destroyed one of

971
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
the greatest pieces of humanitarian

972
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,280
equipment the world possesses the an225

973
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,599
mirror

974
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,920
people then decided well we can spoof a

975
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
dsb data we're going to bring it back to

976
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,359
life we're going to fly it and lapse

977
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,320
around uh kiev and we're going to have

978
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,839
the call sign b [ __ ] putin

979
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,520
and then uh something that i have to

980
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,680
keep in mind for cyber people is

981
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,920
uh when we're talking about corrupted

982
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,520
information sources

983
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
we can use algorithms to create tailored

984
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
messages for people my favorite example

985
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,119
of this is twitter you can have a look

986
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,440
at twitter and a few years ago you used

987
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,480
to get

988
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,760
as things came in by the second

989
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,440
everything that was happening in your

990
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
feed but now you don't get that you get

991
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,960
the curated picture of what twitter

992
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
wants to show you based on whatever

993
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,320
filter bubble they have pigeonholed you

994
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,440
into

995
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,480
um this could also be used from like

996
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,880
while twitter can do like okay jobs but

997
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
this can be used for malicious purposes

998
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,240
and my favorite example of that in

999
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,400
recent memory is when the chinese

1000
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,920
property giant everground was collapsing

1001
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,240
it was huge news here in the west but it

1002
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,640
was essentially not talked about beyond

1003
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
the great firewall and anytime people

1004
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,480
tried to send this information beyond

1005
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,599
the great firewall mysteriously vanish

1006
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,839
so you can use this to create curated

1007
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,079
pictures of what the world looks with

1008
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,240
algorithms

1009
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,400
and then finally we end up with attacks

1010
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,119
that exploit information and this isn't

1011
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,040
exploit in the traditional cyber sense

1012
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,280
this is exploit in intelligence terms

1013
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,119
where you are looking at how things are

1014
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,359
for example how data is moving around in

1015
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,280
your network and what you can learn by

1016
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,480
those data

1017
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
flows in your network so for example

1018
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,480
exfiltration

1019
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
can you look at how various things are

1020
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,119
happening in your network and see that

1021
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,599
that's an unusually large number of dns

1022
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,440
text requests being made out to that

1023
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,359
weird server why is what's going on

1024
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,680
there so you can then figure out maybe

1025
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,200
someone's excellent trading data and you

1026
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,839
can decide to take actions based on that

1027
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,720
so we can then go to this this is my

1028
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,240
favorite game recently that i've been

1029
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,599
playing with everyone who's gotten this

1030
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,079
talk we're going to play find the army

1031
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,000
how many people can find the thousand

1032
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,359
people in this photograph

1033
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,280
anyone

1034
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,720
no

1035
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,520
so ah there is whenever my pointer

1036
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,240
decides to work

1037
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,280
there is a command post here and some

1038
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,359
units behind it we can follow it up the

1039
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,040
road then and there's some more stuff

1040
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,680
and there's a dude out in the open and i

1041
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,359
know there's some stuff over here but

1042
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,359
i've yet to find them and we can look

1043
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,079
over here and there's more dudes here

1044
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,079
and the us is this really cool type of

1045
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,000
camouflage which is blends in with the

1046
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,680
natural background that makes people

1047
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,200
turn into rocks

1048
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,680
so you can actually do that and you know

1049
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,920
if you look at that you can blend in and

1050
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,640
hide a lot of stuff in that gap

1051
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,400
but you'll notice

1052
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,640
there's also an antenna there

1053
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,920
and every soldier has tactical radios

1054
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,440
so what if you just start gathering the

1055
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,160
data instead of looking for the soldiers

1056
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,599
you can find them using electronic

1057
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,000
warfare

1058
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,920
[Music]

1059
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,359
this is the disposition of those

1060
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,960
thousand people going the whole way back

1061
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,200
to the mountain and it also includes

1062
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,359
this bit here this is what's called

1063
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,160
train this is the logistics supply for

1064
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,520
those troops if they end up fighting

1065
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,760
and if we then look at the number one

1066
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
question that i've been asked

1067
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,000
why are the phone networks still up why

1068
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,240
do people have internet connectivity

1069
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
and you know in a way that's a really

1070
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,280
good question but a lot of it comes down

1071
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,160
to

1072
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,280
both russia and ukraine have been using

1073
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,640
the phone networks for their own c2

1074
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,319
not all of them have tactical radios and

1075
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,680
the tactical radios they do have

1076
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,440
sometimes they're in the clear so the

1077
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,680
only way to get communications out is to

1078
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,839
use phone calls and something ukraine

1079
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,839
has been doing is this

1080
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,880
foreign

1081
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,200
foreign

1082
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,400
so what they're actually doing in

1083
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,720
individual terms is they're trying to

1084
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,880
direct how they're using their fire

1085
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,960
using artillery

1086
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,280
as well as that we also end up with this

1087
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,520
this is um tactical radio communications

1088
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
that a friend of mine actually captured

1089
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,200
of russian units and i have the

1090
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,160
translation there as well

1091
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,160
so you can actually just sit and go

1092
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,480
along and do legitimate signals

1093
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
intelligence

1094
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,839
and gather the tactical communications

1095
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,760
that they're using and this isn't a

1096
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,920
rocket science thing because i have

1097
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,240
another one

1098
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,560
so this generate the reason that the

1099
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
network stay up is because russia is

1100
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,800
desperately relying on them and ukraine

1101
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,319
is getting an incredible amount of

1102
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,079
intelligence out of using these systems

1103
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,000
the other thing as well is that the

1104
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
final point i want to make is

1105
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,599
when we're talking about these in

1106
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,760
military terms these are known as

1107
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,079
computer network operations

1108
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,760
and the ones everybody's kind of

1109
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,359
thinking about are computer network

1110
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,520
attacks

1111
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,040
i've also mentioned computer network

1112
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,960
exploitation using these systems to

1113
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,560
gather intelligence about what's going

1114
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,079
on

1115
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,880
but no one's talking about defense

1116
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,440
and i think the one thing that has been

1117
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,680
missing from any discussion that we have

1118
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,200
had about where are the cyber attacks is

1119
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,800
the incredible role that defense has

1120
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,480
actually played

1121
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,400
there's a concept in military terms

1122
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,960
called battlefield shaping battlefield

1123
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,440
shaping is everything you do before the

1124
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,560
war starts to make sure the terrain is

1125
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,880
exactly as you want it

1126
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,200
and this is the list of successes

1127
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,359
that have happened on the defense side

1128
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,319
beginning in november 2011 or sorry uh

1129
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,560
2001 or jesus i am bad at words now uh

1130
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,839
november 2021 where the us cyber command

1131
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,160
along with civilian contractors went

1132
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,880
into ukraine specifically going around

1133
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,280
critical pieces of infrastructure and

1134
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,520
bit by bit taking them apart and

1135
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,319
removing malware left right and center

1136
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,640
wherever they found us this was in the

1137
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,760
financial times just last week i have

1138
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,359
not seen people mentioning that this is

1139
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,280
the case all that often

1140
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,319
then in january of 2022 people thought

1141
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,599
that viasat had their ka sat taken down

1142
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,839
and a number of communications receivers

1143
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,760
for it destroyed

1144
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,160
the nsa in january put out a warning

1145
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,119
saying

1146
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,240
if you have one of these vsat terminals

1147
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,720
updated and all of a sudden

1148
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,520
ukraine they continue to be able to use

1149
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,400
these systems because they had they paid

1150
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,560
attention to the intelligence that was

1151
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,760
coming in

1152
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,200
drag us in every i think it's three a

1153
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,280
month or so publish these little

1154
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
knowledge packets for their customers

1155
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,200
and they give you brief synopsis on

1156
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,359
their blog of what's available and

1157
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,920
they've discovered in destroyer or as

1158
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,160
they call it crash override

1159
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,839
which was used previously to take down

1160
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,520
the power grid in keefe in 2016 and

1161
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,280
black energy which was used to take down

1162
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,240
the same power grid in 2014

1163
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,440
um

1164
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,240
they talked about that in both january

1165
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,920
and in february

1166
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,240
microsoft mystic detected whisper gate

1167
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,480
in the week leading up to it eset

1168
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,040
detected hermetic wiper after everything

1169
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,319
had begun

1170
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,720
um microsoft detected something called

1171
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,359
foxblade we don't know anything about it

1172
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,760
but within the hour of the attacks

1173
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,200
beginning

1174
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,680
microsoft had detected this uh attack

1175
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
and then not just that within three

1176
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,200
hours they had patched the

1177
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,599
vulnerabilities that had gone into it

1178
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,599
and then finally fortinet have been

1179
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,400
providing free ddos uh protection to the

1180
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,839
ukrainian police who were the ones

1181
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,480
getting the brunt of ddos attacks at the

1182
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,400
beginning of the campaign

1183
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,560
so where are the cyber attacks

1184
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,119
uh primarily

1185
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,520
problem is cyber is deeply misunderstood

1186
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,359
and people kind of think it's magic

1187
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,560
but it isn't

1188
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
the other thing is these things take

1189
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,359
time

1190
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,839
investment to prepare and pre-position

1191
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,520
russia had this and then it was taken

1192
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,880
away from them

1193
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,040
cyber has limitations that's a shock to

1194
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,400
people

1195
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,640
and uh as well as that people have been

1196
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,599
thinking about this for a very long time

1197
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,359
so this is just one of a range of

1198
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,520
options available to militaries

1199
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,760
and sometimes things that go bang or

1200
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,720
boom are just more effective than cyber

1201
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
and finally the defensive efforts just

1202
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,680
aren't sexy so they're under-reported

1203
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,000
so i'll take questions now but uh i

1204
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,760
couldn't do this talk on my own so i'd

1205
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,079
like to thank tinfoil jack and aminal

1206
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,240
for wargaming ideas with me helping me

1207
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,839
find some of the documents and for

1208
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,920
generally good crack along with it um

1209
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,440
microbiota designed a ton of the

1210
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,359
graphics you've seen that i've used

1211
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,680
david helped me get the signals uh

1212
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,440
intercepts that you've seen victor

1213
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,520
helped me translate them and sign and

1214
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,960
help me with various pieces of

1215
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,119
linguistic support along the way so

1216
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,920
thank you for listening
