1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,240
the other speakers today so thank you

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,600
for those of you that stuck around after

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,600
that great keynote uh so of course i'm

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,120
keith hoodlett i'm going to be talking

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,639
about the concept of security is a

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,679
feature

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,120
um before we get started i'd like to

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,480
give a little bit about sort of the

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,320
perspective that i bring to the table

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,520
and sort of the things that i've done

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,359
that give me this perspective

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,960
so my current role as a code security

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
architect or sometimes a code scanning

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
architect at github really that means i

15
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
get to play with codeql all day and sort

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,160
of find interesting bugs for companies

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,920
that aren't sort of default within the

18
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,359
product space

19
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,640
sort of a great company to be doing it

20
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,640
for especially in open source

21
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,399
but previously i worked as a director of

22
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,000
application experience at thermo fisher

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
scientific most people don't know who

24
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,440
they are in fact i didn't know who they

25
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,200
are until i got recruited there more

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,960
than half of the world's covet 19

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,480
testing touches at least one of their

28
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,680
products

29
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,840
the human genome was initially sequenced

30
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,000
in the 1990s on their device and the

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,719
original cyrus cova 2 virus in wuhan

32
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,559
was mapped on their device at the

33
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,640
laboratories in muhan

34
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
they also make freezers that sort of are

35
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,199
used for transporting the mrna vaccines

36
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,479
about

37
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,159
but beyond that they work in the

38
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,479
laboratory science space in forensics so

39
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,320
interpol the department of justice and

40
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,080
the fbi in the united states and others

41
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,159
use their products and devices

42
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,400
laboratories especially universities use

43
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
their products for chemical weapons

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
testing can imagine who might not want

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
that data to get out

46
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
and of course olympic drug testing

47
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,720
committee laboratories for checking if

48
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
athletes are cheating also use their

49
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,520
products so

50
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,720
uh you can imagine the sort of fun

51
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
things that we got to see and uh work

52
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
with at thermo fisher

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
i also previously hosted the application

54
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,280
security weekly podcast with paula

55
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,840
sidorian we start with zero whenever we

56
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
count as a development team so we

57
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
started with zero there

58
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
i've done some bug bounty hunting

59
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
especially against uh ford motor company

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,600
netgear and others

61
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,280
i love to write code and visual studio

62
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
code even before i worked for github and

63
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
now especially

64
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,880
python based and javascript are sort of

65
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,000
the things you'll see on my open source

66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
projects and i've worked on a few as

67
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,960
well

68
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,320
other than these last two years i love

69
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,079
to travel learn new languages i have yet

70
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,880
to pick up irish but someday i promise

71
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
and otherwise i'm reading and writing

72
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,200
sometimes traveling and programming

73
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,440
so let's start by thinking about what do

74
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,959
your development teams your project

75
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
management teams your product teams

76
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
think about as a feature

77
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,319
they're first going to think about

78
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
what the customer is asking for

79
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,520
i want an edit button on twitter

80
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,440
i still haven't got one yet

81
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
but again customers will ask you for

82
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,319
things right

83
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,800
your company will spend time and money

84
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
on the things that your customers are

85
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,239
asking you for and often allocate people

86
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,959
teams resources to that

87
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,720
they will take those features and

88
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,840
they'll make sure that they're tested

89
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,040
that they don't break every time you

90
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,319
have a new release

91
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,480
and that over time they sort of get

92
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
better right again i still want that

93
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,879
edit button at twitter

94
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,319
so again traditional features

95
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,120
so why isn't security considered a

96
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
feature by these development teams why

97
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
aren't they allocating time

98
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
just by a show of hands how many of you

99
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,879
have some sort of banking or finance or

100
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,239
investment application on your phone

101
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,920
nearly all of you

102
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
so that's the first question i ask the

103
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
development team

104
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,319
the second question i ask them after

105
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,560
we've done some sort of scan of some

106
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,319
kind or some sort of manual security

107
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,959
test is would you use it

108
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
if it had the vulnerabilities that your

109
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,280
application has

110
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
and the look on their face is sort of

111
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
one of three things either you've just

112
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
called their baby ugly

113
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,799
they can't believe you said that

114
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,760
or total disbelief and absolutely not

115
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
and it's it's sort of this

116
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
expectation that the things you're using

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
on your phone on your device or on your

118
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
computer are in fact secure they won't

119
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
ask you for it and i say in any of the

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
countries i've visited so far and if you

121
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,879
know of one that's different please tell

122
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
me after this talk

123
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,159
when you go up to a water faucet that

124
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,239
has two two handles and you twist the

125
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
one that's on the left it's hot you

126
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
didn't have to ask for it to be that way

127
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
you didn't have to ask for that to be

128
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,959
installed that way it is just that way

129
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,200
and security is sort of that expectation

130
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
that when you open that application when

131
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
you give it credentials or your personal

132
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
information that it is in fact secure

133
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,640
hint it's usually not

134
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,200
but again expectations

135
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
of course same thing as well

136
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
if you're not building security into

137
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
your application it is both costly to

138
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,079
fix

139
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,680
and uh in some cases you have to sort of

140
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
do a total rebuild

141
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
challenges that we saw at thermo fisher

142
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,880
included software that had hard-coded

143
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,080
credentials

144
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
in laboratories that were doing chemical

145
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,520
weapons analysis

146
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,120
and the sort of sudden need to fix that

147
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
was a breaking change for some of these

148
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
laboratories

149
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,160
and that wasn't going to work very well

150
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
so of course many hours were spent a lot

151
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
of money was spent to now have to go and

152
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,479
remediate that because of regulate

153
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
regulatory requirement

154
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
and then finally

155
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
your security will often be tested

156
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
whether you know that or not or whether

157
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
someone is willing to tell you is an

158
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
entirely different thing and i say in

159
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,520
some ways it's like cellular you sort of

160
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
expect it to work everywhere and then

161
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
suddenly you get into a brick building

162
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
and uh not so much um but again

163
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
all these things are sort of pointing to

164
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that security should be thought of as a

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
feature by your development teams and

166
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,560
your product teams but it's just

167
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
generally not so again those two

168
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
questions do you have a finance or

169
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
investment or banking application on

170
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
your phone and

171
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
would you use it

172
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,520
if it had the vulnerabilities that your

173
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,880
application now has and we know that

174
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
they have

175
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,919
so what happens when you don't treat

176
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,280
security as a feature we have you know

177
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,080
multiple examples of this um one sort of

178
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,479
great example is capital one

179
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,080
uh back in 2019 they had a breach of

180
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,960
over 110 million users credentials and

181
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,639
other sort of information

182
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
they were only fined 80 million us

183
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
dollars which i thought was rather low

184
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
but one of the sort of bigger problems

185
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
that they had as a result of this is

186
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
right after this breach occurred many of

187
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
their security organization left

188
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
because they knew about the

189
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,080
vulnerabilities that were used to

190
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,160
exploit these uh holes in their their

191
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,960
code

192
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,280
they shared them with development teams

193
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,199
they brought them to the executive level

194
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,440
the cso was screaming up and down and

195
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
nobody did anything

196
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
so the human cost as we all know it's

197
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,319
hard to find retain train security

198
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,160
talent and

199
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
gone

200
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
very quickly sort of overnight because

201
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,360
they just didn't want to put up with it

202
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
anymore

203
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
of course it also leads to bad publicity

204
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
uber is another one of those companies

205
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,039
where they had a bounty ass data breach

206
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,759
where the cso or cso chief security

207
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,280
officer or sometimes referred to as

208
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,240
chiefs chief scapegoat

209
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,360
said we're going to pay a hundred

210
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,039
thousand dollars to this bounty hunter

211
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,479
in florida

212
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,240
to not release the information from this

213
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
breach

214
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,600
and ultimately that that individual was

215
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,680
fired they were brought up on wire fraud

216
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,319
charges and it cost in just fines alone

217
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,120
148 million us dollars to the company

218
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
that's by the way if you take half of

219
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,440
that

220
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
for a fortune 100 company that's a

221
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,880
pretty good budget for a security year

222
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
just one year right

223
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,319
you probably don't even need say 10 of

224
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,360
that to have a pretty good security

225
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,479
budget in most organizations today

226
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,479
and then there's sort of the interesting

227
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,479
example of zoom people still continue to

228
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,160
use it today and it's sort of wildly

229
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,599
popular because it's free most of the

230
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,039
time for those that use it

231
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,960
but right at the beginning of the

232
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
pandemic january of 2020

233
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,199
it turned out that they did not in fact

234
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,479
have end-to-end encryption like they

235
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,639
were claiming according to the

236
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,479
fcc in the united states

237
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,479
and a series of other vulnerabilities in

238
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,960
their installed software was sort of

239
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,599
piled on top of that now can you imagine

240
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,120
the world is just about to go fully

241
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
remote companies are about to make

242
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,599
multi-million dollar decisions for over

243
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,199
multiple years for the solutions that

244
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,880
they're going to use to now allow for

245
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
people to be fully remote

246
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
and you didn't treat security as a

247
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,440
future

248
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,680
and now the world knows it

249
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,960
people are going to change their mind

250
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,919
about whether or not they're going to

251
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,039
use you or they're going to get a pretty

252
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,759
steep discount in the offing for it so

253
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,039
again

254
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,319
things happen when you don't treat

255
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,080
security as a feature it will eventually

256
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,199
catch up to you and in some cases it has

257
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,319
and it really doesn't have to be this

258
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,199
way

259
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,720
there's whole there's sort of several

260
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,639
layers at which you can approach this

261
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,560
and my original background is in

262
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,639
psychology so i like to go back to the

263
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,280
1990s in new york city in the united

264
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
states where there was sort of this

265
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,840
concept of broken windows theory which

266
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,879
is

267
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,400
you'd have rampant crime throughout the

268
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
city but you saw that if a neighborhood

269
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
had broken windows that were boarded up

270
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,919
with ply board or plywood

271
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
you'd start to see graffiti and as you

272
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,759
start to see graffiti you start to see

273
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,520
drug sales and you start to see drug

274
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
sales receive violence

275
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
and it all started with a broken window

276
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
and in a lot of ways as a software

277
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,680
engineering organization if you fix the

278
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
broken windows

279
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
you sort of stop all of the after

280
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,559
effects that take place

281
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,320
and they they proved this out with the

282
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,000
subway cars that have graffiti all over

283
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
them in new york city they would take

284
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
them out of uh sort of

285
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,279
commission repaint them send them back

286
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,160
out crime went down

287
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
sort of quick fix right same thing can

288
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
happen in your applications if you sort

289
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
of catch things early

290
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,160
sort of go about

291
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
fixing those things early

292
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,519
you can prevent those longer term

293
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
security problems that ultimately crop

294
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
up and then leads to some sort of event

295
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
in your organization

296
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
i also like to say security is unit

297
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
testing my wife taught me how to cook

298
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,800
and the first and most important thing

299
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
let's check your ingredients right no

300
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
matter what recipe you're making if your

301
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,399
ingredients are bad it will taste bad

302
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,640
and possibly make you sick

303
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,600
so

304
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
when you're going about sort of

305
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
starting at security think of it as your

306
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,320
unit testing right everybody always

307
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
thinks about unit testing and software

308
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
development to make sure things are

309
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
working well guess what security can in

310
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
fact be a unit test as well look at

311
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,920
static analysis and i have

312
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
recommendations of some free tools

313
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
available to folks as well on that front

314
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,600
here in a couple of slides but

315
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
just look at the recipe look at your

316
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,519
code and determine what's bad about it

317
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
also look at your supply chain

318
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,279
or dependencies right what sort of

319
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,720
ingredients are you pulling in from open

320
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,200
source like the was a node ipc

321
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
open source project that recently ruined

322
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,080
a lot of people's computers um

323
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
i have sidebar commentary for that that

324
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,920
i will share later over drinks but

325
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
needless to say check your check your

326
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
ingredients check your recipe start

327
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,959
there because it's the earliest place

328
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,720
that you can start to invest in security

329
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,399
other than of course training

330
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
and then begin to treat it like

331
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
integration testing as well a lot of the

332
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
times especially in static analysis if

333
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,839
you're working across micro services

334
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,279
you're going to have an input that makes

335
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,800
it into another part of your application

336
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
that isn't sort of enclosed in that

337
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
micro service that you initially checked

338
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
and it's not treated as bad in the next

339
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,959
microservice when it comes in

340
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,000
so

341
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
as i say throw a spaghetti at the wall

342
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
to see if it sticks it's a great way to

343
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
know that your spaghetti is done

344
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,279
or in this case use fuzzing use dynamic

345
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,640
analysis throw things at your

346
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,399
application to check your mitigations

347
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,600
your controls

348
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
your actual sort of sanity checks inside

349
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,519
of your code to make sure that in fact

350
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,160
yeah this thing is secure

351
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
for example when i went to a hospital

352
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
recently and i had to sign in and put my

353
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,720
birth date in there i hit the backspace

354
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
key too many times then accidentally hit

355
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,480
enter had a buffer underflow suddenly i

356
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
was in a windows xp prompt

357
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
on this in this hospital network and i

358
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,680
was just like

359
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,120
nobody tested that nobody even thought

360
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
that okay maybe if we give it less than

361
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,000
what it's asking for it would be a

362
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,440
problem again throw spaghetti at the

363
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,399
wall fuzzing see what happens

364
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,600
there are a lot of benefits to doing

365
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,399
this

366
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,320
first of all attack complexity increases

367
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
now a lot of organizations continue to

368
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
get breached because of phishing

369
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,720
attempts and they're going after sort of

370
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,440
traditional security vulnerabilities

371
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
but if you look at payouts in the

372
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
zero-day market for a lot of software

373
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,000
especially in the mobile space both

374
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
android and ios it's getting more

375
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
expensive because those companies are

376
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,560
investing in security and so therefore

377
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
exploiting those applications or

378
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,680
exploiting software on a phone is

379
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,480
getting harder it's the likes of the nso

380
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
group that are able to continue to do

381
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
that but again

382
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
very small threat landscape by

383
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,120
comparison which means that the people

384
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,200
that you're worried about attacking you

385
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
are a very specific set of actors and

386
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
they're very they're usually very

387
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
persistent about trying to get you one

388
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,839
way or another

389
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,079
it also differentiates in products uh

390
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,519
the key example i always go back to here

391
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,639
is apple

392
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
while apple has its ups and downs and

393
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,160
patrick wordle of objective c could

394
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,200
point to a number of the different

395
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,880
security vulnerabilities associated with

396
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,040
it it is considered one of the the more

397
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
secure mobile platforms out there by

398
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
default which is a good thing especially

399
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,040
related to privacy we also see this in

400
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
frameworks as well when you look at

401
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,320
react js versus the original angularjs

402
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,560
angularjs had this sort of interesting

403
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
concept of the sandbox well the folks

404
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,880
over at portswigger did a really good

405
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,360
job of finding sandbox escapes

406
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,200
i had the great pleasure of building a

407
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,240
sandbox escape to full reverse shell

408
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
using an angularjs framework with

409
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,519
template injection during a training

410
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
that i've given and again it was because

411
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,920
they treated the sandbox as the sort of

412
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
security thing released it outside i

413
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
think version 1.8 or 1.9 and eventually

414
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,279
they said we're going to scrap the

415
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,200
entire sandbox well that brought it all

416
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,279
the way back to just version 1.1 and you

417
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,720
still had the same vulnerability which

418
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,000
became a breaking change when they

419
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,839
released angular 2

420
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,920
whereas with react they sort of called

421
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
those things right on the face of it you

422
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
want to dangerously set inner html okay

423
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,240
you can

424
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
but it's dangerous and it tells you

425
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
right there that it's dangerous and as a

426
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
security professional kind of very easy

427
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
to grip your code and say yeah this is

428
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,920
dangerous on it are you sure you want to

429
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
be doing that and why are you doing that

430
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,760
and here's how you exploit that

431
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
but

432
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
it really sort of differentiated at the

433
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,079
framework level and the applications

434
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,200
that then were made off of those

435
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
frameworks the sort of security that

436
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,760
could be implemented in them by default

437
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,200
and ultimately that saves you time and

438
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
money because usually when a

439
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
an event occurs you're suddenly dropping

440
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,880
everything all those features that you

441
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,000
were working on the customers were

442
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,320
asking you for now get delayed by

443
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,079
weeks or months

444
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,880
and uh you're suddenly now needing to

445
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
reach out to a mandiant or somebody else

446
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,399
and spending hundreds of thousands or

447
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
millions on

448
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,720
remediation efforts let alone actually

449
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,199
now figuring out how this uh could be

450
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,800
fixed in the long term

451
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,959
so it will eventually cost you something

452
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,720
but small investments made up front tend

453
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,959
to have a bigger payoff over time

454
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,560
so where to get started right as if

455
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
you're in an organization i always say

456
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,839
the things that you actually need to

457
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,519
care about are not necessarily security

458
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,920
related but will have profound and

459
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,240
compounding sort of impacts on the way

460
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
that you implement security

461
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
first your speed of deployment

462
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,800
if it's two weeks it needs to go through

463
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,720
a change review board it needs to be

464
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,360
manually tested and then deployed you

465
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,560
have a problem

466
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,160
because as soon as a security incident

467
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,839
occurs getting that thing out to

468
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,680
production is going to be slow

469
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,959
meaning that the pain is going to

470
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,600
continue until you do that so making

471
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,040
sure that your applications can get out

472
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
into the world quickly and hopefully

473
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
safely super important

474
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,600
next is your breadth of testing the more

475
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
things you test the better the more

476
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,800
tools you're implementing to make sure

477
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,320
that you're sort of getting as much

478
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,880
coverage as you possibly can the better

479
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,639
but of course there is such a thing as

480
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,560
too much so sort of

481
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
fine balance there

482
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,480
then once you've sort of implemented

483
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,839
your speed of deployment making sure

484
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,120
you're including security is part of

485
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,880
that usually it's sort of low overhead

486
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,800
if you get it early on and you get that

487
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,480
breath of testing to sort of test it at

488
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,959
the static analysis initial layers of

489
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,240
putting code into production or putting

490
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,079
code into your repository then you've

491
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,680
got your breadth of testing for dynamic

492
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
or fuzzing and on and on

493
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,040
your mean time to resolution is sort of

494
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
your next best measurement to say how

495
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,399
well are we actually doing it any of

496
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,519
this stuff and i don't mean the won't

497
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,360
fix you know accepting risk sort of

498
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
things but the how quickly does your

499
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,560
team actually recognize that something

500
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
needs to be fixed starts working on that

501
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,920
fix and deploys that fix out to

502
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,959
production

503
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,279
most of the time it's really slow

504
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,639
and part of that is because your speed

505
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,079
of deployment is slow but part of that

506
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,079
is also because it goes to the backlog

507
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,160
or as i say dev null and it never gets

508
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,600
seen again

509
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,279
and so now when you eventually have that

510
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,880
breach or incident that occurs well

511
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
guess what it was in the backlog capital

512
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
one and others

513
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,839
and so that's sort of a good way to

514
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,839
determine how healthy is your

515
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,639
application or software security program

516
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,880
and one of the most important things and

517
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
this is controversial for most companies

518
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,519
but i'll say it which is allocate time

519
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,519
to technical debt and security is just

520
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,040
another form of technical debt at the

521
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,240
end of the day and your development

522
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
teams usually know what is most broken

523
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,759
and should be fixed inside of your

524
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,360
application you need to sort of lean in

525
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
on the security a little bit but i say

526
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
at a minimum 10 of their time four hours

527
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,199
a week should be spent on security

528
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,880
really where you want to be

529
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,120
is 20 of their time or want at least one

530
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,519
day a week sometimes it's a two-week

531
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,440
sprint and sort of you know five sprint

532
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
cycle or what have you

533
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
but again the time investment up front

534
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
made consciously

535
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
makes a profound difference in the

536
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
actual implementation of security in

537
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
your applications without it it's

538
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
constantly running from one emergency to

539
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,079
the next

540
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,000
so free tools to start with

541
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
i will say especially for open source

542
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,839
projects

543
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,920
i work at github full disclosure but

544
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
github does have freely available tools

545
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,440
as part of the advanced security tool

546
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,680
set for open source projects today so

547
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,519
you can use them there are other great

548
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,839
free tools such as semgrep a really neat

549
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,920
tool and a sonar cube

550
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
again all for sort of static analysis

551
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,720
looking at your code at the very

552
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,680
beginning

553
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,519
dynamic analysis the open web

554
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
application security project or owasp

555
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,079
zed attack proxy or zap

556
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,160
really great sort of starter tool if

557
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,919
you're looking to get into some of the

558
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,280
web hacking especially a little bit more

559
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,319
manual but they have some great

560
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,799
automated stuff as well

561
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,799
great tool to get started with

562
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,520
the

563
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,760
let's see here the web attack and audit

564
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,640
framework w3af uh by andreas riancho

565
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
that owl looking symbol also really

566
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,959
great free open source tool to sort of

567
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,319
play around with dynamic analysis

568
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,360
especially good against java

569
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
applications

570
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
then looking at your ingredients that

571
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
you're pulling in your dependency

572
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,400
checking so dependabot or dependency

573
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,720
check by owasp again great tools to sort

574
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,520
of

575
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,840
quickly grab test them

576
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
and then finally secrets management is

577
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,679
one of those sort of banes of most

578
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,600
security people's existence because as

579
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,880
soon as you start to find secrets in

580
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
your code the next thing you need to do

581
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,919
is tell your developers how to solve

582
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,120
those problems

583
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
usually they'll just say well we'll put

584
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,919
it in an operating system environment

585
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,280
variable that is still hard coded

586
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
somewhere and still gets pulled in and

587
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,200
it's like no just use the secrets vaults

588
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
use hashicorp vaults use cyber art

589
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
conjure pull in something and teach them

590
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,679
how to sort of create those api calls to

591
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,679
pull those keys in dynamically so that

592
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,120
you can sort of reset them as you need

593
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,240
to

594
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,360
great tool to make that possible

595
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,880
so if you're looking for further reading

596
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
you'll notice none of these are security

597
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,160
books

598
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
which is actually sort of on purpose

599
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
the very first book and the one that i

600
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,919
kind of constantly go back to is the

601
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,840
devops handbook

602
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,080
read the whole thing

603
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
cover to cover

604
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,200
because part six

605
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
is about security

606
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
with really great security people

607
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,760
implementing and how to sort of put that

608
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,120
in your organization

609
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
the funny thing is is i'm on the record

610
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
of saying that devsecops doesn't exist

611
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
it's just devops it was in the devops

612
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,360
handbook but of course devsecops sells

613
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,080
and it's sort of the um

614
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,480
the newer mantra so eventually because

615
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
it became my title at thermo fisher i

616
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,919
sort of had to embrace it

617
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,760
but great book

618
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,679
if you're sort of more curious about

619
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,679
knowing not only if you are interested

620
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,880
in getting on the manager's path

621
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,919
yourself or sort of how the managers

622
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,520
think about things at different levels

623
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,760
of the organization from sort of a lead

624
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,320
engineer all the way up to a cto the

625
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,919
manager's path does a really good job

626
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,520
sort of walking you through that so you

627
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,440
understand the mentality sort of things

628
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
that they care about

629
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,799
you know as was mentioned in the keynote

630
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,880
as well the sort of risks involved in

631
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
risk-based decision-making that you have

632
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
to come up with

633
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
and then finally lean enterprise the

634
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,440
first half of that book is very much

635
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,120
like the devops handbook in a lot of

636
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
ways the last half of that book is

637
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,840
really where the true gold lies and it's

638
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,679
sort of gives you the idea that

639
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,240
businesses don't exist to be secure i

640
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
know shocking right they don't exist to

641
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,679
be secure they exist to sell you a

642
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,919
product and security is sort of a

643
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,840
byproduct of that

644
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,400
and it gives you a lot of insights into

645
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,480
sort of the hows and whys behind

646
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,679
business decisions how to sort of

647
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
rehash or think about how you want to

648
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,960
sell security back to the business and

649
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,919
it's a really good way to think about

650
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,679
those things

651
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,760
of course special thanks i like to thank

652
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,200
just a few people in my life that have

653
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
really helped me in my career namely

654
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,120
most importantly my wife who couldn't

655
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,360
join me on this trip but um she shares

656
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,640
my time with the rest of the world and

657
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,480
so i always like to send a nice thank

658
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,000
you to her hopefully next time i'll be

659
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,919
able to bring her and have a glass of

660
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,440
champagne or guinness or some some other

661
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,960
such thing

662
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,280
then my sensei and good friend jason

663
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
haddocks who when i was at bug crowd

664
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,039
taught me a whole lot about bug bounty

665
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
hunting and one of the very best human

666
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,559
beings that i know

667
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,240
and then my good friend who recruited me

668
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,559
to thermo fisher and was sort of uh

669
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,840
pushing me to do more which is brian

670
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,280
inagaki um who has again really pushed

671
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,039
me in sort of my career and encouraging

672
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,320
me to do sort of new and crazy things

673
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,760
so with that said it looks like we have

674
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,320
just over um five minutes or so happy to

675
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
you know have any q a now or even after

676
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,080
but um would love to get your questions

677
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,520
happy to provide any sort of perspective

678
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,679
that i can offer uh with the asterisk

679
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,440
that these are my opinions uh not the

680
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
opinions of anyone else or any other

681
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,720
organization that i'm affiliated with so

682
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,360
any questions

683
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,320
hi thank you for the excellent

684
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,000
talk uh if there's one you presented a

685
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,559
bunch of uh security tools over there

686
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,520
that uh

687
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
i'm some of them are familiar with i

688
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,919
will

689
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,559
others i will definitely be looking into

690
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,120
but what do you feel is really missing

691
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,080
from the free security tool uh

692
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,919
landscape right now if you would like

693
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,039
you would

694
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,240
uh

695
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
you would get one wish uh to be

696
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
completed what what what uh tool would

697
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,240
you require someone to build i know

698
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
exactly what i'd ask for um so i'm a

699
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,080
very uh good friend with some of the

700
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,880
folks over at signal sciences who built

701
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,400
just a really wonderful sort of

702
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,799
in-application security firewall

703
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,480
and of course there are free tools out

704
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,039
there today um but the implementation

705
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,120
that they put together to

706
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
just sort of catch things at the

707
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,520
application layer that i'll tell you so

708
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,799
many network-based firewalls just

709
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,480
absolutely missed and it's sort of

710
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
hilarious putting it in and bringing it

711
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,679
behind those and saying you still have

712
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,880
two million attacks you're missing guys

713
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,360
like come on um that's if i had a free

714
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,640
open source tool that i was looking for

715
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,159
that would be it

716
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,039
for sure great question

717
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
yeah

718
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
thank you uh really good presentation

719
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,200
first um

720
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
you mentioned a little bit about

721
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,159
dependencies right like in the case of

722
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
node.js yes but what is your

723
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,000
opinion

724
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
about other languages i think some of

725
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,919
them are very overlooked such as dotnet

726
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,159
uh we don't see too much you know when a

727
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,919
bit is happening there but doesn't

728
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,840
really mean like they are they don't

729
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
have the same issues um i guess from the

730
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,480
node.js perspective is because units is

731
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,559
pretty widely open and

732
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,000
i don't know if that has to do with the

733
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
way it's developed but what is your

734
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,480
opinion about

735
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
other dependencies and the issues that

736
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,679
come along with that

737
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,440
oh yeah i mean in terms of frameworks

738
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,559
and languages you know especially like

739
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,880
python for example right

740
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,039
very large sort of dependency landscape

741
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,440
there net java as well right if you

742
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,360
think of apache struts 2 was made famous

743
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,320
by the experian breach

744
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,159
super important right especially across

745
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,880
the sort of broad ecosystem

746
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
that being said you also sort of had to

747
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
think about from a business perspective

748
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,760
when you're building coverage against

749
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
that and from a sort of the way the

750
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,400
world is going perspective php is still

751
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,799
something like 70 of the internet uh in

752
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,000
terms of all the wordpress sites that

753
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
are out there but

754
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,760
very few people actually develop php on

755
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,960
a daily basis anymore right um so so you

756
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,559
sort of have to measure that

757
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,000
back and forth and say okay does it make

758
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,600
sense to cover these things

759
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
in terms of an exposure i think over

760
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,320
time you know for better or worse

761
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,799
javascript will become sort of the only

762
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,799
language that we see on the web

763
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,559
um i really hate their sort of

764
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,000
laissez-faire use of semicolons but um

765
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,679
again it's it's sort of

766
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,880
i think that that's where a lot of

767
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,760
companies are going is is thinking about

768
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,120
what's being used by the rest of the

769
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
world what's sort of um

770
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,279
going to be up and coming what's still

771
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,039
sort of around i mean even cobalt and

772
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,360
fortran is still used wildly in you know

773
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
banks and other places but nobody thinks

774
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,279
about dependency checking for cobalt or

775
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,120
fortran because well it's on a mainframe

776
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
and you know it's hard to get how to get

777
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,799
those in the first place so

778
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,480
that's sort of a

779
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,279
hand-wavy way of saying yeah javascript

780
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,720
python maybe some java um but

781
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,480
after that it sort of becomes niche you

782
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
know net especially

783
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
it's sort of making a resurgence but not

784
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,919
as much as i say some of the other

785
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,960
languages

786
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,440
great question

787
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
have time for maybe one more yeah

788
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,320
one or two more depends on how fast i

789
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,639
can talk

790
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,880
i suppose i was interested you mentioned

791
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,480
lots of tools and

792
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
um

793
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,400
things you'd like to you you should

794
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,840
include in an application security

795
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,320
program and would you say these would be

796
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,559
you would would these be best done with

797
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,480
a dedicated application security team or

798
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,520
a

799
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,559
is it

800
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,320
do you have kind of a good approach to

801
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,640
how you get the development team itself

802
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,720
to take on these tasks and build it into

803
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
the culture yeah it's an excellent

804
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,600
question that was one of the sort of

805
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,679
first challenges i had at thermo fisher

806
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,000
um so starting with a dedicated team is

807
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
is almost um

808
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
essential because the the sort of idea

809
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,440
is

810
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
what we did

811
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,799
is we had members of that team who would

812
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,360
hold sort of open forum training classes

813
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
every wednesday afternoon at one

814
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,919
one eastern ish to get as much coverage

815
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,600
of time zones and we'd invite

816
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,880
development teams who we had found

817
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,279
vulnerabilities in their code to those

818
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,360
and you'd start to get sort of

819
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,880
one or two interested parties that would

820
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,840
come in

821
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,880
you'd teach them how to do some really

822
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,320
interesting exploitation you sort of

823
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,159
give them access to the tools

824
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,760
and then they'd sort of some of them

825
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,919
caught the bug as we say like they

826
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,200
they'd go back and then they'd start

827
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,799
doing all sort of these implementations

828
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
and then they became sort of champions

829
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
within those teams

830
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
honestly how i expanded my team was than

831
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,320
hiring those people especially the ones

832
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,200
that were really good and really knew

833
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
what they were doing i just bring them

834
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
in and then suddenly they became

835
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,799
part of the program and we expanded from

836
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,640
there and now they were sort of a

837
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
trusted resource right security is sort

838
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,960
of still considered the outsider but if

839
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,720
you have someone who was a developer in

840
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
the team doing those things day to day

841
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,760
knows the applications and suddenly

842
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,600
they're a security person

843
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,760
the developers listen to them

844
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,120
and that's sort of the approach that i

845
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,880
had to take with it is

846
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
think of yourself as a developer build

847
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,640
the tools for them show them the tools

848
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,840
and train them

849
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,799
and

850
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,320
sort of evangelize for lack of a better

851
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,840
term that's that's really but you do

852
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
need a dedicated team i mean

853
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,799
for

854
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,240
3 500 or so developers

855
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,360
today

856
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,679
uh at thermo fisher there was only maybe

857
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,520
a team of eight

858
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
so talking about scale but it was really

859
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,640
because we had all those other champions

860
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,320
so anyway i'm being told that i'm out of

861
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,760
time thank you everyone i'll be around

862
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,039
for a little bit so please feel free to

863
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,919
