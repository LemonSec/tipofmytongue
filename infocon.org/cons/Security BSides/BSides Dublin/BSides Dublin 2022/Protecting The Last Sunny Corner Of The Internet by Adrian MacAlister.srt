of my background and experience and

7

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,880
i've been working now this is my 25th

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,119
year working at nit so a quarter of a

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,560
century so

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,119
the greyhounds do do represent the the

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,160
years of

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
of stress and experience and i t

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,400
17 of those years

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
have been predominantly focused in

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,320
information security

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,920
and i work currently as part of tick

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,880
tock's

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
cspo team which is our chief security

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
and privacy office team and based here

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
in dublin

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
so my background is i spent sort of ten

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,920
years working for caterpillar

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
and i was found a member of their c-cert

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,719
team

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,559
i then spent a few years working for

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,360
aecom and was helping build and mature

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
their incident response capabilities

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,199
i then spent around about four and a

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,760
half years at salesforce

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,840
uh which moved me from dublin i'm sure

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,159
as the accent gives away not not local

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,479
originally from from belfast so moved

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,119
down to dublin for the salesforce role

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,560
and worked there for four and a half

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,360
years

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,799
helping with them with all of their

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,439
critical incidents and cyber security

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,560
issues

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
i've been with ticktock now for the last

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,960
nine months and that one of the things

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
that really excited me about coming to

43
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,360
work for for the platform was know the

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,040
company mission statement which is the

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
inspire creativity

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,439
and bring joy and you know being part of

47
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,840
a a team that helps protect the platform

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,079
which helps achieve that that goal was

49
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,360
something that was really really

50
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,640
interested in

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
um so the agenda anyway for today i'm

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,920
going to go through some of the

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,240
characters that we face against

54
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,320
how we prioritize security

55
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
defense in depth

56
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,240
i'm talking about our dublin fusion

57
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
center something incredibly excited to

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
talk about and share

59
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
some of the challenges with kovid and

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
how we've had to grow

61
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
like exponentially remotely building

62
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,680
teams and relationships all remotely

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
without ever meeting anybody in person

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
which is extremely challenging when

65
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,758
you're trying to build relationships and

66
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,080
then our path through to trust and

67
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
transparency

68
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
so as i mentioned though tick tock

69
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
platform to inspire creativity bring joy

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,120
but anywhere on the internet that has

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,879
something that's used for good there's

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,160
always going to be people out there

73
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,400
looking to find ways to do bad stuff on

74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
that platform

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
so you can see that some of the things

76
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
that we're up against are

77
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
state sponsored actors

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
gonna have misinformation disinformation

79
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,760
and

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,280
the motivation is to try and sort of

81
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
gain some sort of narrative or so

82
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
discord uh with with a subject matter

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
organized crime

84
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
you can have no financial gain people

85
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
looking to you know make money from from

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,280
the platform and exploit sensitive

87
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,319
information from our tick tock users

88
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,640
and then the terrorism

89
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,879
and then the hackers you know people

90
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,680
looking to get information that's

91
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
about users what we're doing looking to

92
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,159
spread malicious content for the

93
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,200
platform

94
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,879
as well and

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,480
causing damage to

96
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,200
people as well

97
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
so in order to help try and protect

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
against all of those different fret

99
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
factors now some of the things that

100
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,760
we're doing here is the prioritizing

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
security based on a lot of our core

102
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,440
principles so

103
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
it's obviously installing a security

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
culture to enable our our people as the

105
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,239
first line of defense which is the same

106
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,400
regardless of where you work is

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,720
our people our users our employees

108
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
are always our first line of defense so

109
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
we're building those strong foundations

110
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,599
having our security team uh compromised

111
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
of industry experts know people very

112
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,159
long tenured backgrounds and diverse

113
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,760
experience in the private and public

114
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
sector have came along to try and help

115
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,319
protect the the platform and all of our

116
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,519
users

117
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,280
and expand in our capabilities and reach

118
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,519
globally like all of you as i'm sure

119
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
have seen the

120
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,680
the exponential growth of tick tock and

121
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
and the platform and with that we need

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
to grow as well as as a team so we're

123
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,200
expanding our footprint in washington

124
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,519
mountain through singapore and dublin

125
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,920
ireland so which has me here today now

126
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,959
dublin

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,040
is one of our regional

128
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,680
centers of excellence for for cyber

129
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,759
uh we are here obviously at a booth for

130
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
actively haran and if you want to come

131
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,199
chat with me at the booth afterwards you

132
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,280
can see some of the exciting roles that

133
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
we have that that cover around how we

134
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
protect our users and the platform

135
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,720
and we're building a state-of-the-art

136
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,479
monitor and response and investigative

137
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
fusion center and i will touch more on

138
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,960
what the fusion centers are

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,639
later on in the slides it's something

140
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,199
i'm incredibly excited and passionate

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,680
about to be involved in and

142
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,199
i think it's pretty cool as well some of

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,880
the some of the different threat factors

144
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
that we see in

145
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
issues cross-functional with different

146
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,840
areas

147
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
and then enabling partnerships with

148
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,759
world leading cyber securities firms for

149
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,360
herbal touch and some of the later

150
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,960
slides on some of the other

151
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
organizations that we're working with

152
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,759
to help improve the the security of of

153
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,440
the platform and you can see that

154
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
obviously we adhere to

155
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
a lot of security standards like nist uh

156
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,960
cfs csf iso 2701 sock 2 and all the

157
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,800
usual industry standard controls that

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
you'd expect

159
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,840
so with anything doing security well

160
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,400
you need to have defense in depth and we

161
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
use that for multiple layers of

162
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
different methodologies

163
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,759
and the first being on platform defense

164
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,080
though as a mentioned we've got

165
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,639
exponential growth you know there was a

166
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,720
stat released last month where we had

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,560
like a billion monthly active users

168
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
which is just crazy scale

169
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
of numbers and volumes that that we're

170
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
seeing on the platform of of monthly

171
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,880
active users so

172
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,039
that's not a problem you can really have

173
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,440
people throughout so you have to have

174
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,199
machine learning automated monitoring

175
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
tools to track anomalous and authentic

176
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,400
behavior and take that content off the

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,240
platform if it gets to the platform or

178
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
stop it reach into the platform before

179
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,160
it ever gets uploaded to a tick tock

180
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
video

181
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,759
and then like by design we're building

182
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,960
security

183
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
integration into all of our tools and

184
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
our development life cycles and

185
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,639
everything that we produce

186
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
if you've been in any offices where

187
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,039
you've seen all of the the the

188
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,800
the posters that you get where it says

189
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,360
like quality and security is like a

190
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,120
swimming pool you can't add the water in

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
afterwards so the same with security you

192
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,960
can't add that in afterwards it needs to

193
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,199
be integrated into the beginning of all

194
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,680
the development creation of all of the

195
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,319
designs and products

196
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,360
then with platform controls we we use a

197
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
methodology of over the horizon threat

198
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
defense so looking forward and trying to

199
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,440
determine what threats are going to be

200
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
effectiveness and making sure we're

201
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,639
building in all of the appropriate

202
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
global for monitoring tools and

203
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
processes

204
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,639
the real deal of that and then the other

205
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
controls to define and implement measure

206
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
controls to protect data including i am

207
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,759
idm obviously that's a few examples

208
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,560
there's

209
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
quite a quite a large list of different

210
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
controls that we use but that's a few

211
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,520
ones and then obviously user data

212
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
the hardened the center of defense

213
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
in-depth model focuses on protecting our

214
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
user data we want the platform to be a

215
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,960
safe place

216
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
where people feel they can be their own

217
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,440
authentic self produce content produce

218
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,639
videos and have fun on the platform

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,400
and we feel that people can do that best

220
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,479
if they actually feel safe with the

221
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,319
content that they're putting onto the

222
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,800
platform

223
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,199
and a question i get asked a lot

224
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,840
is now where is your data stored how is

225
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,599
data going around the world and stuff

226
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,599
like that so one of the things at tiktok

227
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,520
we do a lean localization strategy on

228
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,080
where we store data so currently we have

229
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,240
uh data centers in the united states

230
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
data centers in

231
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,039
singapore

232
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,800
and we've also made the commitment on

233
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
creating the data center in dublin

234
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
ireland so

235
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,639
incredibly incredibly exciting to see

236
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,840
the focus

237
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
and investment in in ireland as well as

238
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,840
as wider europe

239
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,199
so as i mentioned

240
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,599
in dublin we're building a fusion center

241
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,120
and the the concept of a fusion center

242
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,639
a lot of folks when i've said i'm

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,080
working in the fusion center i'm the

244
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
fusion center lead they're like no

245
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,599
adrian what what does this fusion center

246
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,560
thing

247
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,399
that you're talking about so the way i

248
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,559
try and sort of explain the fusion

249
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
center it's it's all hazards incident

250
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,279
management collaboration so

251
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,799
typically in organizations and i am

252
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,479
going to be annoying and ask people to

253
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
give me a show of hands but like how

254
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,920
many times have you been involved in a

255
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
security incident

256
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,839
where it's been two or three weeks later

257
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,480
and you only find out about the incident

258
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
because like somebody has just thought

259
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,920
well well maybe we should tell the

260
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
security guys that this thing has

261
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
happened

262
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
which is real the fusion center the

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
whole idea and philosophy of that is to

264
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
bring all of the sort of usual dispersed

265
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
silo teams together in one room

266
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,519
and if you've like watched likes of the

267
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,120
csi miami and you see like the

268
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
government rooms with the big video

269
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,760
screens and you know the

270
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,360
multi-departmental sort of capabilities

271
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
that gives us that sort of same

272
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,120
capability

273
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
for our environment so you can see like

274
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
all the different names of the different

275
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
teams

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,959
that we're going to have co-located in

277
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
all of these fusion center rooms so i

278
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,040
could be working on an incident or i

279
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,560
could be just in the fusion center

280
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,279
somebody could mention that there's a

281
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,440
fire at a data center somewhere or

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
there's an earthquake in japan or

283
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
there's a active shooter situation

284
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
somewhere and i'm going to be able to

285
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,680
quickly know how that spans across all

286
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,480
the different teams groups and how to

287
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,160
respond all of that those types of

288
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
incidents to best protect our employees

289
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,120
our platform and and our users so

290
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,200
it's something incredibly excited to be

291
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
involved in and and work in and get to

292
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,519
see the sort of large wide span of

293
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,600
different incident types that occur so

294
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,519
you've got

295
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,399
legal

296
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,760
privacy

297
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
data defense

298
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
no actual physical security cyber

299
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
security

300
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
cyber threat intelligence you know all

301
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
of those teams are really actively

302
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
collaboratively working together now on

303
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,040
a

304
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,320
real real common ground and

305
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
so it really makes the agility and and

306
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
ability to respond the incidents much

307
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
more

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,279
quickly and effective

309
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,000
so with the fusion center our goal is to

310
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,839
now have that next generation cyber

311
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,600
threat monitor and so we have that as i

312
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
mentioned holistic you know all hazards

313
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,519
incident management perspective

314
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,600
of all of our incidents

315
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,320
we use the private and public cyber

316
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,120
investigations and digital crimes groups

317
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,279
and advancements on our platform threat

318
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
discovery to protect our community

319
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
which really like as i mentioned it

320
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
really leads to more efficient

321
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,000
operations so

322
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
like our time to identify attempt to

323
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,760
contain time the eradicate time to

324
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,399
recover is all greatly reduced because

325
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
of our greater efficiencies of all

326
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,680
working together in a much more

327
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,719
collaborative way

328
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,920
and so as i mentioned our data centers

329
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,680
and you can see the alignment of the

330
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,600
data centers on our regional

331
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
centers of excellence so

332
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,440
with the fusion centers that we're

333
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,760
building in dublin we're also have those

334
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,880
in dc

335
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,360
and also in singapore and that allows us

336
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,760
to operate at a 24 7 follow the sun

337
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
support model so we can run

338
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
incidents and issues throughout the day

339
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
from singapore to dublin

340
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,120
back to dc back to singapore back to

341
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,279
dublin back to dc so we've got that

342
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,040
fluid operations of all of the our

343
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
incident management work through

344
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
you know 27

345
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
uh 24 7 period

346
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
we're branding internally all of the

347
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
fusion centers as fuse

348
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,399
so that's that's what we call ourselves

349
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
internally as as the as the fuse team

350
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
and from early

351
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
2021 we've been building and

352
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,560
making that capability um you know into

353
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,839
the real world

354
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,680
fusion centers where we have folks

355
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
located and working to

356
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,519
run incidents

357
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
and obviously unless you've been living

358
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,760
under a rock for the last few years you

359
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,959
might have heard of this thing called

360
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,200
covid that's been kicking around that

361
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,279
caused a problem or two with uh meeting

362
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,040
in person

363
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
so like any any type of

364
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,000
no cross team cross-functional thing

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
though it's a lot of hearts and minds of

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
winning over people relationship

367
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,040
building

368
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,639
and doing all that type of thing

369
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,079
remotely

370
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,079
is incredibly challenging they're trying

371
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
to build those relationships and and

372
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,519
those those

373
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,839
close partnerships with folks all on the

374
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,240
side other side of the screen is is much

375
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
more challenging so that's one of the

376
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,959
things that we've been extremely

377
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,160
successful

378
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
in doing that and building all of those

379
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,760
relationships amongst all of the

380
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,440
different teams

381
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,519
so the xfn experience there if you don't

382
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,519
know what the abbreviation is it's

383
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,320
cross-functional network so

384
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,600
we've built

385
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
all of those relationships as you've

386
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
seen on one of the previous slides of

387
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,440
all of our different partner teams legal

388
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
finance new

389
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,200
physical security cti cyber threat and

390
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
we've been working tremendously closely

391
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
together and building all of those

392
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,360
relationships and one of the other

393
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
advantages is then we're all operating

394
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560
on a common operation model so

395
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,079
if something has a high severity

396
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,839
incident in one team

397
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,760
that cross-correlates to what high

398
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,120
severity is in another team though

399
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,920
that's the same language of incidences

400
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,760
the same understanding of what's

401
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
critical what's high what's medium

402
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,720
what's low

403
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,839
and it

404
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,480
allows us to have that sort of

405
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,560
rapid approach to be able to respond to

406
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,240
things in that commonality of being able

407
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000
to do things consistently across the

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
board

409
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,199
as part of the fusion center we've been

410
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,199
doing a lot of great work on the

411
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,079
forensics uh doing dashboards analytics

412
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
metrics so you can also

413
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
see what we're doing see the metrics

414
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
drive improvement and understand

415
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,399
how we can do things better

416
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
and as i mentioned no the hybrid

417
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,199
approach

418
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,360
we're working with multi-function teams

419
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,920
r d legal privacy operations trust and

420
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,279
security internally

421
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,600
but as well from from a hybrid approach

422
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,920
we don't just work hybridly and

423
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
cross-functionally internally we also

424
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,760
look out to the industry our users

425
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,079
and the and folks within the industry so

426
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,000
the the screenshot you see here is a

427
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
little snippet from the tick tock tick

428
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,519
tock app

429
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,360
where you can actually report a security

430
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,600
vulnerability from from the app so it

431
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,199
gives our user base from the touch of

432
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,760
their hands the ability to make us aware

433
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
of a security vulnerability

434
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
we also work with a lot of leading

435
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
external parties

436
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
to help verify and review

437
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
code applications make sure everything

438
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
is secure

439
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,959
validate all of our controls or all of

440
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,199
our technologies to make sure it's best

441
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,040
in class for the industry

442
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,360
we're also incredibly proud to partner

443
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,519
with hacker one for bug bounty program

444
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,320
so

445
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
we can utilize

446
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
external security researchers who can

447
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,000
perform research on the platform

448
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
identify vulnerabilities before the bad

449
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,160
guys do allows us to address and

450
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,079
remediate those so

451
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,320
we do a lot of cross-functional

452
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
internally

453
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,079
and externally

454
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,680
one of the other things we heavily

455
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,920
utilize is a perfect intelligence and

456
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,759
and use it as a force multiplier as you

457
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,000
mentioned as i mentioned earlier

458
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,040
trying to do things in a manual no human

459
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,079
centric

460
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,320
process is extremely difficult and

461
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,560
doesn't scale to the volume of

462
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
of data that we're working with so

463
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
we have a lot of anomalous activity

464
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,759
detection

465
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
where we can see things happening we

466
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,000
have advanced libraries that feed into

467
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,399
our systems converged intelligence

468
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,839
counter measures and then the security

469
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,360
automation that reacts to all of those

470
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,759
intel feeds that come in that allows us

471
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,440
to leverage and make better business

472
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,199
decisions to help protect the community

473
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,759
so we have a foundation of security um

474
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
and we're committed to earning the trust

475
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,600
of our of our community like i mentioned

476
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,920
earlier no it's a platform to inspire

477
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
creativity

478
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
and bring joy and we

479
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,800
genuinely believe that people will do

480
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
that in a place where they feel safe

481
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
so how do we make people feel safe you

482
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,440
know making sure they have a quality

483
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,959
product

484
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,000
that we have

485
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,199
collaborating with security law

486
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,440
enforcement privacy experts to protect

487
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
our global community and making sure

488
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
that the platform is safe

489
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
and empowering users with choice

490
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,440
so as a user of a platform you can

491
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
choose if you want to be private if you

492
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,720
want to be public how your data can be

493
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,959
viewed and seen by others so making sure

494
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,880
folks know how that can be done

495
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
correctly so they can

496
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,079
they'll have that choice of how they

497
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,680
want their data to be seen on on

498
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,519
platform

499
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,440
providing access to code and systems to

500
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,199
validate security controls by third

501
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,320
parties so

502
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,519
a lot of

503
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,160
strong strong controls around access

504
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
validation review with transparency

505
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,679
centers where we allow people to come

506
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,039
and actually view

507
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,480
our code and things like that to

508
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,880
validate that it does what it says it

509
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,000
does

510
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
and though as i mentioned consistency

511
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,599
with the wide range of cross-functional

512
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,119
support teams

513
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
and fusion centers we're working across

514
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,439
a wide base of different teams doing

515
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,919
things consistently same no incident

516
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,480
response language so we can keep

517
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
the consistency of how we respond the

518
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,240
incidents but also keeping our users

519
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
informed of updates and how we enhance

520
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,799
security

521
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
so as i mentioned we offer a wide range

522
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,679
of privacy and security settings that

523
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,280
users can activate during the account

524
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,120
setup or any time afterwards so if you

525
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,039
create a tick tock account you want to

526
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,400
be public you want to share all of the

527
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
information that you have and then

528
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,919
you'll later change your mind you can go

529
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,760
in and change that

530
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,080
we've run cyber security months where

531
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,919
we've tried to do security awareness

532
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,600
their user base to make them aware of

533
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,520
how to use the platform securely as well

534
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,919
as other ways they can enhance their own

535
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,480
security outside of out of the platform

536
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
so we've done that through in-app safety

537
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,039
and security videos

538
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,120
we offer resources and tools for parents

539
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
as well to better oversee their child's

540
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,760
online experience so as a parent

541
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,200
you can have a sort of feel a bit of

542
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,799
assurance of knowing what your child is

543
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,039
actually doing on platform

544
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,640
and we obviously you know frequently

545
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,960
update our security and privacy help

546
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,120
with tips and resources on how to use

547
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,919
the platform securely and

548
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,679
and as i mentioned the

549
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,760
inspire creativity bring joy is that is

550
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
the mission statement of of the company

551
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,720
and

552
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
keeping everybody safe so

553
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
that's the the intent is we hope it can

554
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,720
help inspire creativity and bring joy to

555
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
all of our our users and the content of

556
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,600
the

557
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,159
they create

558
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,039
so just to to finish

559
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
tech talk is focused on protecting our

560
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,360
users but that should hopefully become

561
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,559
clear

562
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,799
from everything they've said and scaling

563
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,200
our global teams to try and match the

564
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,280
scale of of growth within the platform

565
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
as well so we've a global team of

566
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,919
security experts that deliver best in

567
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,440
class capabilities

568
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
and the importance of our work is that

569
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,679
no the job is never done though it's

570
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,400
constant iterative improvement of being

571
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,799
better tomorrow than what we are today

572
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,720
better today than what we were

573
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,480
yesterday so

574
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
that is the completion of my talk i'm

575
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,960
happy to take questions from anybody for

576
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,760
the next three minutes

577
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,200
any questions guys

578
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,120
yes absolutely

579
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,840
thanks adrian great talk um content

580
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,160
moderation um there are a lot of social

581
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,280
media companies doing this

582
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,240
and

583
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,600
a lot of social media companies

584
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
struggling with what is a

585
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,640
a challenge um to solve technically

586
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,600
and a lot of social media companies seem

587
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
to throw eyes on glass

588
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,960
at this problem

589
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,120
you know and more content moderators

590
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
how does tech talk approach this problem

591
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
you know is it something you need to

592
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
scale to or is there a technical

593
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,760
solution that tick-tock bring to bear on

594
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
content promotion yeah so some of the

595
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,200
some of the things i mentioned in in the

596
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
chapter was like you know that that sort

597
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,000
of

598
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
leaning to machine learning and using

599
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
technology to do what technology does

600
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,960
best which is repeatable continual the

601
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,080
process at crazy scale that people can't

602
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,799
do

603
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,480
and then embed that with our cyber

604
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
threat intelligence our intel feeds and

605
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,400
all of this sort of like no attribution

606
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
of what we see

607
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,679
if it's like a miss and disinformation

608
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,080
type of campaign they're collecting all

609
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,039
of the

610
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,559
indicators that are

611
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
similar to that and then detect it

612
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,640
before it gets to the platform even and

613
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,760
shut it off

614
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,200
if it does get onto the platform get it

615
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,720
taken down quickly for all of those

616
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,200
detection mechanisms

617
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,400
i uh just have a quick question on like

618
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,039
say digital forensics and the processing

619
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,520
of imagery and video on your platform

620
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,000
how you're tackling that at the moment

621
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,039
you know

622
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,840
in terms of its uh increase of the

623
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
content you know sorry could you repeat

624
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,960
the question didn't get to hear the

625
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,880
start of it and so with digital

626
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,600
forensics uh you know with the video and

627
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
the imagery on the platform at the

628
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
moment and the observation of images and

629
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,919
such uh are you looking at specific ways

630
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,000
to tackle this problem right now

631
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,919
yeah there's there's many different ways

632
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,159
like both both automated and obviously

633
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
manual review of seeing how different

634
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,120
threat actors try and absolutely

635
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,720
absolutely care our detection

636
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,360
methodologies obviously i can't go into

637
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
some of the elaborate details of what

638
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,480
fret actors are doing the trans

639
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
circumnavigate that and how we're

640
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,679
dealing with that but we've absolutely

641
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,720
seen

642
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,559
you know campaigns and things where

643
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,600
there's some of that that's been

644
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
happening and you know building the

645
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,520
detections and and processes to deal

646
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,360
with that is something that we've done

647
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,600
very successfully

648
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:18,180
[Music]

649
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
cheers

650
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,080
um

651
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,679
interested in your experience hiring

652
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,120
here in ireland as you've been building

653
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,240
out the team

654
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
do you think there is a gap or a

655
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
shortage in the market and if there is

656
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,039
sort of at what level at what area what

657
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,320
have you seen of that

658
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
yes so some of the statistics i've seen

659
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
around unemployment in cyber security i

660
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
think the last step that i read was that

661
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,200
we're minus four percent unemployment in

662
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,919
in security so as an industry wide like

663
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
globally not even in ireland

664
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,760
it's an issue the world over where there

665
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,559
is a shortage of cyber skills so some of

666
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,400
the ways i've historically dealt with

667
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,080
that is i have having intern programs

668
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
developing people apprenticeship

669
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,640
programs

670
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,880
come into these types of conferences

671
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,840
building the contacts with folks because

672
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
as many of you know security folks

673
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,679
have several layers of tin foil hats of

674
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,679
paranoia so they don't

675
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,240
always be on social network platforms so

676
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
uh trying to find people on different

677
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,159
social network platforms to find talent

678
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,320
doesn't really know a scalable effort

679
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
either so they'll find in the payment

680
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,480
coming the conferences go into different

681
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,640
things like that has been very effective

682
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
for me to find folks but engaging with

683
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
universities trying to sort of build and

684
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,640
develop pipeline and stuff and

685
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,080
i'm very passionate

686
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
about and trying to help drive and fill

687
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
talent but there's definitely is a

688
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
shortage of of talent in the industry

689
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,760
globally not just ireland

690
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,880
yep

691
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,559
[Music]

692
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,520
um

693
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,039
the question um is about the map about

694
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,039
house divide that they

695
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,760
i think the data center before it was uh

696
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,120
for us was uh all the world

697
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,880
in indonesia was about

698
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
only the

699
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,919
the

700
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,720
the asia the area east

701
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,039
like

702
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
japan hong kong

703
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,320
this kind of country and the china is

704
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,360
not

705
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,400
in

706
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,039
in need of that

707
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,440
some reason for

708
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,200
threat modeling or is a business

709
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
reason to

710
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,039
to have a debt division yeah so the the

711
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,159
data storage is in singapore and and dc

712
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,760
currently and we've made the commitment

713
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,480
to store it in our data in dublin as

714
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,279
well with the creation of a data center

715
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,039
it's really just that's no

716
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,880
focus at echoes on where we're having

717
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,039
our regional centers of excellence so

718
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,400
our cyber rep center of excellence for

719
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,000
us is dc

720
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,840
singapore for aipac and dublin for so it

721
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,159
just really models where we're focusing

722
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,960
all of our people and resources

723
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,240
because china was not

724
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,840
in

725
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,080
nader in the yeah

726
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
that's correct tick tock doesn't operate

727
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
in china you can't download the app or

728
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
use the app we don't store data in china

729
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,080
there's no data sent to china it's all

730
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,400
stored in the u.s is enough to use it in

731
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,320
china correct yeah yeah you can't you

732
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,480
can't you can't use the tick tock app

733
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
there's no data sent to china stored in

734
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,919
china it's all stored separately so

735
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,400
tick tock is all outside of of china

736
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
rest of world and so it's you know u.s

737
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,080
singapore and

738
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,360
shortly dublin as well okay thanks
