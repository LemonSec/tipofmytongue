00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,680
bootstrap being your cyber education

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,960
um i'm a lecturer with a cyber security

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
director with ucd professional academy

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,879
and i've also started my own company

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,800
fortify institute

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,000
so my own

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,480
cyber journey and

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,680
i've always

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,079
worked in tech i started as an

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
electrician 25 or more years ago

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,680
and then i went into education and

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,199
i t training

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,119
and about

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,560
and that's why i stayed there for a

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
while and then a few years ago i decided

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
i wanted to change and that change was

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
to move into cyber security

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
so i took a master's and then i also

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
completed a lot of the courses i'm going

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,479
to talk about this morning so i do have

36
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,320
that insight as well

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,720
and the other thing as

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
as the lecturer one of the

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
at the end of the the courses i do i

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
always have a session with

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
with my students about where they want

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,079
to go next and i tell them about these

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,200
different courses and they're always

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
surprised that they're they're there

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
that they're free that they're

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,600
accredited they're supported and they're

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
accessible from ireland and most of them

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,079
are flexible and especially with um the

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,680
impact of covet

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
it's made these courses even more

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,560
accessible okay so there's a lot of um

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
benefits of pros

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
and the other thing

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
is we all are aware of the

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,159
the global cyber security

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,600
skills gap

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,639
and

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,200
cyber cyber ireland did a survey

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,920
last year and they identified that um

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,800
nearly half of the roles as their cyber

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
security roles aren't being filled

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,200
so there is a huge skills gap and

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,040
because of that there is a lot of a lot

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
of funding going in to

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
cyber security courses in particular our

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,720
skills needed by and the cyber security

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
security industry in general okay so and

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
that's good

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,599
good for us

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,200
um

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,160
yeah i'm often asked this question about

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
skills versus qualifications

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
uh and what i always say is

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
it depends okay we all know people who

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,440
have

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,840
brilliant skills they're great at pen

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
tests and they're brilliant developers

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
but they don't have the qualifications

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
and then we also know people who may

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,680
have lots of qualifications but if you

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,080
don't lose your skills you lose them

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
and and what

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,000
i'd say it does depend it depends where

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,840
you are in your career and where you

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,959
want to go

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,680
bigger organizations will look for those

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
um bits of paper

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
smaller organizations may be happy

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
enough if you can if you can do the job

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,519
so it does just depend what i'm going to

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
show you today

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,480
is

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,319
it's

94
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,640
college isn't for everyone okay

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
being able to invest three or four years

96
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,799
full time

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
isn't um isn't ideal for everyone some

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,959
people aren't don't have the

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,159
um

100
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,840
there's barriers to them maybe they

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
can't afford maybe their young parents

102
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,120
maybe

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,319
they actually can't access and

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,159
physically access the college like we've

105
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
counties in this country that don't have

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
um colleges

107
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,400
so what i'm going to show you as well is

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,439
courses where you can get um quick

109
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,720
you don't have to invest too much time

110
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
but you can get qualified and get

111
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
started on your career

112
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,519
are if you're in your career you can um

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
either diversify or improve on your

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,879
career prospects

115
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,760
so oh yeah what i wanted to say was

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,720
this

117
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,599
this talk came from an article i wrote

118
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,160
last year about about this very thing

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918
and i i compiled all the different

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
resources and i popped them up on my on

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,520
my socials you can have a look

122
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
um but i didn't want to just stand up

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,040
here today and start listing

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
and a load of links that's no fun for

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
anybody so what i've done is i've come

126
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,919
up with five personas and each of the

127
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,759
personas is somebody at a different

128
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,080
stage of their security career

129
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,720
and hopefully you'll um identify with at

130
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
least at least one of them okay

131
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,960
so first off we're going to look at anna

132
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,520
and anna is at the start of her career

133
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,199
she's she's young she's not showing a

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,880
couple years out of school

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
and she has skills but they're all

136
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,520
self-taught college isn't for her and

137
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
there's certain barriers there that she

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
and she can't afford to go and and she

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
can't afford to do part-time

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,680
so what i would say to anna first off is

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
go on have a look at

142
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,759
fetchcourses.ie

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,440
fetchcore study is a database of the

144
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240
further education courses available in

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,360
ireland

146
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,039
and these courses are available to

147
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
anyone over 16 and since covert a lot of

148
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,440
them are online so

149
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
the courses are offered by your their

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,960
etb your local um

151
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
your local education and training board

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
and before we used to be restricted to

153
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
the courses in our area but now because

154
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,759
they're online we can access courses

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,800
anywhere so if anna goes on to

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
fetch courses and searches for cyber

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,720
what you'll find is that um bald oil

158
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
training center is offering a

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,039
a cyber security analyst course it's the

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,680
comptia one she can do it a couple of

161
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,840
nights a week it's all online and she

162
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
gets the

163
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,560
she can do the the exam as well and it's

164
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
completely free okay

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,199
um if that doesn't suit her maybe she's

166
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
not available those nights she can go on

167
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
to eat college study ecollege again is

168
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,680
government funded

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
it's available to everyone especially

170

here we have david so david's about five

237
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
years into his career he works as a

238
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,640
cyber security consultant and he wants

239
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,519
to

240
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,519
um he wants to progress in his career

241
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,959
you want he's getting a bit pigeonholed

242
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,680
so he wants to get a few more skills

243
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
and he also wants to get ready for a

244
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
management role so what i would say to

245
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,880
david is get on to the the fetch.ie and

246
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
what he'll see is bald oil are offering

247
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,720

248
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,200
advanced security and practitioner

249
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
course and you can start that today

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,120
completely free and do the exams and

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
it's supported

252
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,600
and

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
if that doesn't suit him he can go on to

254
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
e-college e-college have system in

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
training the programming training but

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
another the thing that might be good for

257
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
david is project management training so

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,360
we can go on to e-college and start

259
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,920
doing prints too okay

260
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,560
and springboard is another one of what i

261
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
call the best-kept secrets and

262
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
springboard is a government-funded

263
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
initiative

264
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,279
most colleges and universities in the

265
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,839
country offer springboard courses

266
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
ideally or not ideally but they are

267
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,800
offered for graduates but when they say

268
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
graduates it's not you don't have to

269
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
have a level seven or a level eight

270
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,000
degree

271
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
you can have a level six

272
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
and they also look at your your prior

273
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,760
learning and education so don't think if

274
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
you haven't got a degree you can't do

275
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
springboard but springboard offer wide

276
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
range of courses they're all focused on

277
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
industry needs but they do have cyber

278
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,880
security courses

279
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,680
um

280
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
originally springboard were just for job

281
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
seekers now anybody would anybody who's

282
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
working can access springboard you just

283
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,519
pay 10

284
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,959
so what that means is you can get a

285
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,079
degree or a master's for about 400 euro

286
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,200
okay

287
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,920
so have a look at that they

288
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
they're sort of limited with numbers but

289
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
i've done loads of i've done three

290
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
springboard courses at this point and so

291
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,800
check it out

292
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
cyber skills started off last year it's

293
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
an initiative it's another

294
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,440
government-funded initiative where four

295
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
universities have come together and

296
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
they're working with industries to come

297
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,480
up with and targeted pathways and micro

298
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,360
credentials in the areas that we need in

299
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
cyber security

300
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,560
this the courses are suited to i t

301
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
people who are in it already but they

302
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
just want to get particular cyber skills

303
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
so for

304
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,079
david they do a secure coding and

305
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,200
pathway which might be useful for okay

306
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,880
cyber skills isn't free that's the only

307
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,279
thing but mostly usually it's employers

308
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,959
that pay for it

309
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,680
if you wanted something quick i would

310
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,000
say today would have a look at ccsk it's

311
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,839
a certificate of cloud security

312
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,720
knowledge and this is offered by csa's

313
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,480
cloud security alliance

314
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
you can go on and the course content

315
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
textbooks completely free you can do the

316
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,640
exam for about 350 and it's a one-off

317
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,560
you don't have to maintain it

318
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,800
and i'm just conscious of time now we're

319
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,560
good okay

320
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,519
so

321
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,079
here we have the managers okay with evan

322
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,160
and alice and i see a lot of evans evan

323
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,839
is the manager who isn't an i.t guy

324
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,760
what is at the moment his

325
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,839
his hair is on fire he's

326
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,480
he's been told he has to sort it out

327
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
with regards to cyber security but he

328
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,079
just doesn't know where to start

329
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,880
and what i would say to evan is have a

330
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
look at springboard depending on where

331
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
he's coming from but have a look at

332
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,839
springboard

333
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,920
have a look at e college but the one i

334
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,839
would ex direct evan to is collaboratory

335
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,000
so collaboratory is the cyber security

336
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,880
hub at tu dublin and they're like a

337
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,959
think tank research group but they also

338
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,600
have done research to identify that this

339
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,720
is a big

340
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,399
gap in training

341
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,200
the likes of non-tech managers so

342
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,240
they're putting together a series of

343
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
training and these would be sort of

344
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,839
one-off couple of hours training

345
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,079
and that's where so we'd find out like

346
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,320
sort of where do i start so um with

347
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
regards to evan like what are my assets

348
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,279
what are my what are the threats what

349
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,639
are the vulnerabilities and what

350
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,399
controls can i put in place and also

351
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,320
maybe what framework should i be looking

352
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,519
at okay

353
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,399
so that would that would help evan out

354
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,440
alice on the other hand is an i.t

355
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,920
manager so she's she's up to speed on on

356
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,839
the cyber security side of things but

357
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,160
she's more concerned about her team so

358
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,480
how do she get her team up to speed and

359
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
make sure that they have all the

360
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,079
training they need to carry out their

361
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,720
role in a secure way

362
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,440
so alice can go on to go to cyber skills

363
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,920
they will work with employers as well

364
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,959
about putting the training together

365
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,920
and skillsnet also work with employers

366
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,959
and skillsnet offer a wide range of

367
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,279
courses and they work with

368
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,279
individual training providers the

369
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
courses aren't free with skillsnet but

370
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,839
they are heavily subsidized great value

371
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,160
for courses on there and you can and you

372
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,480
can anybody can access them

373
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,199
um okay so that's the managers

374
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,639
so last we have esther now esther i have

375
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,320
a soft spot for esther she's the one i

376
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
relate to most

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,639
um esther is what we call a returner

378
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,920
okay so esther has taken a break um

379
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
and returners

380
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,720
tend to be

381
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
tech people who have taken a break from

382
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
their career for two or more years

383
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,199
maybe they've gone traveling maybe

384
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,040
they've been sick

385
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
um or maybe they have caring

386
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,120
responsibilities and whatever reason

387
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,680
they've taken that break now esther has

388
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,279
taken the break because she's been

389
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,040
raising her family and now she's she's

390
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
ready to go back to work

391
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,800
what you'll find is that the bigger

392
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,120
companies the amazons the facebooks um

393
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
and and

394
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,880
apples and that they have returned our

395
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,920
programs that have been running

396
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,160
successfully for a number of years and

397
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,279
anyone i've talked to who are running

398
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,040
these returner programs they're hugely

399
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,160
successful and what they will do is say

400
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,560
we'll upskill the individual

401
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,199
they'll work on their um soft skills

402
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,199
their confidence and they'll also give

403
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,519
them some sort of supported phase to

404
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,839
reentry into into

405
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,440
into the workplace

406
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
so what i say to esther is have a look

407
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
at um

408
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,480
ict skills they're running a women

409
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,040
reboot now you'll often find a lot of

410
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,519
these um returner programs are focused

411
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,600
at women but not all of them okay it's

412
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
just that's what what the numbers are

413
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
showing and

414
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,959
by encouraging more women back into the

415
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,680
workplace it helps um deal with the

416
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
diversity issue as well with some of the

417
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
diversity issues we have

418
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,079
um i'd also encourage esther to have a

419
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
look at cyberquest sorry requests are

420
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,639
encouraging encouraging more women back

421
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,639
into the workplace but they're also

422
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,759
looking at others who maybe are ready

423
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,560
for a second career so you'll often see

424
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,920
um individuals from security services

425
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,160
maybe they're retiring at in their early

426
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,560
40s and they've got all those all those

427
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,040
years of experience so why not retrain

428
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,600
and come into cyber security so that

429
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,680
opportu that opportunity is there

430
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
springboard i'd also direct asked her to

431
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,480
springboard and there are lots of

432
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
opportunities there have a look and see

433
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
what area she wants to

434
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
um upskill in

435
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
and again the ict skills net they have

436
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
lots of opportunities and then the last

437
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
thing i'd say to esther is get on to

438
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
cyber women ireland cyber women ireland

439
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,839
is a

440
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,480
voluntary non-profit organization

441
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,519
that is set up to advance uh

442
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,839
to try and get more women into cyber and

443
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
keep women in cyber and also get more

444
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399
women out on media out on the airways

445
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,000
talking about

446
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
cyber security issues i'm on the board

447
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,320
so if anybody is interested um let me

448
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
know we're looking for more and more

449
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,639
people all the time

450
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,720
okay so

451
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
we've gone through that hopefully you've

452
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,279
seen

453
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,000
uh one of those personas resonates with

454
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
you now i do know

455
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
that i've already covered um the courses

456
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,240
that are relevant to ireland that are

457
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,600
supported that are free and low cost and

458
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,680
that have certification they come with

459
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,000
accreditation and i know there's others

460
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,800
out there um such as cisco networking

461
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
academy they're great for and partnering

462
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,679
with some of the other um providers that

463
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,760
we looked at and they have a

464
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,599
fundamentals of cyber security they've

465
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
linux training they've python training

466
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,679
of lots of other bits and pieces

467
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,400
um itac is the innovation technology

468
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,799
atlanta gateway so they're based on the

469
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,839
west they run um cyber security boot

470
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,400
camps and other specific cyber security

471
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
training so if you're over that way have

472
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,200
a look

473
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,799
and they also partner with um skillnet

474
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,120
now there are the moocs like i know

475
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,039
there's loads of subscription services

476
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,799
online there's

477
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,480
pluralsight there's

478
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,600
um cybory and this the likes of hacked

479
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,840
box and try hacking there's all of those

480
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,880
okay and they're really good they offer

481
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,200
either free trials or some sort of free

482
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,039
level of um

483
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,919
access so please check them out as well

484
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
with regards to the moocs the massive

485
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,280
open online courses with coursera and

486
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,480
edx

487
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
you can access and with futurelearn as

488
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
well you can access the education you

489
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,799
can access the training but you will

490
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,960
have to pay for the certificate or

491
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,559
sometimes the exam

492
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,880
and coursera worked with ibm as well

493
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
they they were delivering a course

494
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,200
online and but i think it's it's running

495
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,559
at the moment

496
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,880
futurelearn are backed by

497
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,080
um

498
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,960
open university and i like their courses

499
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,520
especially it's for sort of entry level

500
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,840
and they use sort of mixed media as well

501
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,799
so

502
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,880

505
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,160
that

506
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,000
and i did i know i went a bit fast but i

507
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
was sort of conscious of the time and oh

508
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,679
look i've given you a few extra minutes

509

519
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,919
yes

520
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,360
thank you very much that was brilliant

521
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,160
um i do a lot of like really entry-level

522
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,360
stuff trying to get more people into

523
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
cyber security and i've been asked more

524
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,280
recently going to schools and try to get

525
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
more girls into it but i don't want to

526
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,039
be that guy going out and preaching to

527
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,880
them about yeah cyber so what do you see

528
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,160
are the biggest blockers of the biggest

529
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,919
barriers to girls getting into cyber

530
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
security in the first place

531
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,160
yeah well i'm glad you brought that up

532
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,919
i'm involved in another organization

533
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,480
called cyber for school girls and we do

534
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
exactly what you said we go into schools

535
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,840
and try and get girls um to consider

536
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,600
cyber security as

537
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,520
as a career option and that's what we

538
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,760
can just keep banging the same drum and

539
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
we need to get

540
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,880
we need to get more

541
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,400
i know it's not

542
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,120
women's problem to solve like the

543
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
diversity issue is everybody's problem

544
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,679
and not just women's problems are the

545
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,679
underrepresent underrepresented group so

546
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,440
we all have to do our part

547
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
and so that's one one thing we need to

548
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,080
do um but we do need

549
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,400
role models and

550
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,559
it's a whole you need to see it to be it

551
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,000
and we need to get

552
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,400
the younger women into the schools to

553
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,640
tell them how wonderful it is

554
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,799
um because snoke it's not there's no

555
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,720
good me going in but i go in they see

556
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
their mom or their granny i don't know

557
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,039
but they need to see young

558
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
young women going in and encouraging

559
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,159
them that way and tell them how

560
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,039
how

561
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,440
how great a career it is how much money

562
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,120
they can make how the pandemic um

563
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
made it that we could we didn't lose our

564
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,799
jobs during the pandemic all of these

565
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,960
positive things and

566
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,200
it's fun i see i i love all the all the

567
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,039
tech stuff so it's getting that out

568
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,520
there but i have to say i'm i've been in

569
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,159
the industry a long long time

570
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,120
i'm not seeing huge changes

571
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,440
unfortunately

572
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,360
like when i i did my first degree there

573
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,240
was five women in a room of 100

574
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,120
and

575
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,400
i don't think it's too much different

576
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,440
now from talking to lecturers but

577
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,400
we can just try we can just try okay

578
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,200
and

579
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,400
i haven't

580
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,080
please let me know if there's courses

581
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
there if there's courses you know of

582
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,280
that i haven't mentioned and because

583
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,360
part of the problem is getting this

584
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,280
information together so if you can feed

585
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,640
it into me and i'll try and get it out

586
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,039
there as well

587
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,039
[Music]

588
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,440
well you know what we i've only come on

589
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,679
to the board and it's sort of been it

590
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,960
hasn't been very active over the last

591
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,919
couple years like a lot of a lot of

592
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,320
organizations but we're certainly open

593
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,200
to

594
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,039
to any options i know cyber ireland does

595
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,799
have a platform for jobs um but yeah it

596
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,440
makes sense it sounds like a good idea

597
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
and but certainly consider it useful

598
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,679
yeah connect me

599
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,120
yeah

600
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
anybody else

601
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,280
okay

602
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,919
so what about the masses what what would

603
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,240
be the best universities to have a mice

604
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
in cyber security

605
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,520
a master's

606
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,360
um

607
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,960
because i'm talking about the low cost

608
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,159
no cost

609
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,480
nci does a master's with um ict skills

610
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,280
if you go into ict skills net

611
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,520
and they have a whole page on cyber

612
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,200
security and they do offer a degree and

613
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,960
the last time they offered it it was a

614
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,559
two-year online um degree with nc sorry

615
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,039
masters with nci you needed to have a

616
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,159
level eight

617
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,600
and it was coming in about i think it

618
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
was like 1500

619
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,280
like i haven't seen value like that

620
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
anywhere for our masters

621
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,520
and so that's that's one i did mine in

622
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
in blanche but um

623
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
but nci that one with nci and it's uh

624
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,559
but have a look at the springboards

625
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,840
i don't know exactly what's on

626
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
springboard at the moment but go on to

627
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,760
springboard and keep checking with

628
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,840
springboard because they update

629
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,240
sometimes there's a january

630
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,039
intake but most often it's um september

631
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,159
october

632
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,280
so have a look at that

633
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,760
yeah and i just want to ask em as a

634
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,200
person who has transitioned from a

635
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
different career into cyber as a female

636
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,120
and i

637
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,279
am currently studying springboard course

638
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,360
um and i'm wondering how important is it

639
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,440
to have the certifications along with

640
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
the qualification as a transitioner with

641
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,559
a previous career if you know them

642
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,840
well

643
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,880
watch

644
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,440
what you'll find i know i i didn't start

645
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,039
getting into cyber security until i was

646
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,559
in my 40s

647
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,760
and

648
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
you're always you're often trying to

649
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,400
prove yourself and having the certs sort

650
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,480
of helps with that you still have to be

651
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,760
able to do the job nothing's going to

652
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
replace that but it might get your foot

653
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,440
in the door

654
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,320
um

655
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,120
and i it sort of goes against

656
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
everything when i say that but i'm just

657
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,440
being realistic you know but connect

658
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,600
let's have a chat okay

659
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
okay

660
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,039
anyone else

661
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,559
go and have your break

662
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,440
okay

663
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,230
thank you very much

664
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,359
[Applause]
