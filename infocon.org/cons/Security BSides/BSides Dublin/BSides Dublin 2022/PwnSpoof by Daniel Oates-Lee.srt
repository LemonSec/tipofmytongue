1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,520
hello thank you for uh coming today um

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,080
i'm going to talk about a open source

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,559
tool that we've built at punk security

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
uh called pound spoof we have developed

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
two different um open source projects

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,359
i'm going to talk about the second

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,279
project towards the end of this

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,880
presentation but today we're going to

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
talk about phone spoof

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,039
and what it does

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,439
so first of all who am i well my name's

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,800
daniel oaksley

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,040
i'm one of the co-directors at punk

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,000
security i've been in working in it for

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,239
over 25 years i started off as a

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,719
developer moved into infrastructure

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,840
support

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
then fell into cyber security because i

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,640
just kept hacking and messing about and

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,399
breaking systems

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,559
um currently working as a cyber security

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,280
consultant kind of specializing in

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,840
devsecops devops and a little bit of pen

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,600
testing uh the reason i put terraformer

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,960
an automator down there is because i

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
love automating everything mortal

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
possible thing that i do

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
so anything that i can do

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
and i can repeat it i will most

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,840
certainly do

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,119
it so

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,600
uh where did phone spoof come from how

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,040
did we come up with this idea and what's

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,880
it all about so

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,159
it came from a delivery package uh that

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
we were delivering to

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
a government indus a government

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,720
department and what they ask was is that

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
they wanted to be able to

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
teach their incident responders how to

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,280
be able to pivot through web logs and

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,520
look for threats

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,680
and we kind of you know they wanted to

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
learn how to be able to use regex and

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,479
real-time extraction inside splunk and

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,399
they wanted to be able to

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,360
uh

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
leverage some of the geolocation

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
functionality in it

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,439
and we thought well how do we get these

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,320
logs where do you where did it come from

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
so we we sat down and we had a thought

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,960
that had a think about it we we thought

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,799
well this realistically there's three

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,719
places that you can get log files from

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,079
you can either get them from a real

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,119
attack

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,399
you can

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,639
create something or you can try and

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,400
spoof something

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
so

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
what are the um what are the advantages

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,959
of these well

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,200
a real attack it's authentic

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,520
but it's going to be full of sensitive

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
information it's only going to be one

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
time and by the time you've um there's

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,120
going to be parts of the attack that

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
might be missing it's not really

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,959
scalable so we kind of dismissed that

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,319
idea

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,840
we then moved on to could we reproduce

73
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,040
something could we stand up a test

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,800
environment and could we build something

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,319
out and we thought

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,319
yeah we probably could you know you

77
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,040
could spend ages building a vulnerable

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,239
application

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,720
you could stand up some clients start

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
creating user activities but again it's

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,840
not it's not very easy to do and it

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
takes time and effort and then we

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
thought well

84
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
we could spoof something um

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
and that's kind of where we kind of

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,800
ended up going towards so

87
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
producing a real set of logs would

88
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
involve like as i was just saying a

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
proper web application a lot of

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,000
infrastructure a lot of time and effort

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
but if we start looking at how we can

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
spoof the logs well what are the logs

93
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
themselves they're just a flat file

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,159
system there's an rfc that stipulates

95
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,080
how the log files need to look and how

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
they need to feel

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,560
and it's very easy to just create a

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
bunch of

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
a bunch of text inside a log file

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,080
and it's easy for us to manipulate and

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,200
change

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,080
but

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,760
we decided that rather than just

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
creating a bunch of get requests we

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
would try and make it look as real as

106
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,319
possible

107
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
so what we did is we broke it up into

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,120
three parts you've got this part over

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
here which is kind of the interaction

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
with the website itself then you've got

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
the user interactions themselves and

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
then we created like this pat activity

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,879
pattern

114
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,280
so the interaction over here

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,519
helps create things like the url the

116
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,280
amount of data that was sent the

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,519
reference headers trying to make it look

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
as realistic as possible

119
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,920
then we spent a bit of time on creating

120
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
like usernames we spent some time

121
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
looking at the geo um at the eye the the

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
source ips and we've we've

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
we've done quite well with that we've

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
gone and collected the geo location

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,720
databases and then use that for figuring

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
out where users might be located

127
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
and spent a bit of time about uh well

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
when do users normally use kind of

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
websites and stuff like that

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,240
so to match try and make the

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
the pattern of life here

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
this little bit of kind of artificial

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,479
intelligence-y bit as realistic as

134
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,479
possible

135
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,800
what happens is we'll create the

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,919
sessions

137
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,240
and then we then sort the sessions and

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
then output the information into a log

139
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,479
file

140
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
so

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
what we've done inside the logs is we've

142
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
created three different types of

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
applications to be spoofed

144
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,479
we've got a fake banking app we've got a

145
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,199
generic website and we've also outputted

146
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,360
a wordpress server server

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
we then set

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
configured the python script to be able

149
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,000
to output in iis nginx or apache log

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
formats because obviously there's lots

151
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
of different web services and people

152
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,320
need to be able to collect the logs

153
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
we created a lot of background noise so

154
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
as i was saying rather than just doing

155
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,199
url requests we've got requests for css

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,280
files javascripts

157
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,320
made it trying to make the the the log

158
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,680
files look as as authentic as possible

159
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,520
and then we started looking at making

160
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
sure that we got like the reference

161
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
fields all correct as well so when

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
you're actually looking at these logs

163
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
you could be

164
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,039
mistaken for thinking that they were

165
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,520
accurate

166
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
so what are some of the use cases for

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,919
this um obviously there's there's

168
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,639
training and this is phone spoof is now

169
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,880
being used in a couple of universities

170
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,160
across in america for um

171
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
used by um

172
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,479
by the lecturers for helping the

173
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,520
students uh read some log files

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
uh it's also used uh by jj davies

175
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,919
for some of his training uh when he's

176
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,360
training his sim

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
uh threat hunters

178
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,680
it's also been used in a couple of ctfs

179
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
uh it's been used specifically in war

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
games

181
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,199
it's been used by b-sides up in

182
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,160
newcastle as part of their ctf and

183
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
digital over over uh dose and that

184
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
actually was used last year and we're

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,680
punk security are sponsoring it this

186
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
year and we're running another ctf with

187
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,000
it so what we'll do is we'll generate a

188
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,080
bunch of flags hide that information

189
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,479
inside the log files and then ask you to

190
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,599
go and try and hold them out but

191
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,360
let's see if i can actually do a proper

192
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
live demo and i'll show you what the

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,039
python script looks like how quick it is

194
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,039
to actually generate these log files and

195
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,720
then how you can ingest them and what

196
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
they look like inside splunk

197
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,520
so let's just hope the demo gods are

198
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,919
with me

199
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,960
all right

200
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
is that

201
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
is that large enough for everybody

202
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,599
yeah

203
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,880
everybody at the back you can see that

204
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,360
all right yeah cool brilliant

205
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,639
all right just give me a second i'm just

206
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,840
going to log into

207
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
so as i say phone spoof is a

208
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120
um

209
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,280
it's a python script

210
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
and

211
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,479
i'll zoom out a little bit just so you

212
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,599
can see this

213
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,800
so we've got

214
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
obviously we've got the beautiful ascii

215
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,800
art up at the top because why not throw

216
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,879
that back to retro styles

217
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
and we've got a couple of arguments that

218
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,039
you need to to use so

219
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,720
obviously we've got the

220
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
three different types of application

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,919
that you might be interested in we

222
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,720
created a banking app and it shows a

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
user logging in and being able to

224
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,039
transfer some data around

225
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,960
sorry some money around we've got a

226
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,199
wordpress site and we've got a generic

227
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,400
app

228
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,039
the minus out that was

229
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,639
that's used for where you're going to

230
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
store your log files

231
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,840
you can

232
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,039
enable this minus minus iocs and what

233
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,879
that will do is it will output on the

234
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,520
screen that indicates a compromise

235
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,080
say that you're running a challenge for

236
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
the uh your kids or

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,559
fellow colleagues or whatever you need

238
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,479
to know what whether they've actually

239
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,080
found the uh the threat actor

240
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,399
you can also state the start date and

241
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
end date of the log files how many log

242
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
sessions there are by default we put in

243
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
2 000 users so it will generate 2 000

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
users worth of activities over a period

245
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
of i think it's about three weeks

246
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,760
by default

247
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
uh you can also set the number of user

248
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,240
sessions you can customize your server

249
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,800
fqdns if you want to i am also going to

250
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,519
just quickly explain you can also add

251
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,360
into this a uh um

252
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,080
where is it now

253
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,920
i think it's that one there yeah i think

254
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
it's that far there you can go into burp

255
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
suite and you can do a site map

256
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
of your own website if you wanted to so

257
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,880
you could make it look you know dump the

258
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,040
the the structure of your own website

259
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,760
out to help generate uh authentic logs

260
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
for your users

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,519
and then obviously you've got the server

262
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,519
log types here so you've got iis you've

263
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,080
got nginx or you've got lf

264
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,880
uh cls which is uh generally apache

265
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,279
you can also put some attack settings

266
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,560
down here by default it'll randomize it

267
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
and so it'll only by default unless you

268
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
stay how many times you want somebody to

269
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
be attacking you it will hide one attack

270
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,480
inside this log file the default is also

271
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,399
a brute force but you can either do

272
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,320
brute force or a command injection

273
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,279
attack so showing that the user's uh

274
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,279
entering a command injection and you can

275
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,920
also state the geolocation of your

276
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,040
attacking group so obviously if

277
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
you want to blame russia for something

278
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,680
then you can just type in ru and away

279
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
you go

280
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
you can also edit the user agent that

281
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,720
the attacker might be wanting to use

282
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,519
so

283
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,240
i'm just going to clear my screen again

284
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,360
and then what we're going to do is we're

285
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,399
just going to

286
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,360
um

287
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
we're just going to quickly generate a

288
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,920
log actually i won't i'm going to type

289
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,079
this out down at the bottom

290
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,000
all right so what we're going to do is

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,279
in this case we're going to create a

292
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,040
a wordpress

293
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
output

294
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
sorry

295
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
we're going to create a wordpress one

296
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
we're going to output the file into this

297
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
area so we'll call it webapp.la

298
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,800
and

299
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,480
i'm not going to output the indicator

300
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
but actually uh well i'll show you that

301
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,519
indicate what what you get with the

302
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,279
indicators of compromise

303
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,200
we're also going to put in

304
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,839
the server

305
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,399
fqdn

306
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
as

307
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,959
as uh punk security dot co dot uk

308
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,760
and we're going to set the server

309
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
log type

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
to

311
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,720
set it to engine x

312
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,079
um

313
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,720
does anybody want to

314
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,160
stipulate where the attacker's

315
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,279
geolocation might come from

316
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
island right okay

317
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,920
i believe it's ie for ireland

318
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,120
so

319
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
what it'll do now

320
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
uh it's now generating those two

321
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,279
thousands two thousand users worth of

322
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,519
activities it's randomly generating and

323
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,760
they might be slightly out of order uh

324
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,079
so it generates all the sessions first

325
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,399
and then it will order the order those

326
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,519
um order those sessions and it'll output

327
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,839
it into the log file and that is it it's

328
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,920
as quick and as easy as that something

329
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
that would normally have taken you

330
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,399
several months to build the

331
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,639
infrastructure build the application is

332
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,519
now just taking about 10 seconds to run

333
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,079
and generate a log file now this log

334
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,320
file will be unique every time you run

335
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,399
it and the reason that we wanted that

336
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,680
uniqueness

337
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
is when we're delivering our training

338
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
for threat hunting

339
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,760
it's you know the students don't just go

340
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
oh yes it's this ip address and then

341
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,800
share it amongst themselves they've

342
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,160
actually got to go and do the work

343
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
themselves

344
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
so now we've done that

345
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,880
we'll just quickly open up um

346
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,839
my favorite

347
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,279
so there are other obviously there are

348
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
other sims that you can input stuff into

349
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,959
i'm just happy to use splunk because

350
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,399
it's nice and easy for me to spin up

351
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,360
oh

352
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
helps if i can

353
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
type password give me a second

354
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,440
and

355
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,240
is it inspect yeah oh it's just password

356
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,440
i just set

357
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,399
a quick docker image this morning

358
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,120
just for the uh just for this so we go

359
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
and ingest the log file

360
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,000
just upload the log file

361
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,720
and there it is there you go you can see

362
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,519
it's 20 28 meg

363
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,120
near it off

364
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,519
uh click next

365
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,839
we then state what kind of log file it

366
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,839
is it's already picked it out so that's

367
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,519
perfect for us

368
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,760
uh we'll create a new

369
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,439
uh demo one

370
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,800
yep so we're gonna use demo one preview

371
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,760
next

372
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,399
and then it'll be uploaded

373
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,959
and now we can start going in and we can

374
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,839
start carving this data up so we can

375
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,760
start running things like

376
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,880
um if we have a quick look

377
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,160
over a period of time

378
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
zoom out

379
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,639
didn't mean to do that no

380
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,959
sorry

381
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
there you go you can see that it's um it

382
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,399
started on the fifth

383
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
on the on the 5th of march and it's gone

384
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,959
all the way up to like the 20th and if

385
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,560
you have a look down through these you

386
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,360
can see that um

387
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
splunk's done a marvelous job at

388
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,800
identifying all these different areas

389
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,399
and you can see some of your client ip

390
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
addresses and what have you

391
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
and then you can start carving up your

392
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
data

393
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,839
so you can do it by account by

394
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,760
the http status code

395
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
oops

396
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,880
there you go and you can start seeing

397
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,639
that there's like quite a lot of success

398
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,480
falls there's some redirects and there's

399
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,560
some 401s we might be interested in

400
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,480
going investigating those four ones and

401
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
going further and deeper

402
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,320
and one of the things that we were

403
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,720
wanting to get people to understand is

404
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,639
how to start searching around this and

405
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,240
i'm not going to deliver a course about

406
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,959
how to use splunk and reg exit it's

407
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,560
something that we're looking to do later

408
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,600
on

409
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
um yeah so there you go you can see that

410
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,959
you can generate these log files really

411
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,800
quickly chuck them into splunk and you

412
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
start carving up the data and and

413
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,079
playing around with stuff

414
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,040
should we go back to the demo

415
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
yeah so we've covered off the

416
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,519
actual

417
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,160
um bits themselves what else we've what

418
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
we've also done is we've also added in a

419
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
bit of smoke testing into the script

420
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,759
itself so if we find that the where

421
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,199
we're looking for a certain number of

422
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,959
sessions uh the say we it's estimated to

423
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,079
be 100 sessions and we wanted 10 users

424
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
then it's going through and it's doing

425
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,440
some mathematical calculations to make

426
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,839
sure that it's not randomly just not

427
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,399
generating the correct amount of data

428
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,720
um

429
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,759
let's just have a quick look so yeah

430
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,360
i've recorded this just in case stuff

431
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
was going going to go wrong so this is a

432
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,120
um a screenshot of of splunk again with

433
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,680
um showing you how those that pattern of

434
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,040
life that we created kind of follows a

435
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,800
standard pattern you know you've got

436
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,320
users logging in the morning for the

437
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
banking app and then they might do a

438
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,519
little bit of spike of activity in the

439
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,600
evenings but then die off overnight

440
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,320
and

441
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
one of the latest features that we've

442
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,839
done is well

443
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,519
this is a few months ago but um we've

444
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,360
added inside splunk the ability for you

445
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,959
to be able to go and collect that site

446
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,920
map as i was just explaining

447
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,679
on the roadmap

448
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,640
for stuff that we'd like to do um

449
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,000
we're busy working on at the moment

450
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,079
we're trying to create a pip install so

451
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,599
you can just go into python and you can

452
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,119
just download and install this without

453
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,119
having to do any you know go to our

454
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,240
github and go and download stuff

455
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,919
we're also looking to add more

456
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,880
applications into the um

457
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,640
into like that area where it's got

458
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,120
banking wordpress and generic website

459
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
we're looking to put more stuff inside

460
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,600
there we're looking to add some more

461
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,919
attack types so rather than just the

462
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,600
brute force and command injection we're

463
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
looking to put some extra stuff in there

464
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
but we're trying to be very cl which

465
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
we're trying to be as realistic as

466
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,160
possible about it because there's only

467
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
so much that you can get in these some

468
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,960
of these logs

469
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,520
and we also want to do slightly better

470
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,080
geographic geo lookups

471
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
and start developing some training

472
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,919
packages for people so

473
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,600
just do a couple of little

474
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
powerpoint slides maybe a couple of

475
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,520
videos explaining how to

476
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,240
get the log files into a sim how you can

477
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
start doing some regex lookups and stuff

478
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,000
like that

479
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,120
and what you know anything else that you

480
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,960
guys can think of that phone spoof might

481
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
be able to do we've been approached by

482
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
gray logs as well

483
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
and asked whether we can

484
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,039
potentially get phone spoof to create

485
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,880
windows event logs we've been

486
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
investigating that and we think it is

487
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,160
possible

488
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,200
we're just

489
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,559
trying to figure out the best ways of

490
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,880
being able to do that

491
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,840
and

492
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,200
now

493
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
i know i'm

494
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
i'm at the end now but

495
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,880
um i'm also going to quickly talk about

496
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
another project that we've also got

497
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,880
um on on the roadmap but i'll i'll take

498
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,120
some questions first if if anybody's got

499
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,039
any questions or anything you'd like me

500
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,840
to go back over again

501
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,320
now all right that's cool um

502
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
so and another project that we've

503
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
currently been working on

504
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
and i'll just minimize that is a

505
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
ransomware readiness audit tool called

506
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,640
sm beagle

507
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,360
and

508
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,679
what this does is it runs as a low

509
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,880
privileged user on your on on a on an

510
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,000
endpoint

511
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
and you can then

512
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,360
collect

513
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,679
information about your network shares

514
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
and it will it will iterate through your

515
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,000
network as a low privileged user dump

516
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,919
out your file shares and your structures

517
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,600
put them into an elastic

518
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
stack so then you can better understand

519
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,280
how and what sorry where all of your

520
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,840
your network shares are

521
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
and

522
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,600
it's also been used by red teams as well

523
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
to be able to go and hunt down and find

524
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
rogue file shares with passwords in and

525
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,799
we've just ported that on to linux

526
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,000
as well

527
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,320
but i think that's that's it for me
