1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,920
good so let's uh let's get started and

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,120
talk about

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,599
um this is one of my favorite types of

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,320
topics um or types of sessions actually

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
kind of a ranty war story uh session

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
on enterprise cloud security and

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,600
very very specifically uh on

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,359
what can be cut what can we do better

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
what can we learn learn from from those

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
different approaches

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,160
very briefly from if if this thing works

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,560
let's see

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,360
i guess it doesn't

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,440
magic okay

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
very briefly from my side

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,680
i'm a consultant i consult

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,440
enterprises mostly but also also

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,360
smaller startups who aspire to be

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
enterprises at some point

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,280
so they have also

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,399
enterprise-like requirements for

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,160
for some of their

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,399
cloud environments i've been mostly

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,520
working with azure myself for more than

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,640
a decade now but i'll try to translate

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,840
on the fly

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
into us as cloud diagnostic stuff as as

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
possible

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,799
on

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,479
on any of those points when i'm actually

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,479
going going going technical

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,400
so

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
again not working what am i doing

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,640
nope there you go so the plan for the

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,920
session is

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
to really get a quick primer not on

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,240
cloud security kind of technical topics

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
i'm not going to talk about what is iam

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
and what is

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,759
what are some of the very basic tenets

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,759
there but really kind of get into the

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,600
mind of what's happening on from an

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
enterprise per enterprises perspective

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,479
with regards to cloud security and how

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,479
is that maybe different or how is that

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,280
handled um handled in a typical

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,000
organization that i've i've

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
worked with

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
and uh we'll talk about this kind of

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,240
basic problem area of the enterprise

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,920
cloud security space uh then we'll take

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
a look at some of those cloud security

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
programs how does that work from a

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,800
perspective of

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,878
do we hire someone from the outside do

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,200
we just get kind of

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
some insurance what are the options that

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
are we going to do about it and then we

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,800
are going to look at a little bit more

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
details into the architectural

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,480
components of a typical cloud security

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,959
architecture how does that fit into into

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,640
an existing enterprise security

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
architecture and

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,840
all all along i'll try to add some kind

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,239
of reality checks and lessons learned

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,760
throughout these different session parts

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
as well but really towards uh then we

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,280
also

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
also wrapped this up on the last

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
10 15 minutes of the show

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,120
all right so

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,360
let's get started with uh with the first

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
first part in here

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,400
and

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,720
this isn't really a surprise to anyone

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,519
who's who's here we we all saw this kind

78
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,560
of

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
barrage of memes means about who was the

80
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,280
biggest digital transfer transformator

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,959
transformer etc for our um

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,560
see through it and it's not of course

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
the ceo it's not the cio it's the kobe

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,720
19. and basically what happened is that

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,680
everyone who was hesitating uh of not

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
going going to the cloud at all needed

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,400
to take the jump uh in

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,760
in weeks maybe maybe even days and

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
that meant that most of most of us or

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
most of the enterprises went there fast

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,519
and then now all of us from the security

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
practitional perspective we needed to

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
figure out how now that we are here how

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
do we actually make this being here

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,760
anyway secure whereas previously it was

96
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,159
kind of analyzes paralysis that we were

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,319
kind of just continuing to argue and

98
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,000
argue about whether or not to go to the

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,080
cloud when will we go to the cloud et

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
cetera et cetera

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
lots of different industries of course

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,319
still are there still not everyone made

103
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,720
made the jump with all of the workloads

104
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,000
but

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
if your ceo is already taking their

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
email

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
checking their emails chats video

108
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,159
discussions etc already on the cloud

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,599
you've already started to think about

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,238
what is this split tunnel tunneling and

111
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,839
all of this uh previously scary stuff

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,400
uh you you kind of had to do it already

113
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,440
then

114
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
it's it's somewhat easier to kind of

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
retroactively start thinking about how

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,840
to how to start securing

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,280
all of this

118
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,639
and really these public cloud vendors uh

119
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
kind of prove themselves in terms of the

120
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,040
capacity as well in terms of

121
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,199
available kind of peak capacity there

122
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,320
were some hiccups on on all of those

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,040
and especially also on the

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
on the availability of these services

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,160
uh very early on in a couple of a couple

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,240
of first weeks of of the pandemic for

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
example

128
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
for example look at microsoft they

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
really squeeze down the limitations of

130
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,039
okay you cannot really provision

131
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
anything else if you were a total new

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
customer if you already were on board

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
you had your enterprise kind of

134
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,160
agreements everything you had to

135
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,600
building relationship supports

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
everything on there you've got priority

137
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
um so they they had the processes in

138
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
place and they they managed to have also

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
the physical capacity and the logistics

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,840
uh in place to handle handle those new

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
workloads as well so basically the the

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
whole kind of cloud model is now kind of

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
went from this kind of

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,039
early innovator

145
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,199
chasm and kind of made the jump on on

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,440
that early adoption curve so to say

147
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,520
so

148
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,199
we basically need to start thinking

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,479
about

150
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,720
shift shifting away from

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
thinking about cloud security as

152
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
something that is

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
an isolated domain of information

154
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,199
security some a specialization of of

155
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
someone like we would have like

156
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
application security or network security

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,919
it's

158
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,400
someone's speciality it's basically now

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,759
something that everyone needs to

160
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,080
understand up to uh

161
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
up to a ac

162
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
up to a level right

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
but also at the same time the kind of

164
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
traditional rules of of an enterprise's

165
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,280
point of view of having a trusted mood

166
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,479
or a perimeter perimeter around our safe

167
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,240
safeguards of data that doesn't really

168
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
fly anymore either

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,919
and

170
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
we really need to start now talking

171
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,000
about how do we actually secure those

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
those assets that have some sort of an

173
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
exposure to the cloud side of things

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,520
and hopefully maybe the mindset has

175
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,479
shifted that kind of cloud is not uh not

176
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,960
something that can be at most as secure

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,240
as something that we can do on the uh

178
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
on our own especially on kind of

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
mid uh or medium-sized organizations and

180
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,759
and up from there but also something

181
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,639
that potentially can can be better than

182
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,759
what we have

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
um in our own environments if we do it

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,840
right of course if we screw things up

185
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,400
then the exposure area is of course

186
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,599
much bigger so we need something called

187
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,240
cloud native security this is uh one one

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
look at this thing uh cloud native of

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,840
course is also part of you know it's not

190
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
just containers in my context what i

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,639
mean with cloud native is that it's

192
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,800
it's not

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,639
it's specific to each of each of the

194
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,240
clouds that you are you are working with

195
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,319
so if you are working with aws usually

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,240
use the native tools and capabilities

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319
there if you're using azure the same

198
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,400
thing going on there if you are looking

199
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,639
at building a cloud-native security

200
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,880
organization you need to start thinking

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
about what are the cloud-native skills

202
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,280
that i have that i need there do i

203
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,479
actually need to ship all of my previous

204
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,560
security architects into a cloud course

205
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
most likely yes but do they need to be

206
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,919
purely cloud specialists by kind of

207
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,520
completely forgetting forgetting what

208
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,160
they did earlier no it's it's something

209
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,599
something in the middle

210
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,160
so it's kind of completely different uh

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,639
set of approaches we have less control

212
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,160
available by default we need to

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,400
understand a ton of new product names

214
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,160
within the individual clouds that we are

215
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
working on

216
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,280
uh even if we are dealing with only

217
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
infrastructure service or platform as a

218
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,840
service of course then when we add

219
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,520
software as a service on top of that

220
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,039
then you know it's

221
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
in infinity then it's about identities

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,759
maybe maybe barely some

223
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,919
um

224
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,319
there's identities maybe maybe some some

225
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,160
level of access access control that we

226
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,319
can add there to kind of at least bring

227
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,039
our own identity provider and then it's

228
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,840
about

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,559
almost almost going in the full legal

230
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,719
and vendor management mode of trying to

231
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,880
understand each of the software service

232
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,958
providers and how do they run things i'm

233
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,320
trying to make this a little bit easier

234
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
when we are trying to move all our

235
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,880
applications or infra to the cloud then

236
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
we are dealing with provide csps like

237
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
microsoft like amazon like google sim

238
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
ali similars so you need new skills you

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,360
need the skills specific to each of the

240
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
clouds that you are using most likely

241
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,480
you are using more than one but my kind

242
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,440
of opinionated part of of this round is

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
really really that

244
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
you can do multiple clouds

245
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
you can do multi-cloud but that just

246
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
means that you need to have multiple

247
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
single cloud

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
expertise and multiple single cloud

249
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,760
programs and and people behind it

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,320
so this is kind of brand of building it

251
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,080
in not bolting it on

252
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,399
so if you if you've seen any any cloud

253
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
security stuff you're seeing kind of the

254
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,200
approach of cloud security is a shared

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,839
responsibility when you move from uh

256
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,040
from uh

257
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,720
left right when you when you move from

258
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,200
on-premises you have the most control

259
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,279
available you are also responsible of

260
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,959
everything if you move all the way on

261
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,640
the spectrum to the software service

262
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
side you have the least controls

263
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,880
available for you mainly on the data

264
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,200
data and endpoint side maybe on the

265
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
identity but everything else is done for

266
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,839
you and you can basically just do your

267
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,680
due diligence or maybe get a better

268
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,360
pricing tier and that's about it

269
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
so most likely this is familiar to you

270
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,279
if you dabble with cloud security

271
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,320
overall

272
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
and a lot of the organizations do

273
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,800
understand this even if they they didn't

274
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
yet

275
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,839
go to the cloud fully

276
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
what i argue is that you really need to

277
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,720
the kind of

278
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
the point of of the earlier slide saying

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
that you also need to do this natively

280
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,959
for each of the cloud and each of the

281
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,640
cloud service that you are using within

282
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
the cloud is that

283
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
you really need to understand what does

284
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
the shared responsibility model mean not

285
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
just hey we are using azure or we are

286
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,839
using aws but for each of the service

287
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
what are the parts that are actually

288
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,839
handled by us

289
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,120
and what are the parts that we are

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
responsible for and what are the parts

291
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
that we can even control here's an

292
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
example of of managed kubernetes

293
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
services there's different acronym for

294
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
this from each of the cloud providers

295
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
that and

296
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,880
each of these have of course different

297
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,399
ways of hosting the containers uh but

298
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,079
this is an example of something that

299
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,600
sounds very much

300
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
tempting in terms of hey we get to be in

301
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
control of of the workloads we get to

302
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
get some unlimited scalability and we

303
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,040
also get

304
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,640
someone else to manage the infra off

305
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
of our kubernetes workloads well in

306
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,760
reality

307
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,399
we mostly uh only get

308
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
a little bit fancier infrastructure as a

309
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,600
service and just a teeny tiny bit of

310
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
container as a service doubled on top of

311
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
it everything else is still are

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,959
responsible most most of these cases aks

313
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,480
eks and g key we basically just just get

314
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,160
a managed version of the keyboard in

315
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,120
this control plane which is the one that

316
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
then goes ahead and does the actual

317
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
orchestration spins up new nodes and

318
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
then spins up new

319
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,360
containers into those nodes the nodes

320
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,839
themselves are our responsibility we

321
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,680
need to either kill them off very fast

322
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,560
and update them regularly or we

323
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,800
depending on our maturity and depending

324
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,880
on our approach there we might need to

325
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
actually think about hardening this at

326
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
least monitor what's going on in those

327
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,760
environments

328
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,720
we saw earlier last year for example

329
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,600
with the with the ombi guard on on azure

330
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
site where basically

331
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,160
not all customers who were using these

332
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
services understood that even though

333
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,399
that microsoft provisions

334
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,959
the csp provisions a node that hosts

335
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,399
your containers

336
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,480
and they patch and they provide you a

337
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,160
patch for them uh

338
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
kind of it's available you still

339
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,440
actually need to

340
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
go ahead and kill those nodes and and

341
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,160
get those new nodes up and running and

342
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
that's all your responsibility the

343
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,880
bigger part of

344
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
of this beautiful

345
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,399
colorful display here

346
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
so

347
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,079
kind of a little bit of an intro um uh

348
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,440
intro on the on the approach on the

349
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,839
cloud security site then quite typically

350
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,279
when we actually start thinking about

351
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,160
okay now we have some budget yay

352
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,040
pandemic gave us budget pandemic gave us

353
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
a way of now that no we are in the cloud

354
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
we need to now actually secure this uh

355
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,240
then what's going to happen

356
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
basically as with any any enterprise

357
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
there's already existing existing set of

358
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,200
people there's existing vendors maybe

359
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,240
the

360
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,800
caesar and the cto have different budget

361
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,320
than the folks who are driving in the

362
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
cloud

363
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,639
of course you need to put all of those

364
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,200
in the same uh same kind of internal

365
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,120
political um warfare but

366
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,320
if you're looking at this from the

367
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
perspective that we will already have an

368
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
idea of what are we going to do on the

369
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,480
cloud we know that there's only one part

370
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
of the organization who's handling it we

371
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,560
don't have any turf force or anything

372
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,399
then then it's basic basically about

373
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,519
balancing this the scales of

374
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,160
of these business needs of

375
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,279
of we need to be there fast

376
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,839
and we need to do whatever we do ai

377
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,320
blockchain whatever that the latest

378
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
types do we have in here

379
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,959
in addition to the basically the ease of

380
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
this shadow cloud basically if you

381
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,839
if we make this too hard

382
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,480
then our customers the business will

383
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,079
just swipe their credit card and do

384
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,000
their own thing in their own isolated

385
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,240
environment and we are known the visor

386
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
on the other hand we of course have have

387
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,440
our kind of existing security

388
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,360
requirements that might need update

389
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,399
upgrading to the to this decade or or to

390
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,440
to even acknowledge the concept of us

391
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,839
not understanding or us not being

392
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,639
uh physically uh in the ownership of the

393
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,720
whole stack end-to-end

394
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,800
um and at the same time we have we have

395
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,240
more and more people coming in and

396
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,680
taking um

397
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,440
potentially

398
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,079
more risks uh in our environments

399
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,120
when when a developer was working on or

400
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
any

401
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,240
uh any user was working on our own

402
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,079
environment we were basically able to

403
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,240
control limit the amount of damage when

404
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,959
they

405
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,279
when their environment goes boom

406
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,519
then it was still within within our

407
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,760
trusted trusted network perimeter and

408
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,680
within our uh monitored environment

409
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
now if if something goes wrong they can

410
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,920
potentially expose

411
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,800
themselves to to everyone on the well

412
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,199
one third of the internet everyone is

413
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
able to go ahead and download the ip

414
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,160
address ranges for all of the major csps

415
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
and of course they are getting scanned

416
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
and bombarded all the time if you if you

417
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,639
host your own uh whatever application in

418
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,880
there you can definitely do things the

419
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,079
wrong way

420
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,040
um

421
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,639
and then all of this needs to needs to

422
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,560
of course

423
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,800
fit somehow our existing

424
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,040
security architecture as well

425
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
typically i see this kind of asymmetry

426
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,759
of

427
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,279
there's maybe

428
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,279
one too many relationship of security

429
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,880
architects versus

430
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,800
versus cloud solution architects or or

431
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,360
cloud and even more cloud developers who

432
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
might not even understand the cloud

433
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,240
architecture part let alone the kind of

434
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,759
security implications of of those

435
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,440
a lot of people seem to understand very

436
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,399
well that

437
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
those pricing models of different cloud

438
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
services and architect stuff around

439
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,800
those but not necessarily the the

440
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,360
security parts so basically we need to

441
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
start thinking about

442
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,120
keeping our

443
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,920
new

444
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
security policies

445
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
competitive and secure

446
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
or updating them in a way that keep us

447
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
competitive

448
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,360
and secure with this with this cloud

449
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,639
move

450
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,199
so basically again if our controls are

451
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,440
too strict if we are too slow at

452
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,199
providing those controls

453
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,120
the developers will start using those

454
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,000
new cloud services themselves either in

455
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,399
our own environment or if we really kind

456
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,880
of go go ahead and have this kind of a

457
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
list of allowed us cloud services in

458
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
there and we enforce that using some

459
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,079
policies or other tools again they have

460
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,120
their option of just picking up a new

461
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,119
cloud environment and doing all of that

462
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,839
on their own just for the development

463
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,679
area and

464
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,319
there's the typical argument is that if

465
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
if we have this kind of

466
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,760
pre-security verification of all

467
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,640
all security all cloud services than it

468
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,079
always takes

469
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
because again the symmetry of

470
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,240
less people on the secure understanding

471
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,079
security than there are people who want

472
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,440
to use the cloud

473
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
because of that asymmetry it will always

474
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
take more time for the central it or the

475
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,919
security organization to catch up and

476
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,679
provide those services so we need to be

477
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,679
fast and we need to

478
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,840
put on those controls that are minimally

479
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,280
disruptive uh to the actual business to

480
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,160
actual

481
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,080
use of those services

482
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
while still trying to balance all of our

483
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,000
existing requirements on the security so

484
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,080
it's a lot about verification so it's a

485
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,120
lot about

486
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,039
shift left and other other approaches

487
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,480
there

488
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
but this is the problem uh problem

489
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,640
statement

490
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,679
and

491
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,679
that's where we can get into a cloud

492
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
security program uh which there's a one

493
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,559
example of that of course you know

494
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,080
as a consultant i'll say everything

495
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,520
depends but basic basically uh you need

496
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,039
to have some sort of a cloud

497
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,280
architecture this this is usually done

498
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
within like a cloud center of excellence

499
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,600
this is maybe done according to the best

500
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,360
practices of the vendor according to

501
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,559
your cloud uh

502
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,880
well arc will architect that frameworks

503
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
on aws side or

504
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,240
cough on on micro micro side of things

505
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
but basically we need to have some sort

506
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,160
of a cloud architecture there might be

507
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
another other team already working on

508
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,640
that we need to update our cloud

509
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,160
security policies

510
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
and we need to be able to start

511
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,520
designing our cloud controls at least

512
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,919
for some parts of our environment maybe

513
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,600
not everything that we already happen to

514
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
have now with the pandemic there but at

515
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
least identifying our own crown jewels

516
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,799
and

517
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
going from from there

518
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,200
it's a as a consultant yes

519
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
it always depends there's always all

520
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,880
nice different boxes maybe the

521
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,799
anti-pattern that i see is that

522
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,280
all of this part is done well the upper

523
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
part all of the cross referencing and

524
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
mapping to external requirements

525
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,160
if this is driven by an internal audit

526
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,919
or risk or compliance part of the

527
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,200
organization

528
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,120
you'll have plenty of beautiful cross

529
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
references and plenty of beautiful excel

530
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,640
sheets

531
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
but you don't actually get any any

532
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,559
controls defined

533
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,080
you need to actually provide the

534
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
real-time data from your cspm or you

535
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,360
need to be able to define uh

536
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,520
kind of bridge the gap between your

537
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,720
fancy governance models and and

538
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,280
your your framework with the actual

539
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,200
security controls that you have in place

540
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
and you need to get some visibility into

541
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,600
uh into this cloud security framework so

542
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
it's not a cloud security framework

543
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,520
which is part of the whole program is

544
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
it's not an excel exercise it's not an

545
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,120
internal audit exercise that's a nice

546
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
outcome of it

547
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
but it needs to be tangible it needs to

548
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
be a set of cloud

549
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,840
native

550
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
policies for example it needs to be a

551
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,840
set of things that you deploy that

552
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
actually control or limit uh what you

553
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
can do in

554
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,399
in your cloud environment

555
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
in a safe and uh

556
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,960
agile and secure way

557
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,400
okay so

558
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,559
to implement all of this you need you

559
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,039
need this cloud security architecture

560
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
typically these

561
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
different components that you will see

562
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,679
see here include the landing zone or

563
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,159
some sort of a secured cloud platform

564
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,400
this typically what this really is is

565
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
basically

566
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,280
well the only technical thing that we

567
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
really have to have there is basically

568
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
the billing relationship so that we

569
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,679
won't our accounts will be taken over if

570
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,240
someone's credit card gets gets stolen

571
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,760
or uh or not updated accordingly and

572
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,080
everything else is basically up to up to

573
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
what you are doing there

574
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,280
it can be a set of set of

575
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,840
tenants it for example on the

576
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,480
aws organization side or azure side you

577
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,200
can you can define to trust a specific

578
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,039
identity provider that you can then link

579
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,840
with your with your existing idp you can

580
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,159
bring in azure active directory to both

581
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,039
of those to control access there it can

582
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,120
be about all of that identity part it

583
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,320
can be about

584
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,799
having some specific um

585
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,960
cloud architecture in place to enable

586
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,799
networking connecting actually back to

587
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,280
your organization the whole concept of

588
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,880
the landing zone depends a little bit

589
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
what you are doing there and there are

590
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,440
best practices and pre-populated stuff

591
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,280
available for you there but basically

592
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,000
it's

593
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,919
either some infrastructure as code that

594
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
you you keep on updating and deploying

595
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,440
or it it's at least someone did once

596
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,679
this one vpn connection to our cloud and

597
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
then we have this one account or a

598
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,440
subscription where we are deploying

599
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,320
stuff and

600
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
everything more granular from there and

601
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,799
within that there's different approaches

602
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,640
different concepts uh you can use

603
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,600
different cloud products these different

604
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
cloud services like lambdas or aci or

605
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,200
aks and basically your cloud application

606
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,120
or a cloud workload the workload is just

607
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,000
a collection of those if you are

608
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
a larger enterprise or if you just

609
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,159
buy like a buy like a large enterprise

610
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,000
you might want to have a

611
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
customized versions of these products so

612
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,679
you might want to have your own

613
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,919
repository of your

614
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,000
of the same products but with your

615
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
default configuration maybe you have

616
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,799
your built-in hardening there you have

617
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,080
the specific

618
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,480
controls already inside those products

619
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
so you are not even letting your

620
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,720
developers freely freely deploy stuff

621
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
from the portals or consoles you just

622
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,960
give them a bunch of infrastructures

623
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,679
code and say okay this is our

624
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,880
uh

625
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,440
enterprise version of lambda this is our

626
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,080
enterprise version of

627
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,039
rds or azure sql database use this when

628
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,880
you deploy then you're golden you don't

629
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
need to worry about it

630
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,480
that again requires that we do all of

631
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,559
this pre-work and keep on being faster

632
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,000
than all of the requirements from our

633
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
developers

634
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
whichever approach you take basically

635
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,720
you will have some sort of awake

636
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,799
landings or some sort of a secured cloud

637
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,840
environment

638
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,760
uh that

639
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,919
a bunch of people are going to deploy

640
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,640
much more rapidly uh different cloud

641
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,960
products uh into that

642
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
and they might even interconnect

643
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,120
even if you don't need so you need to

644
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
have some sort of controls to put in

645
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,799
place in there uh identity and access

646
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,799
management is something that we always

647
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,799
always think in this landing zone i

648
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,960
mentioned that it can be just a simple

649
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,039
thing as a tenant where you have very

650
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,039
very connected possibility to your

651
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,880
existing identity system uh here we need

652
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
to think about how does all of this fit

653
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
into our existing enterprise im

654
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,880
processes the abort service now a year

655
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,200
ago it was uh

656
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
it's still ongoing the implementation uh

657
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,720
project

658
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,159
now we are going to have a bunch of

659
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,240
bunch

660
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,320
plenty of new roles in in this cloud

661
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,400
world we don't even know how many roles

662
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,279
uh before we before we get started so

663
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,279
how does that pacing work together with

664
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,240
uh with these cloud requirements again

665
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,799
do we need to think about separating uh

666
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,679
admin credentials for cloud is our cloud

667
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,480
tenant different from our

668
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,440
is our business productivity tenant

669
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
different from our uh apps and infra

670
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
tenant do we have a separate attractive

671
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
directory or whatever we are using for

672
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,679
them um

673
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,440
will we have different set of access

674
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,720
controls for

675
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,480
or you will have different sets of

676
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,320
access controls for the

677
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
control plane or

678
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
management pane

679
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
of your cloud environment so meaning who

680
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,400
can go ahead and deploy those aks

681
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,720
create and delete those clusters versus

682
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,200
who can go in inside those vms who can

683
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,760
actually get those ssh keys or however

684
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,600
you're authenticating there and actually

685
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,640
make those patches inside uh inside

686
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,279
those those nodes and the same is true

687
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,039
with uh with all of those different

688
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,960
services that you're using

689
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,279
and you don't have this this con

690
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,120
you don't have this decomposition of

691
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,320
control

692
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,559
and management plain versus data plane

693
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,799
before you actually do this

694
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,039
uh this bit of analysis of the shared

695
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,600
responsibility model that that we did

696
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,880
earlier there

697
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
so all of this

698
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,039
surprisingly connects and then you need

699
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,360
to think about external users do you

700
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
have exactly the same set of external

701
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,760
user or guest user onboarding do you

702
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,919
still ship your company laptop to your

703
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,600
external developers who are working on

704
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,279
your cloud environments

705
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,840
uh if you do then what what's happening

706
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,039
with your network controls again do you

707
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,760
do you have a set of conditions that

708
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,000
allow your developers to only access

709
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
access the cloud environment cloud

710
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,000
console or portal only from the company

711
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,919
network within with all of those

712
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,640
specific criteria being met

713
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,840
maybe yes

714
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,440
maybe that's going to take some time and

715
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,600
you gradually will shift towards that

716
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,279
and then finally how do you think about

717
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,440
all of this when everything should be on

718
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,480
that

719
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,400
should be deployed not by developers

720
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
going into the portal but actually going

721
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
to some infrastructure as code

722
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
updates in your section of pipeline and

723
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,039
then you're basically once you're done

724
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,960
kind of hardening all of your accounts

725
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,440
and subscriptions you start to

726
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,200
understand that they're actually

727
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,440
more or less persistent access that you

728
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,559
need to create

729
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,840
to your deployment pipelines into those

730
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,159
same environments that will have to have

731
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,720
by definition a lot of power they will

732
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
need to have

733
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,120
basically right access to create read

734
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
update and delete all of those resources

735
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,520
in order to create read update and

736
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,120
delete your cloud environment that's

737
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,039
that's your data center now it's it's

738
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,880
it's completely

739
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,039
defined as infrastructure as code

740
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,360
and you know stay here in the room to

741
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,679
check the next session i guess to how to

742
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,559
do that um but from an infrastructure or

743
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,480
from the iem perspective

744
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,880
you basically you don't have a single

745
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,360
place uh where you can see okay who has

746
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,240
root on my cloud cloud subscriptions

747
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,799
because you will have that

748
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,000
shared

749
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,559
service principle or something else that

750
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,520
is being used as the credentials of your

751
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
whole sections pipeline that might might

752
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,039
be

753
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,640
a single

754
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
a single user or a single service

755
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,120
principal or all of your teams might be

756
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,080
sharing that it might be

757
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,320
basically you need to combine

758
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
your

759
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
ci cd access logs and access reviews

760
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,880
together with your actual persistent

761
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,559
cloud access controls and access

762
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,039
monitoring in that so it does disconnect

763
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,120
and abstract it away which means that

764
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
it's more obscure which means that more

765
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,880
things can hide

766
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,840
can be hidden here this is this is how

767
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,919
um

768
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,080
well i forgot forgot the term apt 2029

769
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,480
got in basically by just piggy packing

770
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,880
on existing service service principles

771
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,039
on azure active directory that were

772
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,000
created either by developers or just by

773
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,559
business users when they were taking in

774
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,000
basically basically

775
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,159
software as a service applications and

776
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,399
and just saying give me single sign-on

777
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,520
to my

778
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,919
whatever hootsuite or or whatever i'm

779
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,799
using

780
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,399
behind the scenes if they had the power

781
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,320
to do it in a self-service way they

782
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
basically got a service principle on the

783
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,960
azure active directory with fixed set of

784
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,799
credentials no one looked at those keys

785
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,480
it wasn't done centrally because again

786
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,640
the first bullet or first box was

787
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,039
integrating with existing im as

788
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,600
processes on our organization noah look

789
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,679
at looked at those things when when you

790
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,679
actually got in there you could create

791
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,760
regenerate your own permissions you

792
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,480
could generate your own keys to do other

793
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,840
stuff in the same environment

794
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,760
and that brings us to detection and

795
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,000
monitoring part of course tons of logs

796
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,760
tons of new information that we didn't

797
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,080
have before we need to figure out where

798
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,399
where and how and if to store all of

799
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,720
these things we need to add machine

800
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,120
learning to throw us some alerts from

801
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,080
here

802
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,000
and we need to somehow integrate all of

803
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,360
that with our existing sim and sock

804
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,919
which brings us to

805
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,559
some sort of centralized cloud logging

806
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
architecture uh this is one example

807
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,159
where um

808
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,159
the azure logos but the same is true

809
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,320
with everywhere everywhere else i

810
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,080
mentioned that you will have more than

811
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,960
more

812
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,360
at least one landing zone where you have

813
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,440
those applications those

814
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,679
applications which are a combination of

815
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,159
pre-built products

816
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,320
a landing zone can be a subscription or

817
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,600
an account in aws world and most likely

818
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
you will have some sort of a centralized

819
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
one where you don't have all of your

820
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,080
developers accessing uh your your logs

821
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,520
and then you need to figure out how do

822
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,480
you ship those logs from from those uh

823
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,799
more or less isolated application

824
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,120
specific or however you

825
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,000
divided this

826
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,159
those accounts and subscriptions how do

827
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,480
you ship those logs um

828
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,000
is there a cost impact is there a

829
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,399
cross-cloud impact is there a

830
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,440
retention or compliance impact and if i

831
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,559
decide that i store more stuff in my

832
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,960
application subscriptions in those log

833
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
environments that's great that's more

834
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,720
useful for my developers and that kind

835
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,960
of shifts their responsibility to them

836
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,679
but what if i need to do uh

837
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,360
incident recovery what if i need to do

838
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,760
some sort of forensics work do i have a

839
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,799
place of

840
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,559
do i have a system in place where those

841
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,679
centralized folks or whoever is that uh

842
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,279
that set of people who are doing this

843
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,320
incident

844
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,640
uh and and forensics work

845
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,399
how do they get how will they get access

846
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,440
to to those uh isolated or decentralized

847
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,320
logs and is it is it an on-demand type

848
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,919
of approach or is the persistent

849
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,679
approach if they have persistent access

850
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,519
to my application logs

851
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,840
that that might be hard for for my

852
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,080
certification or audit purposes

853
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,919
and

854
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,360
there is still the networking question

855
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,919
it's not just one magical cloud

856
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,399
there is the cross subscription

857
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,720
networking which i just kind of opened

858
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,679
up that do i send all of those logs on

859
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,559
the previous picture across the backbone

860
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,760
of my csp or do i have some sort of vpn

861
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
or do i have do i have something

862
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,600
specific on the cloud environment to

863
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
secure the connection in transit in a

864
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,159
way that meets my

865
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,840
compliance requirements and in a way

866
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,519
that doesn't add

867
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,880
additional cost or slowness to the

868
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,399
to the implementation there what's

869
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,600
happened if i

870
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,320
need to use multiple uh regions of my

871
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
cloud provider and what happens if i

872
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,880
need to transfer those

873
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,120
into my own premise needing to do hybrid

874
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,000
uh cloud connectivity what if i need to

875
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,120
do connectivity between my aws azure and

876
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,919
google environments and what happens if

877
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,799
if one of my sas vendors uh is big

878
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,120
enough that they they burned their own

879
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,519
networking structure if i'm using stuff

880
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,399
like

881
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,159
i don't know palantir for exam for

882
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,960
example that's hosted in some

883
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
some one of these

884
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,880
big csps i need to figure out how do i

885
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,320
get my my existing

886
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,200
landing zones in that csp connected into

887
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,159
that more or less multi-tenant or shared

888
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,679
environment of my sas provider

889
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,120
and then of course we have this

890
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,279
application level traffic that's kind of

891
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,799
uh something that we we should be

892
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,120
familiar with web application firewalls

893
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,080
ddos protection etc only the so the

894
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,320
problem area is familiar it might be

895
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,080
that the fact that everyone is doing

896
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
this now in a self-service way that

897
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,080
might might be the

898
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,559
headache there it might be the fact that

899
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,159
we need to have some sort of way of

900
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,519
controlling all of our

901
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,240
rule sets for example across all of our

902
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,640
web application firewalls if we allow

903
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,519
people to use their own

904
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,200
and how do we do this in a kind of cloud

905
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,559
native cloud-native way

906
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,039
which brings me to the

907
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,039
fourth part

908
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,320
i basically alluded to uh to this

909
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
animations are a bit wobbly a little

910
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,159
spoilers there but that's fine i

911
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,919
basically alluded to this first problem

912
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,679
area of how do we integrate with our

913
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,960
existing uh enterprise im it could be

914
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,600
that we have very elaborate processes

915
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,840
very elaborate tools uh already in place

916
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,399
for each of the roles uh for each of the

917
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,320
applications that we

918
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
uh we might have we

919
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,320
might have done years of work on stuff

920
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,279
like sap where we have very granular

921
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,000
level roles defined and defined very

922
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,840
specifically what happens kind of in an

923
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,320
end-to-end life cycle perspective of

924
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
privileged users regular users and all

925
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
of those different roles with their

926
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,960
externals internals what if they they

927
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,119
move uh move to a different unit but

928
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,280
still stay internal

929
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,918
all of those uh all of that kind of

930
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,000
existing work that we've done

931
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,879
now somehow needs to catch up with the

932
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,800
hundreds of different role types

933
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
available on the cloud environments

934
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,280
and with the concept of not just having

935
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,560
this one

936
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,800
landing zone level role which is kind of

937
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,960
a dc admin type of type of role but

938
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,760
going very very granular potentially

939
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,159
even in the level of

940
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,280
a single

941
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,520
a single cloud database resource that we

942
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,800
have might have their own own role types

943
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,480
available for them

944
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
and our typical database admin might

945
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,960
need that role but they might also need

946
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,440
a reader role in a wider scope and

947
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,520
that's basically the kind of the

948
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,879
business role composition becomes a very

949
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,800
taxing process if we want to do it

950
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,680
exactly the same way and as manual as we

951
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,720
did for all of this existing uh stuff

952
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,280
that we had

953
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,520
um the same goes again with these

954
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
unmanaged accounts especially the

955
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,040
service principles

956
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,400
similar type of accounts where

957
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,079
when the first time you started using

958
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,839
using your cloud environment you asked

959
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,480
like hey can i get a a service account

960
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,440
created for my aws account or

961
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
service principle created for my azure

962
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,280
azure subscription so that i can deploy

963
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,000
my ci cd from there if you don't by

964
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,599
default if you don't do anything

965
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,079
anything and if it's old enough uh those

966
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,520
search basically

967
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,920
those credentials basically don't expire

968
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,760
you need to manage those credentials how

969
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
how do you actually

970
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,000
get access there now nowadays they fixed

971
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
a little bit on some of this so the

972
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,200
default expiry dates uh in in gui are

973
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,359
short but there's no such thing actually

974
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,520
for example on service principle

975
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,119
aside there's no such thing on the

976
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,040
actual api level so if you still have

977
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
the same code that creates them

978
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,880
you're you're out of luck

979
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,960
and and again our guest accounts

980
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,359
federated accounts our

981
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,240
if we

982
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,480
buy or sell a part of our business we

983
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,880
need to maybe carve out a piece of our

984
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,640
our identities there as well

985
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,200
so you basically need to uh create some

986
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,599
sort of a concept of a

987
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,160
cloud account vending machine

988
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,480
that makes you get your developer some

989
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,240
sort of a self-service way of getting

990
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,560
access getting the proper type of access

991
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,040
maybe even defining that access on their

992
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,079
own

993
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,960
uh

994
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
instead of you doing that pre-work for

995
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,440
them maybe they just submit a pull

996
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
request and the security work is

997
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,200
actually you're reviewing the specific

998
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,760
role description and uh doing that

999
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,400
analyst an analysis there rather than

1000
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,079
you trying to figure out

1001
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,880
uh before they they use what type of

1002
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,079
roles they should be getting

1003
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,640
and then automating automating that

1004
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,720
so

1005
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
trying to speed up

1006
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,240
on the multi-cloud side and even even in

1007
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,880
a

1008
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,440
in a single cloud multi subscription uh

1009
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,760
just a larger larger environment uh

1010
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,839
inventory and asset management becomes

1011
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,839
uh a big question because we don't know

1012
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,040
what

1013
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
we might not even know what we need to

1014
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,440
control we might not if you recall that

1015
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,599
that omigod case uh

1016
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,839
we might had might have had the idea

1017
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,520
that we had a ton of vms in our

1018
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,680
environment but did we had an inventory

1019
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,480
of

1020
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,040
all of all of those cloud cloud solution

1021
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,400
provider provisioned uh agents and and

1022
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,560
configurations on those images that were

1023
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,640
provisioned for us did we have an

1024
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,480
inventory of all of those

1025
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,320
all of the versions that we that are

1026
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,839
deployed there

1027
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,359
where was that up today did we

1028
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,800
understand that we are the ones who need

1029
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,280
to patch that um

1030
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,040
sometimes yes

1031
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,320
containers

1032
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,079
seems to be pretty much the standard way

1033
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,400
of deploying stuff now that's great we

1034
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,280
need to understand uh if you have a kind

1035
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,800
of modern cspm there we have most likely

1036
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
great scans available of of our of the

1037
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,440
vulnerabilities of the containers

1038
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,359
when they were created or built

1039
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,920
are these are these alerts now relevant

1040
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,160
still five years later or a year later

1041
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,920
what are we actually which of these

1042
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,000
images are we actually running in our

1043
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,400
cloud and how do we make that make that

1044
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,240
connection that's that's the part that

1045
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,119
we

1046
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,839
we do need to

1047
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,599
figure out again are we doing this in a

1048
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,599
cloud database or are we doing this in

1049
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,400
the

1050
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,480
kind of using the tools provided by the

1051
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,040
cloud vendor or we do we need to somehow

1052
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,160
integrate that tool into our uh existing

1053
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,079
uh that information into our existing

1054
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,119
inventory

1055
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,200
and asset management basically

1056
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,040
do we have some sort of a web hook that

1057
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,440
whenever we deploy a new container in

1058
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
our in our thousands of different

1059
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,000
subscriptions in in some kubernetes

1060
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,320
managed cuban in this cluster how do we

1061
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,359
get that information of a new new pod is

1062
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,480
uh

1063
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,560
pulling in a new container image how

1064
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,839
does that information get into our

1065
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,160
s-bomb whatever we will have in the in

1066
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,880
the future of a collection of

1067
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,320
what are we actually

1068
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,000
using in production right now

1069
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,320
there's new vulnerabilities in csps uh

1070
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,280
we saw uh both on on azure we saw on

1071
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,160
cosmos we saw on aws we saw on lambda

1072
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,359
there's there's tons of new

1073
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,680
vulnerabilities as there's more use we

1074
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,280
get more disclosures of new

1075
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,520
vulnerabilities of the csps themselves

1076
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,440
cells and again we need to understand

1077
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,280
what have we configured

1078
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,680
that has been our responsible

1079
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,160
and now that we haven't

1080
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,480
haven't done any controls ourselves on

1081
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,000
the part that they were they were

1082
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,480
responsible of we basically just need to

1083
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,640
understand what is the impact when when

1084
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,720
will they go when are they going to

1085
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,760
patch that

1086
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,480
and is there an impact for us

1087
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,720
and then we had these new signals from

1088
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,560
cloud health kind of new maintenance

1089
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
events new scaling events all of those

1090
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,880
events it's very hard to kind of find

1091
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,040
any type of insights from that noise we

1092
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,640
need to basically take into some new

1093
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,280
products which have machine learning and

1094
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,599
all sort of

1095
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,079
pre-filtering and playbooks available in

1096
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,240
in there

1097
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,960
we talked about shared responsibility we

1098
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
talked about omigod quite a quite a bit

1099
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,560
um

1100
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,240
and this concept of

1101
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,000
of we are just doing this for that we

1102
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
don't need to

1103
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,119
uh do this properly because we are not

1104
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,240
yet using production data

1105
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,200
well attackers of of course don't care

1106
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,599
and also the public doesn't care if

1107
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,560
whenever you you have a

1108
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,119
management port publicly open in in your

1109
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,359
environment on the public cloud and that

1110
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,440
is somehow linked to your business

1111
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,200
they're still at minimum the

1112
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,000
reputational risk if nothing else

1113
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,480
in there and believe believe you me you

1114
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,200
will be found out whenever you provision

1115
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,599
something within five minutes

1116
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,880
you will have

1117
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,760
everyone knocking uh on on your door

1118
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,119
there

1119
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,440
and this is basically where this uh

1120
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,319
software bill of materials uh could

1121
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,040
maybe help potentially let's see

1122
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,240
how how do we how do we get a better

1123
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,079
integration from from all of our

1124
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,920
different vendors in in this space

1125
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,800
two minutes for q a and very fast

1126
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,280
switch of a speaker at the same time

1127
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,000
thank you very much and i'm gonna take

1128
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,240
some questions
