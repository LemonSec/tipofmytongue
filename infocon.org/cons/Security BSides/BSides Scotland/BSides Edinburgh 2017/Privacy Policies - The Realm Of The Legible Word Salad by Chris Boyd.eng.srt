1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:08,660
thank you basically here<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a short</font>

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,940
sweet hundred thirteen tears yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,310
going to talk about privacy policies you

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,880
lose a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things related to mobile</font>

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:19,130
and desktop part of history of some of

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,570
the more terrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bueller's and privacy</font>

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,570
policies over that we've seen down the

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,250
years so without further ado let's get

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,310
into it and basically as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see here</font>

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,310
there are no<font color="#E5E5E5"> escapes from adverts and</font>

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:37,300
longer this is this is a screenshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:39,858
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Minecraft globe on tablet and they've</font>

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,199
integrated their adverts into the actual

14
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:43,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">game mechanics so whereas previously you</font>

15
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:46,909
know you could block ads you could stop

16
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:48,199
at popping ads with certain security

17
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:50,629
tools on your phone or on your mobile

18
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,120
here you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're about to die</font>

19
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,858
want to be saved by viewing an ad yes

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,958
save me and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop and after that</font>

21
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:59,089
you can carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> on playing no let me die</font>

22
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:01,549
Angie<font color="#E5E5E5"> died and you don't see an advert</font>

23
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:03,979
terrible so things like this are now

24
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,950
very very popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly in mobile</font>

25
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:09,560
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> increasingly on desktop games</font>

26
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,940
and you know what do you do about this

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,370
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> escape this because</font>

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,530
ultimately most of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> games are free</font>

29
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:19,040
supposedly well they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make money</font>

30
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow and they do this by add-ons app</font>

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,880
packs and primarily advert so in terms

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of euler's and privacy policies what is</font>

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,490
a you low because you know you hear this

34
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,830
term bandied about a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what</font>

35
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,509
actually is it at the end user license

36
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,399
agreement and it's effectively the nuts

37
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,200
and bolts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mechanics of opting into</font>

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,560
things opting out of things the right to

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,560
use copy or not these were very very

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,570
popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> in prominent four five six years</font>

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago if you loaded up say a video game</font>

42
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,990
you would always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> euro ran down</font>

43
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,120
your throat now it's changing a little

44
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,460
bit because more often than not you'll

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,500
see a Terms of Service and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy take precedence so the terms of</font>

47
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,250
services generally how you can use

48
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,990
things and as I said it will replace<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

49
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,180
eula on the mobile if you load up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

50
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,850
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> game you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never see a EULA you</font>

51
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn to see a tons of service or</font>

52
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:10,120
primarily the privacy policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so this</font>

53
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:14,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how you know they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make use of your</font>

54
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,450
ppi so your pii ppi's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> total sales</font>

55
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:16,830
thing involving lots of

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,410
report some banks you don't want to go

57
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,050
there and the frequently incorporate the

58
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,190
bins of the terms of service so the

59
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,260
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's very</font>

60
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult more often than off for an end</font>

61
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,000
user or someone who feels burned by a

62
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,799
program or an app to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal action</font>

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,569
because of a EULA that would you answer

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,010
privacy policies you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

65
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,390
everyone's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be super hot on this</font>

66
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,280
in terms of what they do with your data

67
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,510
will they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do it when they store it</font>

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,220
what's going to happen if they lose they

69
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,920
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies are routinely</font>

70
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,160
dragged into court because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> one key</font>

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,500
privacy policies you know euler's and

72
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,750
things like that not so much so privacy

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,000
policies are a really big deal in mobile

74
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,250
and and but the problem is is there more

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,200
often than not you'll get a yes no in

76
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,760
the app or the program you know have you

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,500
read our Terms of Service have you read

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,929
our privacy policy of course you haven't

79
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,079
and more often than not be the the

80
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,000
privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy is hosted elsewhere so if</font>

81
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,220
you're looking you'll gather that you'll

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,970
click a button and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will open up the</font>

83
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,709
the privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy on a third party</font>

84
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,359
website and that's assuming the website

85
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,590
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> there if it's offline if</font>

86
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,359
they've taken it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down for maintenance</font>

87
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,340
technically you haven't seen the thing

88
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,290
so realistically you can't actually say

89
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,760
yes I've read everything I want to

90
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,798
install this game and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

91
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> games are rained the kids are a</font>

92
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,130
huge chunk of games on the the play

93
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,010
store if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know three years and all</font>

94
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,239
and as I'm sure somewhere intimately

95
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,608
familiar with there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,870
than passing the Kidder a tablet with a

97
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,980
game on to keep them busy while you're

98
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,950
cooking dinner or doing something

99
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,388
important and of course then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

100
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,608
these these stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the mail or</font>

101
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,930
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kids then go on to buy</font>

102
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:51,420
thousands of pounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth in</font>

103
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,730
downloadable content so I more often<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

104
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,708
we do miss the important stuff and we

105
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,388
regularly just click through everything

106
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the game without knowing what</font>

107
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,620
we're actually signing up for so with

108
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,089
that in mind and i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a quick look</font>

109
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,980
at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the older users out there</font>

110
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,329
this one's brilliant this is something

111
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,099
called victor records victor records

112
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:14,280
used to make records around 1902 to 1908

113
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,660
1909 a thing and on the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our some</font>

120
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,750
says a

two dollars into twenty dollars per

122
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,400
dozen when sold in lots of one dozen or

123
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,650
more no licenses granted to use this

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,349
record when sold over less price so

125
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,239
technically these times still apply so

126
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,759
if you if you picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a bunch of these</font>

plastic with little bumps and grooves

and if the play we really old creaky

133
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,639
songs that probably doesn't work very

134
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,840
well on the early LP sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,360
interesting that's probably one of the

136
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,609
earliest examples of slightly weird

consequences with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EULA that made</font>

139
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,000
sense at the time but very quickly now

make<font color="#CCCCCC"> no sense whatsoever we have a</font>

this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these sorts of rogue apt</font>

you will see whether the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red boxes</font>

medicinal change this year which I'll

333
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,260
get to in a minute for this is this is

334
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,029
how it should work on Google Play so you

335
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,680
know you click the read more you scroll

336
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,080
down and there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a link to either</font>

337
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,810
a user agreement or privacy policy so

338
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,160
you can see on the right there the

339
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,660
invisible privacy policy from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">nap is no words you can click that you</font>

341
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,430
can go off you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and that's</font>

342
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,750
how it should work and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's</font>

343
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,160

action so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> April again weirdly</font>

346
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,270
it's almost a similar amount of words

347
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,979
across the five apps so you've got from

they announced they're going to start

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,650
clamping down on apps they have no

358
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,600

<font color="#E5E5E5">data you should have one of these there</font>

362
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,520
and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start removing apps</font>

363
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,980
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Play Store so this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

the emails they sent oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll record</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

365
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,880
your your app with packaging blah blah

366
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,430
currently violates our user data policy

367
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,230
we need a violent privacy policy please

368
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,000
resolve x marks the 15th or

369
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,900
administrative action will be taken to

370
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,630
limit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> visit</font>

371
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,310
the of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> app but there's still lots</font>

372
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,900
of apps out there on google play that

373
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,699
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find right now that don't seem</font>

374
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,620
to have a privacy policy listed or

375
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,470
indeed anything else use agreements all

376
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,590
the rest of it so it remains to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

377
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:33,100
how hard my google play I've actually

378
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:36,370
hid these developers so in terms of the

379
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,250
old mobile gaming value proposition this

380
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,980
is this is Texas this is catch us on the

381
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,050
app store for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mobile there's</font>

382
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like between 10 and 50 million</font>

383
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,709
installs of this game up to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

384
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,170
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ridiculous amount of</font>

385
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,510
installed again you know kid friendly so

386
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,520
it's aged three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> Naboth and of</font>

387
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,140
course it contains ads and in-app

388
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,430
purchases which are getting these in-app

389
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,560
purchases or where they make all the

390
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,949
cash but we shouldn't ignore the advert

391
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,939
and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the day I went off and</font>

392
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:08,410
had a look to see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many ad companies</font>

393
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,090
you would have to read through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all their</font>

394
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,589
privacy policies you lose and all the

395
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,600
rest of it able to sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say yep</font>

396
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,550
I've read all of these I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font>

397
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,650
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with my information giving</font>

398
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,859
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tetris please and I was amazed to</font>

399
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:24,370
find that they had 53 separate companies

400
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,770
listed on a big huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of the you</font>

401
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,350
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advertising companies the they</font>

402
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,870
effectively partner with<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty one of</font>

403
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,730
these had no walked out on the list it

404
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,040
literally just said not applicable well

405
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay does that mean because they aren't</font>

406
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,630
they build and they haven't bothered to

407
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,130
do one or you know what I am I unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

408
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually ourselves from whatever it is</font>

409
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're doing you know then the</font>

410
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete lack of information means I</font>

411
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,720
can't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> an informed decision not a</font>

412
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,310
judgment about what's going on there was

413
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,870
one list that there's an uninstall which

414
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,699
is quite weird because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you've</font>

415
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,650
already installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tetris on your mobile</font>

416
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,500
you you're not installing anything else

417
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,240
so quite why one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these was listed as</font>

418
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,880
an uninstall with a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an</font>

419
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,490
uninstaller I don't know and for privacy

420
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,680
policies were offline or basically

421
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,390
unreachable so either the site was down

422
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,770
or it was a page not found or it

423
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,680
redirected you to some holistic

424
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,290
marketing website and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again you</font>

425
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,109
couldn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out what what they</font>

426
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,219
were doing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data and until you</font>

427
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,060
have to read through something like

428
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">eighty 3808 words across 49 policies and</font>

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,630
you ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to say yep I've</font>

431
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:34,140
read it all I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to play some</font>

432
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:37,420
Tetris now which ridiculous frankly

433
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,460
seven hours 45 minutes to read at an

434
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,750
average of three words per second that

435
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">would that would take it to plan through</font>

436
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:47,320
just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to play some Tetris so</font>

437
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:49,570
here's a screenshot of the list of ad

438
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,520
companies if you like so they have name

439
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,290
of the company on the utmost last and

440
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,970
you've got privacy policy first of all

441
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> any off that with if applicable on</font>

442
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,050
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right hand column so as you can</font>

443
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,120
see it's quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of quite a lot of</font>

444
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,400
texture quite all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the links quite a</font>

445
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,950
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies 53 of them in total so</font>

446
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">I decided to revisit the tail end of</font>

447
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:13,510
last year and see exactly how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

448
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:15,760
the one out so in 2016 you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

449
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,300
it you know visually you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

450
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,550
they've added quite a few more the text

451
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,370
is smaller there's a lot more companies

452
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,650
listed there in both columns you will

453
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,030
notice that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scrollbar</font>

454
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:31,750
probably on the right of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because</font>

455
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:37,750
yep they a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more so actually it's</font>

456
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:39,910
gone from 53 to 212 so there are now 212

457
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:43,600
companies that where you have to read a

458
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:46,060
privacy policy or you know au lait or

459
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,420
some other thing and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's opt</font>

460
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:52,660
outs and all the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> o just to be able</font>

461
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,430
to play some Tetris and it's now divided

462
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,719
into four separate sections so that one

463
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,050
there with the boxer lambda is the

464
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,270
mobile advertising section that has 75

465
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,709
but there's no real indicator now I

466
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,290
looked and looked and looked I couldn't

467
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">find any indicator on be the EA website</font>

468
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,359
the the tetris page the google play

469
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,490
store know where that said you only have

470
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:15,250
to read the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile chunk which is</font>

471
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,680
still 75 and even if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> include</font>

472
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,119
the rest of them so so you know am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

473
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,500
I supposed to read them over ones am I

474
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,879
supposed to read the desktop ones are

475
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,750
they all interconnected do they do the

476
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,720
same thing who knows well from 2012 to

477
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,010
2016 it's gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one group to four</font>

478
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,990
separate distinct groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got</font>

479
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,060
online advertising online analytics

480
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,040
mobile advertising and mobile analytics

481
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,760
which is a three hundred percent

482
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,220
increase

483
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,410
in the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies listed in</font>

484
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,430
just four years which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

485
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:47,200
staggering so I decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

486
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:51,010
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many words I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have to</font>

487
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,260
lead through now to see you know well

488
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,410
how many words having in terms of

489
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,760
conditions the the technical level of

490
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,590
the words involved because more often

491
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,290
binoculars are written at a very high

492
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,030
level of English and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you rub them</font>

493
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,800
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the online analyzer</font>

494
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,530
tools that gives you an idea of the

495
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,030
complexity level of these bees you lose

496
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,190
more often than not they're there at

497
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:15,340
least college level and typically a

498
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:18,400
university level the pretty complex

499
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,620
documents so here's my disclaimer before

500
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I get to the numbers because I tried to</font>

501
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,830
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> conservative with my estimates for</font>

502
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,590
this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't want to over</font>

503
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,540
blowing so keep in mind that the numbers

504
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,429
I've got here are actually probably a

505
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,190
bit less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual calibers</font>

506
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,900
reasons for this statistics on rulers

507
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,280
are hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find I was going to compare</font>

508
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,900
and contrast with others for these

509
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,879
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of how many</font>

510
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">words are involved what you've got to</font>

511
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,080
plan through to install an app or play a

512
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">game but there really aren't any out</font>

513
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">there people have done studies on you</font>

514
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,880
losing the complexity level of the words

515
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,280
and things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of</font>

516
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,060
sheer numbers shared bums on seats what

517
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,129
am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to wade through</font>

518
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,590
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

519
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,570
can find click here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see more I</font>

520
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,310
haven't included those because a lot of

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did the privacy policies are</font>

522
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,340
just you know it's a page with a bunch

523
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,800
of texts great that's easy for me to

524
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">catalog move on to the next one there's</font>

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,020
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a man that that again the you</font>

526
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,580
get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy policy page and then</font>

527
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,430
you find out that their privacy policy

528
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,169
is affiliated<font color="#E5E5E5"> or connected to dozens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

529
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:19,510
other companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> at felt so then you have</font>

530
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,370
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these boxes and scroll bars and</font>

531
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,500
things that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click into and</font>

532
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,120
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> drag over and read all that text</font>

533
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,920
and you've lost count with this then you

534
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,560
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost there or you have to click away</font>

535
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,810
to another bunch of sites and I didn't

536
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,639
want to go you know I basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there</font>

537
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,460
forever if I click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy policy</font>

538
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">then start that chain than the daisy</font>

539
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,900
chain of anglers privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy so my</font>

540
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,700
rule of thumb would do is to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick</font>

541
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,610
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first page that I hate if it's</font>

542
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,220
a clean page of text<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great if it</font>

543
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't then it's beyond the realms of my</font>

544
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,800
sanity and time frankly

545
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,420
to get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even even that the</font>

546
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,120
technical challenges of<font color="#CCCCCC"> planting all the</font>

547
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,190
words is tricky because as I'm sure you

548
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,949
know you can paste in a bunch of text

549
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,809
into two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different word process to word</font>

550
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,820
processors to getting texts counters and

551
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:10,000
it will give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> different results so a</font>

552
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,899
lot of word counter tools will will flag

553
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,790
the first example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as as one word</font>

554
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,240
some of them will flag it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as one</font>

555
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:22,120
words bill and vice versa so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

556
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,040

558
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,899
it's if it's a word that gets a hit on

559
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the decanter romantic because you can</font>

560
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,780
stick all of these words<font color="#E5E5E5"> into different</font>

different<font color="#E5E5E5"> over inflated estimates and</font>

563
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,300
finally deciding a dead on arrival for

564
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,300
the purposes of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've flanked any</font>

website that gives me a 404 error

566
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,120
consistently so I go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">websites at least twice to make sure</font>

568
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,229
that they didn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a quick</font>

569
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,809
period of downtown or something if the

570
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,809
site is basically 40 Ford and gone then

571
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:57,879
it's a dla if it redirects to a horrific

572
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,889
shrieking advertising site and I had a

573
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,320
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those then that's classed as a</font>

574
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,120
dla okay if it just if the site is over

575
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,309
it gives me a page not found or redirect

576
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,750
me to their<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs profile with a nice</font>

577
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:13,090
photograph it's at the LA frankly so

578
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:17,320
with that in mind let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> move on to the</font>

579
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:19,149
horrific word salad the online

583
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,550
listed eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of them were working</font>

one on applicable and 37 of them were

DOAs which is kind of bad really online

588
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,149
analytics so the analytics firm yeah the

589
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,490
advertising firms give you the adverts

590
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,559
the analytics and number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 adverts</font>

591
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,760
behind the scenes so they help<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

hitting the ads when were like it blokes

594
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,020
that's effectively and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll have the</font>

597
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,970
they serve them the kind of demographics

598
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,830
that they serve them through so

599
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,169
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will see more enterprises</font>

600
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,330
with most of these programs and

601
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,859
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analytics fans because</font>

602
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,809
it's full loaded with ads and then

603
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:10,509
they've got smaller companies behind the

604
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:12,879
scenes doing the number crunching so the

605
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:14,499
15<font color="#E5E5E5"> online analytics plans able working</font>

612
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:39,100
these things were AWOL from the internet

613
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:41,859
and in terms of mobile analytics<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> six not applicable opt-out and</font>

three of those sites just<font color="#E5E5E5"> failed to</font>

616
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:50,529
resolve so these days aren't great

617
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:52,509
numbers really all<font color="#E5E5E5"> things considered so</font>

618
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,299
I've handily<font color="#E5E5E5"> color-coded these things</font>

619
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:58,509

620
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:00,129
non-applicable and red for dead so in

621
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,960
terms of online advertising you can see

622
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:04,330
sixty-eight percent of them were fine

623
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,809
and effectively thirty percent were

624
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:11,799
missing in action online analytics again

625
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:14,230
53 were fine and the other chunk is made

626
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,899
or proof non-applicable and broken web

627
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,070
pages the mobile advertising which is

628
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:20,229
all you believe the most important one

629
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:25,119
ear so the purposes of you know this

630
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:28,029
Tetris game is shocking frankly yeah the

631
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:31,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty-three percent actually work and</font>

635
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,309
incredible and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mobile</font>

636
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:43,840
analytics only thirty-five percent are

637
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,129
actually functionals the rest of them

638
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,350
you does nothing for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk down</font>

639
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:50,769
cause there's no way c to opt out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

640
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,748
all the site is dead these aren't great

641
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:54,879
numbers really considering the amount of

642
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:57,519
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they list on me you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the page for most of these that'd be</font>

644
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,639
so horrific<font color="#CCCCCC"> alee broken is is</font>

645
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:06,460
unbelievable so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actual word</font>

646
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:07,959
count I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you roughly you</font>

647
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,909
know what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of book you could go off</font>

648
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,609
and leave instead of jamming these

649
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:14,259
privacy policies Daniel eyeball so the

650
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:14,649
online advertising waving their children

651
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:16,300
for

652
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,230
on sales and work you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go out and</font>

653
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick up east of eden which is a nice</font>

654
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:25,960
225,000 and it would take you roughly 21

655
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,940
hours and 25 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read all of</font>

656
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,780
those words in that collection of

657
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,150
privacy policies in terms of online

658
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,860
analytics<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty-four thousand words</font>

659
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,070
there so you could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and rather</font>

660
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,659
appropriately pick up Fahrenheit 451

661
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,520
ahem which is almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same</font>

662
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,260
word camp and that would take you a much

663
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,260
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> moderate four hours and five</font>

664
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,390
minutes to get through I think I'd stick

665
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,010
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> fell in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right to be honest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I</font>

666
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,260
turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy policies and then</font>

667
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,960
set them on fire I don't know mobile

668
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,400
advertising<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more than doubled up</font>

669
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,640
from the online analytics we've got

670
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,500
80,000 words<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Secret Garden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

671
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly the same word count and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

672
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,470
would take you seven hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 26</font>

673
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,630
minutes to get through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in terms of</font>

674
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,510
mobile analytics we dropped down a bit

675
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,480
so you get 50,000 words rather

676
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,590
appropriately again a wrinkle in time

677
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,060
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big wrinkle in contacted</font>

678
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,879
personally honest and that would take

679
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,850
you four hours and 41 minutes to get

680
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,320
through so I mean on balance I would

681
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:32,139
stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the library to be perfectly</font>

682
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:34,929
honest so 460,000 and 619 words later we

683
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,440
have 200 to privacy policy companies

684
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:41,170
listed and soul of those 110 work<font color="#CCCCCC"> 36</font>

of yes this privacy policy is here yes

696
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:17,590
this is a thing so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tally up these</font>

697
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:21,159
numbers again 460,000 619 words across

698
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:23,740
all four sections of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Texas's you know</font>

privacy policy companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's give</font>

you an idea of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ballpark</font>

701
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:31,070
urine with those sorts of numbers

702
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,769
basically George Martin's long does the

to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 thousand words storm of swords</font>

705
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,169
again I would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> stick with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,489
couple more thousand words go to 418 you

709
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,289
got the entirety of the lord of the

710
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:53,269
rings trilogy now keep in mind that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

711
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:54,919
was conservative with my estimates for

a baseline for what was out there with

00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:03,379
the guards how many words were involve

715
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:04,669
so you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you add in</font>

716
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:06,559
all the rest of the more you of the

717
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:08,029
sites or you know if you can imagine a

718
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,700
situation where all of those broken

719
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:13,009
websites actually function you know and

720
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,559
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know or just on</font>

721
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fifty percent I think of all the</font>

00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,700
privacy policies the 212 companies

723
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,739
listed in theory you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could double this</font>

724
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,509
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could end up with maybe a seven</font>

hundred thousand eight hundred thousand

726
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:28,100
words if those websites all worked and

727
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:32,090
most privacy policies tend to come in at

728
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:34,580
Randy the 500 word range about 500 to

729
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,678
about 1300 ish and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you get these</font>

730
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,428
crazy outliers that can be like 2,000

731
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,259
force it's quite possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you could</font>

732
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:44,869
end up with the entire lord of the rings

733
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:48,109
trilogy and George Martin's longest book

734
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:52,369
combined if all of those those missing

735
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:54,529
pages had actually worked this would

736
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:56,959
take you roughly 22 hours and thousand

737
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:58,519
five minutes or five words per second to

738
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,009
play through all of those privacy

739
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,460
policies I was actually going to you

740
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:07,220
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill myself reading all of these</font>

741
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,830
privacy policies and I think I got to

742
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,139
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour and a half and unjust</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

743
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:14,869
it was for a braver soul than I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

744
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:17,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait so many hours for so little return</font>

745
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:19,580
frankly but it's yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's absolutely</font>

746
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:22,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">crazy if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you read a little bit</font>

747
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:25,158
slowest on three words a second 1337

748
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:29,929
hours and 39 minutes or three words a

749
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:32,239
second well you know if you do read it

750
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:33,919
one where the second and you really want

751
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:35,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play Tetris you can wave goodbye</font>

752
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,019
through a hundred plus hours of your

753
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,019
life

754
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,759
but now at last you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually play</font>

755
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:44,710
Tetris so fantastic you've you've taken

756
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,850
and all those privacy policies you

757
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,789
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're going to do with</font>

758
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:52,120
a data yep load<font color="#CCCCCC"> that up and flying it</font>

759
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:54,970
off fantastic or not to be more accurate

760
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,090
so I mean in terms of conclusions of

761
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,590
this horrific bout of<font color="#E5E5E5"> number-crunching</font>

762
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,850
see I actually feel sorry for the

763
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,189
companies that have to put these things

764
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,139
together because ultimately they have to

765
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,820
write these horrific diatribes or they

766
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:08,678
will get sued by somebody although

767
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,899
something will go wrong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're get</font>

768
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,820
into lots of trouble and you can't

769
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:15,459
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> win if you've got a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

770
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:18,789
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy it probably misses things</font>

771
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,320
out the clever a person and I can go but

772
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:23,230
actually and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into trouble</font>

773
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write these big huge eye watering</font>

774
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,100
slabs of text then people aren't going

775
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:31,059
to read past the first two paragraphs

776
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,799
nobody reads these things and you know

777
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:34,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will continue to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run read these</font>

778
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,240
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what companies some companies</font>

779
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:40,659
do like what we do and some of the

780
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,210
others they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a you</font>

781
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:45,039
lepage privacy policy page and they have

782
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,350
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legalese down on the left hand</font>

783
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,809
side and then they will have the plain

784
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">English version so what each of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

785
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,850
sections actually means for all of us

786
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:57,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here but don't have more degrees on</font>

787
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,840
the right so we we do that with our you

788
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">know terms of service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the rest</font>

789
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,439
of it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a bit of a boom in there</font>

790
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,789
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back it became very</font>

791
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,580
chunky for some reason and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

792
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:08,440
everybody just stop doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again but</font>

793
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing can help and</font>

794
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,940
it's also very useful for companies that

795
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,730
you know if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put together a</font>

796
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,460
privacy policies until I know yourselves

797
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:20,169
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the non legal people</font>

798
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,240
to sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the legal people and</font>

799
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:23,649
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together these plain English version</font>

800
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,539
and ask them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put together these plain</font>

801
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:28,209
English versions because it's much

802
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:29,740
easier to think I hang on you miss this

803
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,840
this thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing what about that</font>

804
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,700
someone asks are there then then it's

805
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,399
the legal person just gives you this

806
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:39,039
huge block of text and you go well as

807
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,799
I'm just stick it on the website so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

808
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:45,039
plain English thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very very useful</font>

809
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:48,789
where's the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> going who knows I mean</font>

810
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I tried originally this this talk was</font>

811
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:53,379
all about you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the data was</font>

812
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,539
physically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had all these wacky</font>

813
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:57,248
ideas but I was going to map out you

814
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:59,049
know all the points on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> globe where</font>

815
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:01,659
the info was going what we were doing

816
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:03,549
with the data who was being sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I</font>

817
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,830
gave all passed around half an hour it

818
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:08,009
was it was ridiculous because so many of

819
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,360
these companies would then have multiple

820
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:11,700
places where the days would break off

821
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,229
and go through so they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

822
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,109
partnership protection officers in say

823
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,570
Dublin and America and friends and this

824
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:21,399
other place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you knew you were</font>

825
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,739
back to I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thousand</font>

different<font color="#E5E5E5"> website for breakfast and</font>

827
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:28,389
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way to be a particular</font>

828
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:29,529
exactly where the stuff is going because

829
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:31,238
of you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've email and say</font>

00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,919
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you a few pop me an</font>

analytics while I'm playing a game<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

833
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:37,739
know what were you sending this info

834
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,998
they're probably not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

835
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know and then you're going to</font>

836
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:43,330
get bounced around between the five

837
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,730
different privacy officers that they've

838
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,889
got all around the globe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is basically</font>

839
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:51,359
mission impossible to figure out exactly

840
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:53,979
where this information is ending up and

841
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,019
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep in mind all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

842
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,909
words<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a mobile game you're</font>

843
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:59,799
expected to read that 400 sumfin

844
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:03,730
thousand collection of words on this

845
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:05,499
thing and I Drive it doesn't work you

846
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:09,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter what what format</font>

847
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:11,919
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing it does not work so so</font>

848
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,600
clearly we need to come up with some

849
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually present people</font>

850
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,158
with privacy policies and you lose that

851
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:19,539
they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> label</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices</font>

00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:25,090
these gangs on it's bad enough on you

854

know on a desktop of the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen yeah</font>

855
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,658

00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,510
mean to be personally asked I think it's

881
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,920
too early to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell what will happen is</font>

882
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,420
those what normally happens when there's

any major changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

with whatever relevant local laws are

889
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,240

have on the site and you know the thing

895
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,889
that the the person oh yeah i mean i

896
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,139
have a technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> background I know my</font>

way<font color="#CCCCCC"> around these Euler's I know all the</font>

898
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:26,450
sort of sneaky weasel<font color="#CCCCCC"> word phrases but</font>

00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies will enter then and the ways</font>

900
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,989
that they will phrase things to make you

901
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,760
think though you know they're looking at

902
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:33,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">the store people they Dave nearly dumped</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of covering their back in a</font>

way that prevents them<font color="#CCCCCC"> from being seeded</font>

906
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:42,949
or whatever and you know I I had major

907
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:44,750
problems trying to make sense of all of

908
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,428
these I mean if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gives my brain</font>

909
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,370
turns almost by the end of it frankly I

910
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,409
can tell you that the v8 privacy

911
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:53,509
policies as they exist I'll you know do

00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">beyond me and I think probably fair to</font>

00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,270
say

918
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:11,189
anyone to be able to honestly sit down

923
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:22,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">see any significant change in terms of</font>

924
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:35,040
benefits for the people playing the

00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:36,300
games unfortunately now no I mean you

926

earlier examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> there now that that's</font>

929
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,029
the way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the old-school Antwoord</font>

00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,980
industry you know the 180 solutions of

931
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,290
diet revenues and all those companies

932
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,880
that's how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain such an initial</font>

933
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,279
foothold and made so many millions

934
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,100
because people just didn't read the

935
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,310
blurb and that nobody reads them you

936
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,690
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you install an update on on</font>

939
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,770
their EULA all over again to read before

940
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,750
you can install the thing and nobody

941
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,869
reads it I mean this does anyone in this

942
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,760
room ever read the eula ever and it has

943
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:18,720

956
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,410
make that much sense just to be able to

957
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,630
say okay I knew the risks before I got

958
