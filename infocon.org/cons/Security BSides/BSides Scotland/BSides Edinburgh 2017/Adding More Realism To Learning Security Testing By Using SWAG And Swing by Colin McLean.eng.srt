00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:08,610
thank you yeah just introduced myself

27 years quite a later time with my

degrees in mechanical engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as</font>

no one ethical hacking probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,620
somebody's I get bored every couple

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">years and want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of go do</font>

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,590
something else everybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,680
thankful being the program chatter art

12

party for their to go up in degree so

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,610
smug<font color="#E5E5E5"> in swing and what are they but</font>

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,850
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple tools that I've</font>

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,989
created for using<font color="#CCCCCC"> were classes in</font>

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,160
slug I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> damn vulnerable a</font>

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,129
little bit overused in hacking so I

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,260
moved it away from their second one

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,629
susceptible windows network generator

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,690
swing so the docs base with all about

23
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,179
what are they why I created them and

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're out the going there's a hell of a</font>

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot future what can these applications</font>

26
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:14,810
ethical have been Albert a well I always

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,339
advertise ourselves as we are vocational

28
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,859
we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to aim at the job market</font>

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,359
make things as real as we possibly can

30
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,949
however teaching security testing web

31
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:30,208
application testing or infrastructure

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,409
testing it can be difficult it's

33
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:33,389
additional where that have done it and

34
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,249
some of some of you who've been an

opportune before a recognized<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

36
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:39,298
faces will recognize those that

37
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,740
essentially what i do is a clear at some

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,200
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of target whether it's web</font>

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,048
applications on a network and hand out

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,869
the same target to everyone and what

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,950
happens is students will collaborate

42
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:51,810
somebody will<font color="#CCCCCC"> find a trick some deal</font>

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,789
find an administrative password then

44
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,380
they go in the pub and kill the mix and

45
00:01:53,789 --> 00:02:00,029
it takes away a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge and</font>

46
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,039
so it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to do that it's much</font>

47
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:04,380
harder to make a general to make it very

48
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenging and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's also topic of</font>

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,449
students practice and feedback all my

50
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:12,030
students want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fantastical so they</font>

51
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,200
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test a network find out what</font>

52
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,790
this should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have found and then try</font>

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,089
another one try another once again

54
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:21,078
you know what was a different destiny I

55
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,549
also try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge security that</font>

56
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:26,189
students in and security as much as a

57
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly can it brings more than just</font>

58
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:30,150
the technical skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think Agatha</font>

59
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,879
is more about other things than just the

60
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,810
technical skills things like exposure to

61
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,220
methodologies project management skills

62
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,680
experimentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills I think a problem</font>

63
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,180
when people have more things by<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

64
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,430
them wrong then getting them right the

65
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,659
first time so as Native students the

66
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,139
environment where they have to test

67
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,849
things they can break things and get it

68
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,310
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then hopefully get it right</font>

69
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,738
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is think outside the</font>

70
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,510
box and so many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said thing is you</font>

71
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,879
can't teach think outside the box skills

72
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,470
and they may or may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a right but</font>

73
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,629
you can certainly put students in the

74
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,650
situation that they have to think

75
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:10,828
outside the box 22 when so that's really

76
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,870
what I want to do so walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> it swag</font>

77
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,560
this good slug version<font color="#CCCCCC"> one its kind of</font>

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:22,349
this was conceived last July and<font color="#CCCCCC"> corfu I</font>

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,970
had 18 18 nights in<font color="#E5E5E5"> corfu and I way by</font>

80
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,488
the pool in the morning and I drunk lots

81
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,260
of alcohol and afternoon but in the

82
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,720
meantime<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when the Sun was the</font>

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">hottest I spent to it I wish there was</font>

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,819
every day right in this application not

85
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,709
sure my partner was too enamored me gone

86
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,250
and holiday and walk in but once the

87
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,079
geek fall was a geek so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at web</font>

88
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,500
application security testing and a lot

89
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,090
you'll recognize these applications

90
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,659
brilliant applications done vulnerable

91
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,720
web app written by Ryan Durst known for

92
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:57,478
years great application mythology<font color="#CCCCCC"> abhi</font>

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">walk and also web caught the fantastic</font>

94
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">trade</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and applications as a lot of</font>

95
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,909
challenges and them growing it however

96
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,970
they're not really will stick web

97
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,769
applications so you cannot perform a

98
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,109
methodology against damn vulnerable

99
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">Weber that's not its design it's not its</font>

100
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:18,209
function so it's not vocational with

101
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,858
anyway because someone getting a job at

102
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,889
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of this would be a fine a</font>

103
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:26,130
methodology to your website reporting

104
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,050
the findings so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

105
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,150
end there also second with solutions are

106
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,530
out there

107
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,299
students are like the rest of us will

108
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,609
take a shortcut so if you can go online

109
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,500
find the solutions then students i'll do

110
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,210
that and a lot little clip<font color="#E5E5E5"> well i would</font>

111
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,100
have found it anyway but the method out

112
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,780
the experimentation skills that they're

113
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,570
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wrong kind of skills that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">that your lamb and also once you've done</font>

115
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,480
DV<font color="#E5E5E5"> wa it's done you can chuck it into</font>

116
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">been basic one so here's the desire</font>

117
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,400
sensory<font color="#E5E5E5"> so know what classes or 40 50</font>

118
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,830
students<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want an individual and</font>

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,530
real-life website as much as possible

120
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,349
for each student or several for each

121
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,450
student and the one them to form a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill</font>

122
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,190
test using the methodology and then do

123
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,890
the further here the documentation at

124
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,050
the park at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end every student hates</font>

125
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,520
doing that but tough the sweat so we'll

126
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,490
both you must document in the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

127
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,260
or real world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one would realize</font>

128
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,260
that application students can attack and

129
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">it won't lots of them and I want them to</font>

130
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:29,010
be vulnerable in different ways I don't

131
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want them to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be tied down when</font>

132
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,599
you're rather than any anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

133
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,070
this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get something that's tied</font>

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,990
down it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an object</font>

135
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,420
quadrants you're not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 very much</font>

136
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,300
so want them to be very vulnerable

137
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:46,080
rather than under long haul so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

138
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the balcony in corfu was I</font>

139
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,479
googled for applications so that will

140
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,250
tell you factually MySQL PHP

141
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,740
applications and see what's out there

142
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,290
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of websites</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

143
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,210
student projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> com which I take it our</font>

144
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,450
student projects that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

145
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,609
and submit as a course look don't ever

146
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,780
do that because same thing of a

147
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,050
technical term for these applications

148
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,330

153
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,820
using any of these and the documentation

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,990
is just they fail a document with it

155
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,270
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them no don't do that so anyway</font>

156
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,890
I started downloading them I did most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

157
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,169
these applications that have died

158
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,180
avoided I fight to fix the code that's

159
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one I'd to make it work what's</font>

160
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,940
the functional it wasn't there I've also

161
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,350
kind of

162
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,090
turn them into a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

163
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,010

164
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">very relevant to this building I feel</font>

165
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,909
like them you know I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any of</font>

166
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,370
the magic wand in this building isn't

167
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,750
bad but anyway so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

168
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,760
applications of data wouldn't use so

169
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,820
we've got school manager system we've

170
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,430
got them a jeweler store in here which

171
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,520
have some din to recast Feliz jewel

172
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,320
jewelry store online career guidance and

173
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,090
they've also got a medical service

174
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,390
specialist<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether promoted to the</font>

175
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:16,440
castle to a doctor I've got a student

176
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:19,740
information system a clinic our web poll

177
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,570
manager and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course no student can</font>

178
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,690
survive without pizza so I thought I'd

179
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,190
being a pizza or the system as well so

180
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,680
these are basically what I would like

181
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,630
them the contrabass applications eight

182
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coded in different styles</font>

183
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,300
which is great so it definitely could in

184
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,099
styles most of her endless each of these

185
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,630
applications has also got lots of

186
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,580
different inherent vulnerabilities

187
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,010
cross-site scripting there's probably

188
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,200
that cane in each of them which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which</font>

189
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,750
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine no has what we want there's</font>

190
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,300
still not enough you know so I needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

191
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,970
do a little better scripting so give me

192
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,500
a good excuse to learn about a Python so

193
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,840
here's here's that the very first

194
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,730
version use this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> student assessment</font>

195
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,380
so you see it generates random websites

196
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,550
for student assessments but just go

197
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,180
through each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parts individually</font>

198
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,310
in here you can see we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> student</font>

199
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,530
what's all six names in an eight it's

200
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,770
created a copy of the jewelry website

201
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,690
for that student copy of food website

202
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,810
for that student so creates a copy of

203
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,000
one of them at random then injects

204
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,030
random vulnerable both its end to that

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,860
student way back and then all the

206
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,349
injected volumes of all stays involved

207
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,260
for me so when I'm marking I can see

208
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,570
what each student was facing but also as

209
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,130
part of feedback I can send them the

210
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">bread and say here's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

211
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,120
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found so a nice a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of</font>

212
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,900
feedback for them and I think feedback

213
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,070
is really important in this this case

214
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,870
here's the current injected vulnerable

215
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,400
face I have not injected cross-site

216
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,839
scripting because they've been so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

217
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,569
so many of the men they're pointless

218
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,070
likes nice little a believe it but

219
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,029
things like super when Jackson proxy

220
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,730
request forgery a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what is in the</font>

221
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:01,170
some that been injected after your folks

222
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,660
so things like director drive-ins out of

223
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,189
there or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not there some are random</font>

224
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,410
will create some or less so for example

225
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,120
each of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Advocate applications have</font>

226
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,430
got an odd mineral game as well as the

227
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,029
standard user login so for the admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font>

228
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:18,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">n I've created a password based on</font>

229
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:19,649
actually txt file some are random so for

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,480
example with super injection

231
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,329
countermeasures<font color="#CCCCCC"> there these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

232
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,010
are a very basic one a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more now so</font>

233
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:27,630
it's going to pick one of these you see

234
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,910
that this one is it says we just felt

235
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:33,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">about when it was one or select on union</font>

236
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,790
in there so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all done at random</font>

237
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,889
just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of detail how I've</font>

238
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,050
done this it's really not rocket science

239
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,269
all I've done is going through the PHP

240
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool in certain places and normalized it</font>

241
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:46,949
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that I login</font>

242
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,829
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> used dollar username and password</font>

243
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:53,370
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PHP and then I put an include</font>

244
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:55,439
file underneath so the cancer measures

245
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,899
the sequel injection there are from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

246
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,449
file and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> script basically creates</font>

247
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,519
that file so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really rocket</font>

248
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:04,769
science there's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look within the</font>

249
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,720
code we're putting tags so my script dog

250
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:10,170
steps through from the tags and replace

251
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,970
the tags with whatever I wanted random

252
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,939
on this was the feedback that was

253
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,350
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a student's pretty basic tip</font>

254
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,329
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I must have known as much</font>

255
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,630
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> now but you can see in here that</font>

256
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:25,310
got hidden source codes messages user

257
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:28,519
enumerations possible admin password is

258
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,869
service in this case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see a</font>

259
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,490
useful feedback but what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> student</font>

260
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,459
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have found when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you put them are</font>

261
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,730
going through it so use them 10 14

262
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,199
assessment what reasonably well probably

263
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,730
too many vulnerabilities but I've got a

264
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:44,069
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good feedback</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the students</font>

265
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,910
in there and kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> also dealt a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

266
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:50,069
bit now but given students of practice

267
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,870
platform is not this is not really

268
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:53,910
fulfilling what I want to do here I

269
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,649
would I would like some kind of

270
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,810
self-contained application where

271
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,069
students can create things and instant

272
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,130
will get feedback and maybe a little

273
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:04,829
better training in there as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> smug</font>

274
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,290
version 2 i'll give you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo</font>

275
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:08,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in a minute but very very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simple</font>

276
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,610
web

277
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,379
interface why is the student to create a

278
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,699
vulnerable web app with<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

279
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,209
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of all of the most days</font>

280
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:21,779
then taste it I get feedback on it so I

281
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:24,138
have a nice day today my laptop fried at

282
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:27,959
eleven o'clock this morning thanks to

283
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:33,629
mari anything Rudy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your laptop so</font>

284
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:36,119
let's hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works so I've got</font>

285
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,360
this running<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I Salim rise to get it</font>

286
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,759
running in a tiny core virtual machines

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,220
so the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is rained about 250</font>

00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:52,290
Meg ceux qui tam it quite amusing screen

289
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:54,420
here will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth right so this is</font>

290

essential here you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those you</font>

00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:06,449
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a kind of base I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see all</font>

295
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,149
vulnerable is a rare no vulnerable is

296
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:10,979
present or<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the vulnerabilities so</font>

297
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,839
I'll just do once they run the

298
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,250
vulnerabilities but in here I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

299
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,500
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a definitely of sequel</font>

300
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,110
injection in there so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make sure</font>

301
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these are definitely on or I could</font>

302
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:28,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">have said no sequel injection yeah so</font>

303
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:30,660
can do that create the web app that's

304
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,399
the robot generated there's a little bit

305
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,920
of information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom you've been</font>

306
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,290
given a user account<font color="#CCCCCC"> hot club is the</font>

307
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,660
username password and sat Bob your task

308
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:44,219
is to test it so you can call the web up

309
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm able go so that's that one you can</font>

310
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">log in here and do a full test of it</font>

311
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,079
well back a bit at the end and then go

312
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the injections and this is a less</font>

313
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,620
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one that's been injected just</font>

314
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">all getting some of them there's a</font>

315
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,670
cookie that can be reversed that's the

316
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,899
way it's been created<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly frozen</font>

317
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:06,269
zone a volt going a bit simple injection

318
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:10,579
there's a countermeasure is used as a

319
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:13,499
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> forcible admin passwords this is not</font>

320
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:15,599
an easy one but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously in the</font>

321
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:19,079
debt ceiling that I've used so next a

322
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,230
nice and simple we're black we create

323
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,060
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one all vulnerabilities robot</font>

324
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,960
this is my hope random kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in</font>

325
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:34,050
oh yeah you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew it was run the</font>

326
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:36,030
balloon of creating seen one so yeah

327
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:40,199
that's created another one so it's a web

328
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:41,880
file manager in there can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> on as</font>

329
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,130
we see each point if you go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

330
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,660
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> was injected so I it basically</font>

331
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,740
means that student can sit in practice

332
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and practice and practice and practice</font>

333
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,910
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual vulnerable is so</font>

334
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,680
someone wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become an ex gotten</font>

335
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,620
sequel injection<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're nikka just</font>

336
00:13:52,680 --> 00:14:04,920
create site after site with different

337
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:06,720
countermeasures one what's the things we

338
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,729
doing this ten ton of things to do is

339
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,410
immoral think about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are more</font>

340
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,760
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do number one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

345
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,170
downloaded that I could fit in fairly

346
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,380
easily I've medium wall so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> saints</font>

347
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,910
currently very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable more</font>

348
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,340
vulnerabilities we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

349
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,959
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people at security and live</font>

350
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,240
suggested vulnerable is that could be

351
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,800
two ends or I'll put their own web

352
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,840
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> configuration vulnerable is</font>

353
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,839
there's no reason that I can't add in

354
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:43,290
the environment as well I've also got an

355
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,960
honors project<font color="#E5E5E5"> student David who's done</font>

356
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,880
a great job start the year I told him

357
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,790
this is what I'm going to do here's your

358
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,900
possible is he disappeared that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hadn't</font>

359
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,010
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> him for a bit for months and he</font>

came<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barton when he showed me all these</font>

361
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,890
things is implemented so there's lots of

362
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,320
things when they're like passwords

363
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,210
throttling and so many things he's

364
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,970
actually got a training system<font color="#CCCCCC"> in near</font>

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be incorporating the</font>

house stuff into this as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

releasing it swing<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ribbon rather</font>

infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> been testing classes I</font>

370
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,270
give out a network latissimus you all

371
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,790
the same all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about same</font>

372
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,530
network they collaborate so how to make

373
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,870
this more challenging I had the idea

374
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,720
let's try and create a random Network

375
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,440
generator done it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> pyro Cheryl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power</font>

376
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,090
is absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> fabulous you go online</font>

377
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,420
most most of my code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is joining together</font>

378
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,579
routines that I find

379
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,740
light it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really has a copy and paste job</font>

380
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:41,229
I feel like a student<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going online</font>

381
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,130
copy and paste a couple lines in between

382
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,420
it but there are two routines<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

383
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,920
creating a domain controller you know a

384
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,079
simple routine you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should download and</font>

385
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,250
call it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so that's my code I</font>

386
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,290
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that virus but whatever but this</font>

387
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">was invited application a definite</font>

388
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:02,769
vulnerable network for every student

389
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,860
2008 server and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 127 so the general have</font>

390
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:07,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to share rose and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cue clients it's</font>

391
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">multistage partial application but the</font>

392
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,479
batch files in there all we do is really

393
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,430
control thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I mean in a minute the</font>

394
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,260
reason it has to be multi stage is

395
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,689
because you know what windows like you

396
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,230
trying to steal anything properly then

397
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:25,870
you must reboot your machine so it's a

398
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,029
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pain so it's hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be multi</font>

399
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:31,899
stage so a state essentially for the

400
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:36,639
windows 2008<font color="#E5E5E5"> server four stages stage 1</font>

401
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:38,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 stage 1 and this way values</font>

402
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,060
and that's things like tons off the

403
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,849
firewall on UAC just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mixture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

404
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,920
scripts runs run<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay sets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address</font>

405
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,680
and the windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you ever set the</font>

406
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,540
machine name then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be bit you've</font>

407
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,649
got new options so that's stage one and

408
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,930
then reboots and<font color="#CCCCCC"> run stage to set the</font>

409
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,730
opposite to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in control stage three</font>

410
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,279
starts to do a bit more positive things

411
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,230
like adding and users look<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know a lot</font>

412
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">more detail in a minute also as in</font>

413
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,569
computers dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and still somewhere when</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the services as many as i can get away</font>

415
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:14,168
with without asking me to reboot and

416
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:16,660
then install some patches reboots stage

417
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:19,329
for the stalls some more windows

418
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,000
services configures the services<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

419
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,918
also install some third-party software

420
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,829
so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through each</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

421
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,630
part exactly to these parts and any file

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,870
controls also<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've gotten any file with</font>

423
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:36,070
everything in here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the</font>

424
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:38,080
domain name uat<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ad target com also</font>

425
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,879
things like organizing organization

426
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,639
details and they've also good things

427
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,770
like the department's for groups within

428
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,220
the network and things like usernames

429
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,658
that being random were created I know

430
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,190
so once that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use for</font>

431
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:56,190
passwords for creating for users so

432
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,289
adamant random users see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other in</font>

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,960
random users I've got minimum possible

434
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:03,090
paths or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> length of maximum but I've</font>

435
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,090
been a percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users with</font>

436
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,889
dictionary words passports so in here

437
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,049
I've got forty percent that can be

438
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,150
controlled I've also got users with

439
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:14,100
dictionary force numbers so forty

440
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,080
percent the users addiction for numbers

441
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,658
and I've said twenty percent I'm going

442
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have good passwords that are very</font>

00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:25,320
random<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then creates each of the</font>

444
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,500
groups so but human resources legal

445
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,080
finance engineering sales etc and if

446
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,780
there's users who are in the admin group

447
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,789
that I've got good passwords these are

448
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,280
up there admin users were pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

449
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,980
uncrackable passwords and also three

453
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,330
think of their it's 102 102 users have

454
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,730
created and it dumps all this their file

455
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,939
so that i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can take it away when</font>

456
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,650
I'm marking here's a deal in the random

457
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,169
users exceeded anything that's happened

458

462
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,168
a very difficult possible to crack but

463
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:16,320
also we've got an admin with a bad

464
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:18,750
password n here n da lamp<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose password</font>

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,070
as in the dictionary and that one's

466
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,559
there's an admin was a difficult

467
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,168
passport so it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of goes through</font>

468
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">that hchildress through that and also i</font>

469
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:30,750
got pageant patches up to a random day

470
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:33,809
or specified date so i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> patch the</font>

472
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:38,039
it randomly and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did this was i</font>

473
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,590
used the third part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> packaging that</font>

474
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:43,379
they knows all these patches as msu

475
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,959
files and it's very nice that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

476
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,480
can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nore stopped because again</font>

477
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,309
windows when you do in a patch what

478
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,530
should we start with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the very</font>

479
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:58,200
last one restarts<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay also installs</font>

480
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,639
when the services using powershell and

483
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,600
so you see the kind of thing Sutton's

install and dhcp tftp smtp just<font color="#E5E5E5"> however</font>

485
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,219
many services i can do end there at the

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,500
end of all this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sample</font>

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,910
to please snap short system so you

518
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:39,690
snapshot the system and by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

519
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,340
services registry files the kind of

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> a snapshot or not then you</font>

521
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,959
install what you want and it may be

522
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,000
apache web server with a website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

523
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,090
the configuration in there and then you

524
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,130
post snapshot it and it creates an msf

525
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,770
file of everything that you've done that

526
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,260
changed so i can set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> say apache</font>

527
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,540
server in 20 different vulnerable ways

528
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,460
with a different msi file for each of

529
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,350
them and then see it at random<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose</font>

530
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,450
that one or choose that one or choose

531
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,550
that one so so brilliant a lot of

532
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,900
application it's about 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old i've</font>

534
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,390
but it's a little bit slow but hey once

535
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,480
it's created is created

536
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,620
yes and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine is really to create</font>

537
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,870
different categories in there so every

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">anti procedure on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

542
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:35,139
complicated a little bit complicated i'm

545
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,260
once you crack for syntax then it's

546
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,690
answer and creatively easy to use it

547
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,790
allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a vm revert to</font>

00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:03,110
controller<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's essentially</font>

575
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:04,669
what it does is certain way and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

576
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">first controller will go through my four</font>

577
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:10,160
stages of creating that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and for</font>

578
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,270
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the users with all the services etc</font>

579
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,250
etc once it's finished at the very end

580
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">okapis required files to the secondary</font>

controller and each of the clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

582
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,780
then the cause we've got fixed IP

583
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,440
addresses we can pierce exec enter them

584
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,280
and say no<font color="#CCCCCC"> checking action and</font>

585
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,340
essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

586
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:34,580
is the secondary controller will be set

up sets opposite<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in control none</font>

to so reasonably complicated procedure

592
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,100
but you know it will straightforward

593
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,720
paint on a future work in this again

an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've got that I think it</font>

596
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,290
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice if we could see every five</font>

minutes get the user to do something or

604
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,560
there more windows services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

of them to do and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course then you</font>

609
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,370
start thinking well i can add in virtual

610
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,630
rules as well so we're going to we're

611
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,489
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> add in look the whole wall I don't</font>

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,430
got a linux server organ are there no

614
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,890
one except so obvious thing that all

615
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,290
certainly possible the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

616
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:45,140
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a while but lots and</font>

617
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:47,600
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things ender combining the two</font>

618
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:50,210
of them this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> canet an idea what HUD</font>

619
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,870
I've got a module done in fort here

620
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:55,910
called been tested where the students in

621
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,439
traditionally have been given some kind

622
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of target that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> op</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack and</font>

623
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:05,660
again we've all<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the same target so</font>

624
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:07,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">had the idea what combine all this but</font>

625
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,400
not creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> four different virtual</font>

626
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,680
machines pre create everything in there

627
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,980
so all the usernames all the services

628
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,050
everything required for each student so

629
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,730
student one will have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

630
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,490
student to go of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up students</font>

631
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,540
will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these and the way I'm</font>

632
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,660
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment you built up the</font>

633
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,850
first vm which has a web server you

634
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,940
choose your name from their head submit

635
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,439
and it's set up the environment for you

636
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the veggie way so it means that</font>

637
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,640
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> student has got a different</font>

638
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:40,880
web application they've got different

639
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,289
usernames and passwords and services at

640
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,110
students are working on this current

641
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:48,210
like some of you in front of me I'm

642
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:51,539
working on a common one it'll be really

643
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,070
interesting to see the feedback that

644
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,530
will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this so I can kind of</font>

645
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,750
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again more and more father</font>

646
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,039
work involved in here I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

647
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could of the same set of the M</font>

648
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,020
so you built before the MS<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's em</font>

649
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,440
office to swag you can see I want to

650
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a network with two hundred users</font>

651
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,669
ten percent as more crap parcels native

652
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the good passwords I want</font>

653
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:16,380
numerous services and then heck<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

654
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,360
it's very very similar front end and it

655
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,850
will go away and generate it and then

656
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,860
the kind of injected that the volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

657
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,899
office the solutions are there as well

658
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,709
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> students if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to practice</font>

659
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:31,049
there you go you know help yourself I

660
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,390
like the instant feedback of that I

661
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:37,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">think is is the real good 11-point</font>

662
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:39,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">honest so something up certainly find of</font>

663
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,950
useful utilities I will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> releasing</font>

664
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,480
them as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as i get time to get my</font>

665
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,770
arse in gear and do it properly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

666
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,200
said we want to add in the honest

667
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:52,049
projects stuff in prove there's a lot a

668
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,679
bit stuff in there but future what goal

669
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:57,480
or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know any of you are partly</font>

670
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,659
students in<font color="#CCCCCC"> subject or norse projects</font>

671
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,820
core in this anyway thank you

672
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,549
for what was then a rattle sit very

673
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">quick all over Martin's instructions</font>

674
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:08,629
that we all need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pub</font>

675
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:20,440
[Applause]

676
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:31,230
that's got a 25 minute for questions

677
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:31,230
will help you beverly hospital seen it

678
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:45,370
yes yes a whole you know that's again

679
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,890
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what there could possibly</font>

680
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,270
be done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am thinking again that</font>

681
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">would make a great on this project for</font>

682
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:57,520
somebody doing that you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

683
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:59,410
big issues would stop this<font color="#E5E5E5"> about one of</font>

684
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,940
the big issues i know someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else at</font>

685
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,020
another university who's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

686
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,460
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing and they are</font>

687
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,679
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set this fantastic framework</font>

688
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,270
saying as i haven't seen any out group

689
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,799
from that it doesn't watch it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

690
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's two years down the line there's</font>

691
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:16,629
nothing there so my idea was definitely

692
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,710
a let's make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it work number one and then</font>

693
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,809
let's get clever with that number two so

694
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:27,309
yeah I totally agree can't be done it

695
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:29,020
would be excellent anyone wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do an</font>

696
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:33,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">honest project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be delighted if you</font>

697
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:36,160
did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah just a quick quick</font>

698
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:38,439
little look at this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

699
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,330
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spring running to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> begin</font>

700
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">mer it's all running a single virtual</font>

701
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:45,639
machine i'll just briefly show you this

702
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:47,710
is the syntax in here for the vm run

703
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,799
command<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it's awkwar-- awkward-- if</font>

704
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:53,559
your vm run without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the snapshot vm run</font>

705
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,690
start an evil shared folders and you see

706
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,270
underneath forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd share folder set</font>

707
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:01,630
share folder state etc then underneath

708
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:06,720
that is basically like a copy of an oval

709
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:10,140
one so sent does it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> but awkward but</font>

710
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,140
keep going through

711
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,520
from there is visit we just kind of

712
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,080
create network the whole phone takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

713
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit 45 minutes to run so I certainly</font>
