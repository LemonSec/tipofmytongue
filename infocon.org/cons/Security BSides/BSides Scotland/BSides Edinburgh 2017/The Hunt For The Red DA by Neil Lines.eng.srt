52
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:25,390
it's quite an interesting area bit of a

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,940
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the power went out what</font>

54
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,619
happened and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this suit from the media</font>

55
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,209
and it was last Sunday and it just

56
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,620
caught my eye basically saying that

57
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,629
hackers potentially tried to bypass a

58
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,079
nuclear<font color="#E5E5E5"> power station defenses last week</font>

59
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:43,440
and it was called and stopped this is

60
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:46,870
another interesting thing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> media</font>

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,670
apparently to have 7700 present active

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,040
professional hackers working for him

63
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,899
which I think that odd statistic I don't

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,519
know if it's true or not that the vision

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,140
of people have enough career is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

66
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,810
quite limited and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have much</font>

67
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,339
yeah they do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad things but</font>

68
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,540
theoretically they've got seven thousand

69
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:07,329
seven hundred people now doing it

70
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:08,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">full-time this concept we are at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> war we</font>

71
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,720
are being attacked all the time and

72
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,430
we're also attacking other people all

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,709
the time back and forwards back and

74
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,379
forward it something that's overlooked

75
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,709
because there's never been an official

76
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:22,989
you know we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just act but we are</font>

77
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,840
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an interesting statement that i</font>

78
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,970
read to date there<font color="#E5E5E5"> has not been a single</font>

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,079
cyber crime that's regarded bad enough

80
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,329
to be an act of war yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so think</font>

81
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,069
nation-state cyber attacks are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fetes</font>

82
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:38,470
what do you think ARF right<font color="#E5E5E5"> outfit on</font>

83
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,319
again and nation-state anyone what do

84
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person comes to your head</font>

85
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I was that thank you very very good</font>

86
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">one and i'll get back to a bit anything</font>

87
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,660
else there's think more<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what</font>

88
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,379
do you think the nation-state costly

89
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,239
expensive you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really advanced</font>

90
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,040
incredible entre not to swear

91
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">sophisticated exactly why i said i'll</font>

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,379
come back to that that ticks all those

93
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,489
boxes it's expensive it's sophisticated

94
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:12,250
who's my slide saying that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have my</font>

95
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,870
suspicions this isn't official that I

96
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,779
have my suspicions that they're not

97
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,789
sophisticated as you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

98
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reality is that they could be done</font>

99
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:24,430
by a non nation-state it can be done by

100
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,550
an individual right let's look at an

101
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,110
example of what was regarded as a no

102
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,150
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what about show</font>

103
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,289
is regarded as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nation state attack was</font>

104
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,900
because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected back to North</font>

105
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:35,909
Korea now it was never proven and you're

106
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,289
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> all read information on it and</font>

107
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">let me go that far into it and you</font>

108
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:41,550
probably watched documentaries is that

109
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,810
this one here in Vice did anyone watch

110
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,400
it it was very very good soluble on

111
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">viruses brilliant there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about 25</font>

112

minutes long<font color="#E5E5E5"> the straight to the point</font>

113
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,840
and a front of lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security experts</font>

114
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,090
saying things like we're at war and i

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,179
find it<font color="#CCCCCC"> amusing I'm quite interested in</font>

116
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,318
media and those words around things

117
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,030
they're really excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it they're</font>

118
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,159
really selling that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sexy sell but</font>

119
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,590
the reality is well<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

120
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:07,889
happened right so guardians of peace I

121
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,239
see my notes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> November the 24th 2014 a</font>

122
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,310
hacker group identified themselves as

123
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,699
guardians of the peace are broke into

124
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,400
hacked so late media now to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

125
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:19,259
what was taken personal information

126
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,719
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony employees emails between</font>

127
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,719
employees embarrassing stuff very

128
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:26,639
embarrassing you released emails salary

129
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,960
information and unreleased<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sony films</font>

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,219
which is obviously connected to finance

131
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,590
there's money involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that their</font>

132
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:34,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">dimension massive lots over those films</font>

133
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,638
being released right what do the

134
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,990
guardians of peace though now this is

135
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,300
what interests me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is my tools</font>

136
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,789
gonna start changing a little bit they

137
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,650
got remote access internal network they

138
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:46,310
exploited internal misconfigurations

139
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,568
they hunted out users of interest and

140
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">exploited domain admin at that point I</font>

141
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:53,960
lit up I thought what they did what they

142
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:57,840
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main event and they stole data</font>

143
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,310
there's my things of interest it started

144
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,739
me thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the difference</font>

145
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,120
between what they've done is hot

146

another document embedded in it I

wouldn't click on it but from tests that

00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,719
we do work and I've done myself and

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> their freeways which the third way</font>

260
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:45,529

261
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:47,690
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find what I find is a lot of</font>

262
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:49,040
places after you get hash value reverse

263
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,470
the hash I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> about emissions is now</font>

264
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,560
so we'll do a talk and they still have

265
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,720
ssl vpns on the outside or citrix boxes

266
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,290
with single factor authentication so

267
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,660
just getting creds can give you a pivot

268
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,959
into the network I do it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time so</font>

269
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:09,230
it's carried a macro is probably

270
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:11,000
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and that without</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">credentials it's not that useful which</font>

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,290
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back into later right you and</font>

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,480
see it interests me these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> never very</font>

274
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:20,089
quick demo of it so there's a cloned web

275
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,370
site of the famous dating website now

276
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:27,350
just from viewing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sites a refreshing</font>

277
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:28,670
the browser right just from refreshing

278
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,110
the browsers and not putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

279
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,339
credentials in whatsoever would get

280
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,199
impressed so we get a hash just

281
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,689
doing it now what I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in this</font>

282
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:39,479
video is I look at the source code and

283
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:41,550
if you zoom in right above them there's

284
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,110
a request now I'm going to zoom in on

285
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:50,370
that because you not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that</font>

286
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:51,839

open on your firewall and you're using

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,189
Internet Explorer that's going to happen

295
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:10,550
it does happen a lot on tests right so

296
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:14,309
quickly talking about you and say

297
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:16,170
cracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> hashes now I'm not going to</font>

298
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:18,300
sell this it's free anyway but I'm not

299
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,469
here to promote this today that<font color="#CCCCCC"> released</font>

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,600
combinations cracking hashes isn't

303
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,910
really a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people will</font>

304
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,470
say oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rells and I do usuals</font>

305
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,569
these rules with it but I would try the

306
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,670
dictionary first and then old news rules

307
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,990
is required rules don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> add football</font>

308
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,059
teams that don't have town so then add

309
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,740
CT names that don't add the top thousand

310
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,370
male and female names to it they are

311
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">also incredibly slow now I heard people</font>

312
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,939
say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really care about being slow</font>

313
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,610
because I've got releasing at home well

314

<font color="#E5E5E5">personally I haven't got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten grand we</font>

319
00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:00,209
here now lenovo laptop and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

320
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,679
have corporate laptops they're hideous

321
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:04,679
what would happen and this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

322
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">have right final point before I talk</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about the internal side to it insane</font>

324
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,300
products you've all got any way that

325
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:10,740
we've now got from the outside to the

326
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,279
inside at this point when we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

327
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,889
creds with the hashes and you could do

328
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,059
it ugly as hell this is and anybody on

329
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,129
that show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more pretty-looking</font>

330
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,019
email but the reality is you can add

331
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:24,209
microcode an hour late and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again see all</font>

332
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:27,209
into the same word document so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

333
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,979
really really weaponize these things now

334
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:30,929
that's a more prettily document as a

335
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,759
sort one that will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used on engagement</font>

336
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:34,079
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why i say i use this on</font>

337
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,579
engagements is because i know this has

338
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,160
been used in the wild this is the sort

339
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing the media has</font>

340
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,819
on their blog so that this is what

341
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,980
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on what we've received so it's just ways</font>

343
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,870
of enticing people to hit macro this is

344
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:50,360
a good example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of la la and it's a</font>

345
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,860
recruitment word document so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

346
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,629
put an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> open the document for more</font>

347
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,819
information and just right they'll

348
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:57,410
speech there about how underneath these

349
00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:00,229
are all the individual jobs and each one

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one going along this is good it's</font>

353
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:10,160
good we'll go through quick and make you

354
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:13,339
quite short right so we've gone from the

355
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,750
outside and on the inside now this is

356
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:17,779
gonna be a bit painful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell</font>

357
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,970
people here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I recently discovered a</font>

358
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,040
love the PowerShell I'm quite slow and

359
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,319
i'm quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> set in my ways I've been using</font>

still worked that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm starting to change</font>

364
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,620
it now more to powershell uses less of

365
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:36,230
metasploit the one that show you now is

366
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,769
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit and process that i have</font>

367
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,839
done flight last two or three years so

368
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:45,470
we've got crazy and we've got a remote

369
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,089
shell on some internal box now let's get

370
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,339
those pretend here here's the shell and

371
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,290
what would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do once you've got access</font>

372
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:52,279
to a shell where the first thing you

373
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,069
want to start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">configurations for this I think they're</font>

375
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:59,899
typically would use SMD<font color="#CCCCCC"> login with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,000

apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> offensive a basic flavor</font>

378

warfare that we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the whole process</font>

379
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,689
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> add the user name that we got to</font>

380
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,689
add the password

381
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,959
and at the subnet I'm always interested

382
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,410
in pomo jewel scripts that allow you to

383
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">set the our hosts I like the idea of</font>

similar ization the fatty you can just

385
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,910
spray it out against an interface subnet

386
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,379
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't asked very very interesting</font>

387
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,519
right I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> run now what we're looking</font>

388
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,439
for we're looking for any user with

389
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,799
local administrative access local

390
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:40,358
administrative access is gold bust and

391
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,309
allows you to use basic set against box

392
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:43,989
it also means it got a good chance

393
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:48,069
against system when you're on pace<font color="#E5E5E5"> exec</font>

394
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:50,290
on that box and ecosystem health of this

395
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:52,169
happen well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get creds and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won it</font>

396
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,549
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside to the internal side</font>

397
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:56,859
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> common it's common that you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

398
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:58,839
is spray / / 24 it's commonly you'll

399
00:15:56,859 --> 00:16:00,129
find one or two boxes where that user

400
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:02,829
has been given the local admin rights

401
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:04,329
why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they think even local admin</font>

402
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:07,299
rights on that box there's lots of

403
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:09,638
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just miss configuration for</font>

404
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,108
one and the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe they have</font>

405
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,790
rights to install something on that box

406
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:15,699
or later they were developer and they

407
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:19,480
need it for a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

408
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:21,279
incredibly common on finding right so

409
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,410
once you access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it you can use person</font>

410
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,239
correct and I'm gonna talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

411
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,410
basically executive Chris exactly is a

412
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:28,600
lot of you here will know<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

413
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,040
slide and that power<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't know how to</font>

414
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pit except</font>

415
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,540
this exact also quickly it's like Talia

416
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,649
gives you access to the machine now the

417
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,969
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want access that machines</font>

418
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:38,350
because that uses that crowed you've got

419
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,149
has got<font color="#E5E5E5"> local admin rights on that</font>

420
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,220
machine so that's why those of instant

421
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:45,100
interest to you now this video here very

422
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,199
quickly let me show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> snowfox for an</font>

427
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:08,379
two years ago changed it from using

428
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:11,319
dropping a shell to the box to

429
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,329
powershell which is fantastic because it

430
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:17,250
automated bypasses antivirus before this

431
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:19,779
is to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> so called feel ya feel or</font>

432
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,519
shelter to make a payload that would

433
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,380
slip past antivirus but now it just

434
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,970
automatically slips past<font color="#E5E5E5"> antivirus which</font>

435
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,970
is which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> overpressure</font>

436
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,330
this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting up notes when</font>

437
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,360
it's lost its power shell when you run

438
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,830
it I'd say twenty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time</font>

439
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,260
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a session back immediately</font>

440
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,178
now what found is if it like some green

441
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,190
like a Christmas clothes off so just run

442
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,750
it again and what you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> is down the</font>

443
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,899
second attempt you will get a shell or

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,700
sitting on the access right gate system

445
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:52,739
is not an exploit is an attempt to

446
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,990
personate a security context<font color="#E5E5E5"> or system</font>

447
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,100
right to this work you get system I have

448
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,720
to remind myself of that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

449
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,080
quite capable of saying it is an exploit

450
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,700
and course it's not but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens</font>

451
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,939
when you run get system and it doesn't

452
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,690
work now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bit when i start to get</font>

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,870
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not now it's probably more</font>

456
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,000
interesting but it's not easy so when it

457
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,070
doesn't work professor professor<font color="#CCCCCC"> prove</font>

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,309
esque as people keep telling me and i'm

459
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:28,200
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot stronger at these are</font>

463
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,840
control and will stop you from getting

464
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,700
system and it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good i recommend</font>

465
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,230
to people they turn it on is that no

466
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,210
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pops up and says are you</font>

467
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,559
sure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do this i would</font>

468
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend having it because it's one of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that stops us from getting</font>

471
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,049
another good way now i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

472
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,449
about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> powershell sort of a trick in</font>

473
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,610
a bit later and not at the moment right

474
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,140
so pretending one of those are just

475
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:05,219
worth of my free videos for everything

476
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,570
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how cash is now writes a quick</font>

from the outside to the inside we've

479
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,908
exploited internal miss configuration

sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the domain admin the DA okay</font>

485
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,459
what is a DI basically if the keys to

486

the castle is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high schoolish level of</font>

a single domain is access to fall domain

488
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,199

access to a defendant<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain</font>

490
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,110
right the first thing you want to do

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,720
when you're hunting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at domain admin is</font>

to use it uninstall it must

494
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,140
personal opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> start to listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

495
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:50,929
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> no your tools I call this the</font>

496
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:54,860
clones it's incorrect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some hash is</font>

497
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:56,990
the actual official term now why does

498
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft not sold passwords I'll get to</font>

499
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason why pastor hashing words is</font>

500
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,930
because they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> salt password so if</font>

501
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,389
you have a password hash from one box at

502
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:07,130
the local administrative hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

503
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,410
they've cloned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> logs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over</font>

504
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,730
and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again that same password hash</font>

505
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,740
is going to be on all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other boxes</font>

506
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,440
now the reason why they don't salt has

507
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,040
hashes is because backward compatibility

508
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,150
they just can't do it would break it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

509
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,830
that is why still today they're not

510
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it they're fully capable of doing</font>

511
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,600
it they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't for compatibility</font>

512
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:29,530
reasons so Microsoft engineer comes

513
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,300
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> built along she really liked it</font>

514
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:34,129
clones that machine over and over and

515
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,290
over again and then on the final day

516
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,520
he's off sick and someone else comes

517
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,260
down doesn't know he cloned actually

518
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,540
build his own machine so what happens is

519
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,129
we come along with hashes and we can

520
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,120
access that machine that machine that

521
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,350
machine that machine not that one

522
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,060
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was off that day that we can</font>

523
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,820
access that machine with that same<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash</font>

524
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:53,240
and people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep saying as the hash</font>

525
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,740
is dead it's not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> key scene on test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

526
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">just keeps coming up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and up it to</font>

527
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,650
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I would believe if any</font>

528
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,690
nation state was going to do it they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

529
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,660
just use this it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and why</font>

530
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,070
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you not do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that works</font>

531
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,510
yes it's noisy some of you might be

532
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,490
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is nauseated not it is</font>

533
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,230
noisy and I find a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

534
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,940
log problem or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a scene</font>

535
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,190
that have no way of having alerted

536
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,200
messages so a lot of tackers know this

537
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,270
if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to attack someone who</font>

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">example what's the likelihood that</font>

540
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,890
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think a nation states</font>

541
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,000
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack them and secondly what's</font>

542
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,590
the likelihood because they're not down

543
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">at Alicia I compliance they don't have</font>

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,000
that they going to have logging<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

cross then also criminals<font color="#CCCCCC"> are starting</font>

548
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,960
to catch up worth noting 2016 has been

549
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,370
reports a lot of a ransomware<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

550

somewhere and somewhere and it affect a

single box well noticed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> geez pass the</font>

552
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,169

555
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:48,419

00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:52,889
your boxes which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really scary</font>

557
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:55,750
also pen testers use it all time right

558
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:59,380
this is fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool that idea squat</font>

spray out those hashes against the

entire network your subnets that you

569
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,820
have defined and it will log into all

570
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,100
those machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the hash that we've</font>

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,689
given it where it can log into and it

572
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,120
will run a command looking for domain

573
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,010
admins officers what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and then it</font>

574
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,419
will give you back mr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of all the</font>

IP addresses where the domain admins are

00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,890
and their name now if it can do that

577
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,410
basic set can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that box so</font>

578
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,090
after running it i siad means everywhere

579
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:44,620
domaine happens everywhere and it's

580
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:46,929
quite scary and every test after test I

581
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,449
do from the outside getting to the

582
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,760
inside and you just think why are you

583
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">all logged in as the main admin it can</font>

586
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,919
it's just like there seems to be this

587
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,900
broken idea that if you're an

588

administrator on an either a Windows

589
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:09,580
domain you have to have two main admin

590
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:11,320
rights to administer it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't so</font>

595
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,379
resets installing software this is all

596
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,300
all incorrect your goose delegation of

597
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,770
permissions<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> output a delegation</font>

of rights and always get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wrong and</font>

599
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,850
then Microsoft delegation of permissions

600
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,470
and you can say that that admin has

601
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,120
rights to install this software that

602
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,350
admin has was to change passwords that I

603
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,939
mean can change passwords and install

604
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,350
software tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the main admin</font>

606
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,820
with that that's the key sucursal domain

607
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,260
admin and I ask someone a lot smarter

608

<font color="#E5E5E5">than me about this and said went with</font>

the heb use he said simple when you set

nothing sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll fill up and preachy</font>

613
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:56,290
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> found two main admin how to</font>

614
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:58,000
exploit it so you've used SMB exec

615
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:00,090
you've spotted where they all hidden you

616
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,590
use purse except to those boxes

617
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,658
and you've got remote access to those

618
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,000
boxes and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this</font>

00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,820
incredible tool many cats northagen know

they go voted to Main Avenue at the

actually all allow you to have back as

707
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,890
the dns server now some also said i know

708
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,170
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> true the DC theoretically has to</font>

709
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:36,200
be in doing this box but thank you your

710
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:37,490
usual agree they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> suit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be so</font>

711
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,520
this is why when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not click</font>

712
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:43,910
configure it's a very lightly bite your

713
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:48,620
dns box<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will be DC and often you'll</font>

714
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:50,000
see two now at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rdp to</font>

715
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,939
it because you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the Khmer napping</font>

716
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,450
happy no credit you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> add a patriot or</font>

717
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,130
totally you can pierce executive it

718
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,690
Pierce exacting gate is fantastic now

719
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,730
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bit that I absolutely</font>

720
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,820
deserve this thing gets me of the time

721
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,320
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a hash dump our would pause</font>

722
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,700
this but I'll doing and also explain it

723
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,260
the crunchy pause it was in this mode

724
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,580
but if I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to jump now I</font>

725
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:17,960
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like the frequent showing</font>

726
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:21,080
is dropping you've got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jam top here</font>

727
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,740
we go Thank goes on and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on and on</font>

728
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,800
now some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those smart might be able to</font>

729
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,080
spot that they've actually

730
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,760
that's because this is a large box in my

731
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,860
house<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to show you any</font>

732
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,060
client stuff there but it's also

733
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,770
interesting because i had the same

734
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">password for every user and if you</font>

735
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,920
looked at the hashes in a minute minutes

736
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,060
tops they're all the same there's again

737
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:46,210
I'll read for smoke shop doesn't sell

738
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:47,409
passwords now an interesting comment so

739
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,050
that is why it's still talking into

740
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,570
intravenous<font color="#CCCCCC"> an attacker wouldn't do this</font>

741
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:54,220
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it don't care but I always</font>

742
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask a client at this point you have</font>

743
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,610
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC's I can see to hear that you</font>

744

745
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,790
particularly preference that I do this

746
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">one out so they'll replicates it's the</font>

747
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,610
same day two on each one the reason why

748
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,010
i asked them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is because in my</font>

749
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,889
experience of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this twice this has</font>

750
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:11,530
made a DC bounce just from running have

751
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,060
stopped so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was pre-award that it is</font>

752
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">low risk but there is a potential risk</font>

753
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,310
mostly it's always worth noting is

754
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:20,440
people right so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the hashes</font>

755
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:23,080
you can craft all those with your chosen

756
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,820
dictionary are you fantastic what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

757
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,639
then do looking at share folders is

758
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:29,230
always a good point now if you can find

759
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,360
an organization chart quite often put on

760
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,210
their websites or somewhere you can find

761
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,800
it generally in a share folder you can

762
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,210
access to everything at this point yes

763
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,889
the main act domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> admin gives you</font>

764
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's not going</font>

765
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to target individual people we've got</font>

766
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,680
the hashes and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lancaster</font>

767
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,689
house and all you can crack it so you

768
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,550
can start taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to co you can start</font>

769
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,630
targeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know human resources is</font>

770
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,820
always great one reading the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth</font>

771
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:54,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">emails there you're going to find a few</font>

772
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,429
documents that's exactly what guardians

773
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,500
of peace wanted to do with silent<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

774
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,300
so on average this is what I found to

775
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,180
get from nothing from sending an email

776
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,879
in it takes between 30 to 4 30 minutes

777
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:10,150
24 hours so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite I think white</font>

778
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,490
relatively short amount of time that's

779
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,200
why I did that as a start why does it

780
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,410
take something<font color="#E5E5E5"> mocked a bit the phytate</font>

781
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:21,430
takes 12 hours and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take 12</font>

782
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:25,300
hours personally right that was the old

783
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:27,100
process and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had rewritten this I</font>

784
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,470
start this talk writing about six months

785
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,850
ago if I know what I know today I would

786
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,290
have written it very differently there's

787
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,010
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot quicker ways I knew this</font>

788
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:39,500

792
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,510
they can by default they can now if a

standard users to mount the domain

794
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,770
mounted share on the DC if you couldn't

795
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,260
afraid there that's the locations and

domain admin in those documents

803
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,610
alternatively it's a local admin even so

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's of high level value can attacker</font>

at some point they released this week

808
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,940
I'm not sure if you can see there that's

837
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,090
of it prevents new credentials for being

placed in the group's policy preference

839
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,179
so you group sex and our files if you

840

run that update you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> no longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

841
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,450
that it doesn't let you but what it

842
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,070
doesn't do this is the catcher it

843
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,300
doesn't go back and delete them because

844
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,700
if you believe them services and stopped

845
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,500
working so a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will run this</font>

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,790
you can be sitting outside and it can be

988
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:51,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the water network and you'll</font>

989
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,140
see corporate users actually connected

990
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,870
to the guest network all the time now

991
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,910
why do they do that well if you ever

992
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,170
turn up to site on your Thursday<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,509
sometimes she has had direct internet

00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,890
access outs and people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the</font>

1000
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:14,660
it sees it now people<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but they don't</font>

1001
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,129
broadcast profile was the problem well

1002
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,350
I'll started researching it and i was

1003
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:20,360
looking at this these pub pollack group

1004
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,980
24d bi directional antennas they've

1005
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,890
actually said and quit and you can plug

1006
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,990
in straight into what is alpha tardes

1007
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:28,970
these are pretty scary stuff about to

1008
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:34,700
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the amount of distance this</font>

1009
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:36,470
thing can see an SSID from now instantly

1010
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,060
it's worth and it was a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a laugh</font>

1011
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:41,120
off it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i looked at my wall but</font>

1012
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,799
that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> scary and that instantly</font>

1013
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,420
anyone who does was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the term ago was</font>

1014
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,760
rubbish because you can't broadcast back

1015
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,320
now you're right you can see it that

1016
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,420
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have the power probably too</font>

1017
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,590

1018
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,960
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just be</font>

1019
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,520
sitting moles<font color="#E5E5E5"> late and start doing a bit</font>

1020

corporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> users on it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if it's</font>

1023
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:04,490
worth doing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and what would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1024
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:07,040
realistic would be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these which I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pringle can things now you big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nut it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes down the road especially London</font>

1029
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:16,220
to be realistic and an eclectic any

1030
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,080
plugs into an alpha card so corporate

1031
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,240
users run the guest Wi-Fi what I would

1032
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,610
do and what I have done to prove this

1033
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,770
actually does work is connect to the

1034
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,840
guest wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> foret responder which is</font>
