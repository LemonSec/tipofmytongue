there's loads of good security research

70
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,980
to be done by hopefully some of you

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,780
you got your router off your ISP

83
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,970
sometimes it come with a cd-rom with the

84
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,470
broadband setup software and you put

85
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,239
that into your computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd run it</font>

this goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while by the way this</font>

is remember doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in late two</font>

download it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even go</font>

94
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,339
absolutely bloody mad because it's one

95
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,620
of those boring specifications you'll

96
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,000
ever read through basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it allows</font>

it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than that it involves</font>

105
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,190
so the horribleness that involves done

it involves<font color="#E5E5E5"> jabber for some reason when</font>

107
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,070
i was reading through it was like

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,210
there's a bunch of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,640
XMPP being used for something I mean

110
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,580
this loads of potential crap there and

111
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,740
it's all xml-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's disgusting you</font>

112
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,120
could read it it's on amendment<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 is</font>

113
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,220
probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more amendments of</font>

of on your CP on your router from the

117
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,240
landslide in theory you can manage stuff

118
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,240
like wireless keys you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> set the dns</font>

119
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers you can set the entity servers</font>

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set whatever you want it's got</font>

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,960
full read rice so you know they see SDNS

122
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,270
wireless security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it comes a few</font>

123
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">security requirements so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

124
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,260
how you manage and set up your<font color="#E5E5E5"> router</font>

125
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,860
you can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the settings you can</font>

126
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:34,820
fiddle with<font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff yeah it's got</font>

127
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,380
security things so apparently any action

128
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that allows configuration changes to the</font>

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,510
any password protected action must

131
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,610
require HTTP digest off blah blah blah

132
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,740
not library pass routes you know it

133
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,180
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty solid and this interface</font>

134
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,990
should only be accessible from the

135
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,880
landslide so maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in theory</font>

136
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,230
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all nice and lovely but in</font>

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,230
nobody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bothered preposterous new</font>

140

things password seems be entirely

00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,520
optional actual credentials yeah you can

142
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,440
totally read them they're not actually

143
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,840
obfuscated if they don't return some

144

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet oh yes this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> core problem</font>

147
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">here this thing which was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only supposed</font>

148
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,240
to be ever landslide and explicitly say

149
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,220
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much do not put this on</font>

150
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,050
the internet was putting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet at</font>

151
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,970
scale by everyone oh and it also has the

152
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,620
implementation sucks so you've got bonus

153
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,360
trivial to my injection vulnerabilities

154
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,470
because why not you know you might as

155
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,210
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the entire row of top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

clear tax credits like vulnerability

158
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:59,780
bingo so you know you get old boxes so

159
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:03,660
obvious outcome of this disaster well

160
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:06,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">Deutsche Telekom had some problems they</font>

161
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,330
had some quite serious problems and they

162
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,610
were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of there when this whole</font>

163
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,859
incident kicked off but i'm sure most do

164
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,590
you remember is incident because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

165
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,180
recent um when this all kicked off their

166
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,750
kind of the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a serious</font>

167
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:25,530
outage but they weren't alone talk talk

168
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:28,710
they suffered you know mass scale

169
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:31,409
outages routers stopping working device

170
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,020
being bricked kind of bricked you know

171
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:37,950
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work anymore um</font>

172
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:43,590

and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably suffered some issues</font>

175
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,799
because this and it all happened all at

176
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,450
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this was home user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> siddeley</font>

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,640
going oh no my internet doesn't work

178
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,610
what's going on because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software</font>

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,490
vulnerabilities being exploited scale so

180
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,750
you know what happened who did it you

181
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,220
know is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> an attribution parody</font>

182
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,550
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on can we all point fingers and</font>

183
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,740
blame somebody well actually we can so

184
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:15,090
it was great pities you probably can't

185
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:17,479
read the screenshots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python code</font>

186
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,070
there that was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python code used to</font>

187
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,099
do some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone on a</font>

188
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:28,860
script kiddies forum and what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

189
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:31,680
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends a set ntp server request which</font>

190
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,140
tells the routers update<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ntp server</font>

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,909
which contains these magical back ticks

192
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,559
and you put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> commands into the mac</font>

193
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">ticks and suddenly they get executed on</font>

194
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">the box and everyone has a nice day so</font>

195
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,600
what they were doing was they were

196
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,370
downloading and executing a boss to do

197
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,460
DDoS attacks and stuff and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

200
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,310
the idea was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a giant DDoS</font>

partner and they

202
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:03,180
no pocket things do skiddy things what

203
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,939
caused the bricking though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should go</font>

204
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,310
back what<font color="#E5E5E5"> caused</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bricking is when you</font>

205
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,950
exploit this issue if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

206
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:15,479
you update the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTP server a bit with a</font>

207
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:17,480
shell command what happens is the device

208
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,610
no longer knows what time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is and</font>

209
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,990
computers you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know things</font>

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,240
about computers you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer is</font>

211
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,980
really like know what time it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">few they can't figure out what time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

213
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,940
is anymore suddenly they go haywire and

214
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,980
just ship breaks and they start working

215
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,080
and certainly no more computer for you

216
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,430
the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to malfunction</font>

217
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,940
you could start to reset them and they

218
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,400
might start working again maybe so you

219
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">know this wasn't the first time that the</font>

220
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,720
particular piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> software involved</font>

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,610
had issues for<font color="#E5E5E5"> tier of sale there was</font>

all sorts of shenanigans the most

229
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,020
important one was you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> access advice</font>

230
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,270
that any authentication because you

231
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,430
could do basically right what where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

232
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,660
can overwrite variables in memory with

other things you could say<font color="#CCCCCC"> / write the</font>

234
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,079
check for admin password variable with

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,850
halal know who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the admin</font>

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">password or you could change access</font>

237
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,050
controls and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> really trivially</font>

238
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,310
exploited vulnerabilities this the too

239
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,290
long don't read a bit below<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the proof</font>

240
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,719
of concept from a very intelligent chap

241
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,630
by the name of kenzo that exploits an

242
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,810
aircon one what it is is there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> major</font>

243
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,030
on this fossil<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the first you've got</font>

244
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,640
key values right in cookies see if key

245
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:47,280
value so the first one is the key to

246
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
some it's you know pointer to something

247
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,089
and second is what we're covering it

248
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,580
with and the same point you know

249
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:55,560
addressed over rice crapped over writer

250
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,800
with and what that does what this

251
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,839
particular one does it says basically

252
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,550
let people in without a password you

253
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,050
know don't check you know if the common

254
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,030
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> right port let them reconfigure</font>

255
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,870
the device remotely it'll be fine you

256
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,490
send this request the router suddenly

257
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,339
the state of the router changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bhoomi</font>

258
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,890
ring he was the software is a crock of

259
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:18,190
rubbish<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know just crap software it's</font>

260
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:20,500
really poorly written and you know that

261
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">was you know that was one of the first</font>

262
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,430
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people straight going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

263
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,470
we should look at heroes of mine and you

264
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,199
know what is it anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

265
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,390
before the dsl forms back it actually

266
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,790
has some security in a material 69

267
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:37,630
protocol so this would be important

268
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:41,860
later but it's got a security features

269
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,839
allegedly it's got TLS it's got all it

270
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,370
took elite mass it was designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

271
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,140
committee you can see big steering wheel

272
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,300
on revision<font color="#CCCCCC"> finds that no they keep</font>

273
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,160
bolting crap on and what clearly happens

274
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,380
if somebody goes who I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like this</font>

275
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,660
technology let's implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as parent</font>

276
00:11:53,380 --> 00:12:00,580
to this protocol which manages crap so

277
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:03,219
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know bloated rubbish the</font>

278
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,010
ssl/tls is optional<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was reading</font>

279
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,700
through this back in it's like oh we you

280
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:12,700
can use ssl/tls<font color="#CCCCCC"> its wrestle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or TLS it's</font>

281
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,410
recommended and some setups of it or

282
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,180
really solid where you chew all off you

283
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,949
know you saw my speeds the device they

284
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,199
ship a really good with this respect

285
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,660
where this client slide start on device

286
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,180
in your this mutual authentication it's

287
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,839
really good or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just use</font>

288
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:35,650

rubbish are built on stun soap XMPP

those words that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know some horrible</font>

303
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,510
enterprise developers love go here you

304
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,769
know if it's disgusting and a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

never implemented it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

307
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:26,079
be in there the attack surface is

308
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:30,540
absolutely enormous so you know we know

309
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">CP end of this is rubbish we know that</font>

310
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,199
your embedded device you know we knew

311
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:37,299
this already your little embedded router

312
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,920
in your house I mean there was another

313
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:42,129
talk earlier today which said<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

314
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,319
thing your router's crap your router has

315
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:46,089
bugger all security it never will

316
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,799
because the vendors aren't really

317
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,389
inclined to make secure routers yet

318
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,920
there's no market for it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want cheap</font>

319
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,139
they want fearful they want stuff you

320
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,998
can bang out a million of put them in as

321
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:58,839
they work internet light comes on you

322
00:13:54,999 --> 00:14:02,470
get the wifis it all is fine so you know

323
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:05,199
we know the cpn you know crap so uh I

324
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,389
see it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> please you know they've got you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the things being secured because you</font>

327
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:14,170
know their end of things have stuff like

328
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:16,569
money involved like billing and you know

329
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,219
if you go over your usage cap on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

331
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,699
more you know accounting and stuff I

332
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:23,799
know on some providers you've got like

333
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:26,529
50 gig a month and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they screw you</font>

334
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:28,829
if you go over that you know surely

335
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:31,179
there they've got some rock solid stuff

336
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:33,609
surely it's good quality enterprise

337
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:36,939
software you know we all know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

know enterprise is good um surely can't

00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:40,449
be that bad I mean surely they've you

340
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,540
know they've got this sorted they don't

world<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:11,529
we could you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> go after you know take</font>

00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:17,860
take the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I approach hack loads</font>

353
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,209
routers technically one at a time you

354
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">know or with our botnet you know</font>

355
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,649
scanning you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hack</font>

356
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,999
loads and loads and loads routers but

357
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:29,790
that takes time and effort and money<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

358
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:33,600
we just want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all now</font>

359
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,910
we want them cheap so you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

360
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,720
want to expend actual effort you know

361
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">real AZ I mean I used to be somebody who</font>

362
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,920
was on the thread after side of things I

363
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,230
used to do bad things people I used to

364
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,140
hack into<font color="#E5E5E5"> shading mess stuff up so I</font>

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,030
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people like me are lazy we</font>

366
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,910
want the easiest way to get stuff done

367
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:57,900
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to hack loads of stuff but we</font>

368
00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,150
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do very little so I thought well</font>

369
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,180
you could hack all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TPS or you can</font>

370
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:06,300
hack the ACS and in theory hacking an

371
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,489
ACS will be a lot faster because an ACS

372
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,040
can send commands to all the CPUs

373
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,960
attached to it so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just hacked</font>

374
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,640
the one box instead of hacking millions

375
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,620
box you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hack the one box then just run</font>

376
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,170
your script on all the millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes</font>

377
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,990
you get you know an instant wing and the

378
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool thing is if you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home and play</font>

379
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with some ACI software you'll</font>

380
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,020
discover that ACN software is amazing

381
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,210
for botnet commanding control because

382
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,370
that's literally what it is it's you've

383
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,560
got like run shell script on device

you've got like deploy binary is to

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,990
you've got all sorts of fun you've got

391
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,579
you know you can reflash firmware images

392
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,199
so you could you know create firmer

393
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,940
backdoors upload them and deploy them

394

all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> one go except they're designed</font>

395
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,010
for deployment at scale provisioning

396
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,720
hola you can you know turn that instead

397
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,840
use it as your provisioning server is

398
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,640
now my botnet or whatever arm or you

399
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,680
know you could just you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

400
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,410
mean have to think about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know i</font>

401
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,880
mean i have sat down and gone what could

402
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">i do with this and it's just infinitely</font>

403
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,910
it is you go on for days thinking of all

404
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,710
the horrible world domination you could

405
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,750
do like you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just change everyone's</font>

406
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,730
dns settings and one go to redirect them

407
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,150
all to something nasty like you know

408
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">shock images or whatever the world's</font>

your oyster fishing you could do fishing

410
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:32,370
its tail with this see I decided alone

411
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,780
at night AF server or a few ACS servers

412
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,310
and today I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about a</font>

413
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,950
particular one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around for</font>

414
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,010
quite a while called free ACS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if in</font>

415
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,180
you know it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow work because you</font>

416
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,169
know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are horrible horrible</font>

horrible piece

418
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:45,929
enterprise software you know their

<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise grade their enterprise</font>

421
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,389
completely disgusting the codes a mess

422
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:58,139
and you know you you know you go mad

423
00:17:54,389 --> 00:18:01,559
looking at us so yeah this free ACS are

424
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:03,719
about to have a very fun time so before

425

they put some carrying attention to it

around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while I actually think it's</font>

maintained by one person I was having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

463
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,909
look at it and it seems that you know

464
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:37,739
it's either a very small group<font color="#E5E5E5"> or one</font>

guy who writes it it uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tomcat on my</font>

466
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:43,710
sequel so it's written disgusting Java

467
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,539
which made me hate it even more I refuse

468
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,009
to program in Java and I normally refuse

469
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,070
to look at soft words written in Java

470
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:52,769
because just know I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go outside I</font>

ever actually patch the bug that I

489

disclosed and their next release you can

490
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,049
just go find more and then you can go

00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,480
the first thing I saw when I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

497
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:03,110
free ACF site looked up how to install

498
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:08,240
it yeah so they said do this on an

499
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:09,740
abundant 14.04 LTS server which is you

500
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,309
know that's a pretty old version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

501
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">do I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we run like 16 or 17 or you</font>

502
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,540
know we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's a bigger number</font>

503
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,660
than that anyways I'm not in a bun to

504
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,100
user ID go download this old is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 which</font>

505
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,500
isn't available you know to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

506
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,600
mirror you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know go back in</font>

507
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,070
time find the download and then I was

508
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,620
like right now how do i<font color="#CCCCCC"> install it on</font>

509
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:35,510
this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> already outdated box and</font>

510
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:39,080
it goes do this and nope you know you

511
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,770
see some problems here right go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

512
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:47,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">home directory w get this shell script</font>

513
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:49,580
from a non ssl/tls site<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so download a</font>

514
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,220
shell script over<font color="#CCCCCC"> plain text make it</font>

515
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,649
executable and then running as root you

516
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,440
know his secure deployment practice and

517
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:59,120
all that and then read on in chapter 4

518
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,770
to complete the remaining ten percent of

519
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> installation weeks we couldn't pop</font>

520
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:06,290
it into a crop shell script because you

521
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,729
know reasons and all the remaining

522
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,520
surely running a couple of shell

523
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,780
commands I could send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a patch for</font>

524
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,920
their shell script which it means that

525
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,960
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do the other ten</font>

526
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:19,340
percent but they'd still be serving a

527
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,110
shell script over you know HP on a

528
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:25,730
server that's probably trivially

529
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:28,459
compromised with hey um so the lowest

web or the web web login or maybe we

546
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,820
should put an extra w in there you know

547
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:17,630
I should send them a patch that's like

558
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,679
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes but yeah you can find</font>

559
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and they probably have admin XA PS</font>

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,050
sending it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server and the sha-1</font>

573
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,150
is just a shell on the password which is

574
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,190
also from

575
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database so there's some weirdness</font>

576
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,400
there you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something odd</font>

577
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,840
like it's literally passing a hash to do

578
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,900
off instead of sending the password in

579
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,770
plain no idea why but you know it

580
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't matter because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just</font>

581
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:32,050
capture that and just ship it across so

582
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,520
there's you know some weird smelly stuff

583
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,270
here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just wondering why are they</font>

584
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,300
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it hints at something weird</font>

585
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:43,270
so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I logged in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ACS server</font>

586
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:45,879
realized that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually made of</font>

587
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">access it was like an XSS test website</font>

588
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,790
instead of an ACS so I'm pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

589
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,010
parameter you can imagine will reflect

590
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,649
you know will reflect back some input

591
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,480
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> post also carries the most of a</font>

592
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,350
reflected exercise but some of them are

593
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,520
persistent some of them stick around and

594
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,320
because I was an idiot when I was

595
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,970
testing this and every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go back to</font>

596
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,889
reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to to make the same mistake</font>

597
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,240
and I don't differentiate between which

598
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,400
you know which payload for which

599
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,770
parameter when i'm spamming in my access

600
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,200
requests one of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keeps coming</font>

601
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,370
back and I'm like I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure where</font>

602
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,870
you're coming from I know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

603
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,899
other ones are coming from book that

604
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,699
alert box that just won't go away you

605
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,200
know it's following me around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ACS</font>

606
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,630
offer you know I click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on random bits</font>

607
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,030
from the alert box I'm like whoa hang on

608
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:34,240
where do you come from you know it's

609
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:36,310
like it's literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like damn vulnerable</font>

610
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,440
web app except you know it's got

611
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,540
optional you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know commanding control for</font>

612
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,670
a whole fleet of cpe devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> built in</font>

613
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,220
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> premium features</font>

614
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,960
so I've got some screenshots of the

615
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,750
excess bugs because everyone loves the

616
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,360
lair boxes and here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one and</font>

617
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">get from you can see it's like the</font>

618
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">lowest of the low of like finding XSS</font>

619
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,500
would just spam something in see what

620
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes out and yes another box pops what</font>

621
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:08,350
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and another one this one in a</font>

622
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:10,330
post request to somewhere oh that that's

623
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,820
the that's the bloody one the kept

624
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,290
popping up I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one I'd</font>

625
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,639
know where that one comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

626
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:20,290
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps coming back we've got more I</font>

627
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,510
started numbering them at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I</font>

628
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,010
started each request<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd records request</font>

629
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go okay I'm putting a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

630
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,470
for each one so they can uniquely

631
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,479
identify my cross-site scripting

632
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:35,210
vulnerable

633
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:37,690
yes so you know we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> XSS posts off</font>

634
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,440
but that's not quite what we're here for

635
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:44,600
what we want for world domination and

636
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,120
following demands we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be pre</font>

637
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,709
old we don't want have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a login</font>

638
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,770
we don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on default creds</font>

639
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:54,470
we want a pre auth exploit that's no

640
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,180
knowledge required of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Krebs it needs to</font>

641
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,680
be remote we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want any of this</font>

642
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,080
local nonsense we need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

643
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,530
fire it at something and it just bloody

644
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,570
works so needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be exploitable over</font>

645
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,370
the internet and we need a pre off now

646
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,250
that's already pretty much crossed off

647
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,629
all that post salt softer we found we

648
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,510
also wants to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us privileged access</font>

649
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,670
as in an admin role in the ACS server

650
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,540
except we're after we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want control the</font>

651
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:22,460
ACM server so we want admin on it um we

652
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,899
also want to be easy because you know we

653
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,950
won't do this cheaply we don't want to

654
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,750
spend weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and weeks and weeks</font>

655
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,640
developing some absurd memory corruption

656
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,470
exploit that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if I present</font>

657
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,090
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he players and ASL or</font>

658
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,780
and all that no we want something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

659
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:38,360
just works reliably easily cheaply and

660
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,070
we can you know build and weaponize in

661
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,290
like five minutes and deploy where we

662
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:47,659
can just ship it the minimum viable

663
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:50,570
world domination plan pinky and stuff so

664
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,130
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want you know and that</font>

665
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,020
seems like we've set you know pretty

666
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,180
high bar you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't</font>

667
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,889
often find these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in one</font>

668
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,240
basket you know you know some of these

669
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,370
seem to be often quite you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

670
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,130
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got three or four you</font>

671
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,530
know sometimes you get to you normally

672
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:10,040
don't get all four and one go this time

673
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:18,020
we did this time you know we hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

674
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:21,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">jackpot with what's coming up next with</font>

675
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:24,260
the actual jackpot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> preauth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font>

676
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:26,959

677
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,280
like the wall and trumped and all that

678
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,010
you know it's not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like bigger than</font>

679
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">its hands so it's huge the pre-op attack</font>

680
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:36,560
surface is literally enormous so because

681
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,060
it has to interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> for tier 069 clients</font>

682
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,490
you've got a whole client-server model

683
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,158
there you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got as well as like the</font>

684
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,799
admin doing

685
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,590
admins door from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACS you also fatir</font>

686
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:50,340
all 69 clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPS have to communicate</font>

687
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,199
with it and do stuff at the same time so

688
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,720
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at it and the first thing</font>

689
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">that CP device sends when it's talking</font>

690
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,200
to an ACS is the cwp notify of yes hi

691
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:02,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm here and I stayed looking at and I</font>

692
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">found it was surprisingly difficult to</font>

693
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,429
find a good sample one these eventually

694
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:14,340
I found one um and it's xml and it's

695
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:19,169
disgusting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I won't oh no oh no no no</font>

696
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:23,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">no I just xml know some found a demo see</font>

697
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:25,739
wmp client and this is the nonsense that

698
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:27,779
it sends and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just loads of</font>

699
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:29,220
parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> and loads of fields and just</font>

700
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,049
loads and loads and loads of attack

701
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,919
surface to play with their it just

702
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:41,879
enormous so we've got all of this to

703
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:45,269
play with and I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML xml</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Java you</font>

704
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:48,359
know we're an enterprise land here so at

705
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:50,700
first I tried closing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML you know I</font>

706
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,320
tried messing about with the trying

707
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,419
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had caused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know cause</font>

708
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,399
server to hang I got it to cease

709
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,739
responding i got just fall over and die

710
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,889
with various loops and stuff in the XML

711
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:04,499
I got bored looks like Hayes<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML so said</font>

712
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:07,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cwp</font>

00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:09,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">notify that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't involve having to</font>

714
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,200
write any XML at all or deal with this

715
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:14,789
XML parser so immediately<font color="#CCCCCC"> said the XML</font>

716
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,539
is out of scope so look for something

717
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:20,849
else I could attack so yeah there's the

718
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:23,220
XML but I hate XML you don't want to

719
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:26,279
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it you know I just know I want</font>

720
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do other things with my life that</font>

721
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,899
example that I that example there is

722
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,460
missing a header missing the base of

723
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:38,299
golf header so don't they use basic odds

724
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:42,570
to identify the devices and do stuff

725
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:44,460
yeah okay let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's see where we</font>

726
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:49,168
got here you know this possibly some fun

727
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:53,009
here so basically in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 03 MP notify</font>

728
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:54,860
messages is used for the passwords

729
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:57,170
optional some people require

730
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,750
password some implementations require

731
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:02,750
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can pass so only you know</font>

732
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:05,510
proper clients can talk to the ACS but

733
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,850
ever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> username is actually used by</font>

734
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,920
the ACS identify the device in some

735
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:11,449
fields for some circus quite often

736
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,309
that's like a customer number of

737
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is the username in a few</font>

738
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:18,379
device would take an apparent so the

739
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:19,970
user name parameter is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's put into</font>

740
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuffs and it smashed with then it gets</font>

741
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,559
terraced and it gets handled so you know

742
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,330
this there could be something there and

743
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">also when I looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the speck of you</font>

744
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,600
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> face of goth is you know what</font>

745
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,100
stopped you can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a username</font>

746
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,809
field in it it's really loose you can

747
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">stick them over the hell you want so</font>

748
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:37,340
long as you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mangle hv</font>

749
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,610
headers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we straight to play around</font>

750
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:45,199
and we found something<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick when</font>

751
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:48,860
I stuck in a quote we found the sequins

752
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,690
action bug which disappointingly I

753
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,600
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to reliably exploit</font>

754
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,970
something useful yet but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine you</font>

755
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,730
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine because that doesn't</font>

756
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,500
matter you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we'll find other books</font>

757
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:04,370
there's a lengthy sequel query which

758
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:07,100
when the device registers it gets

759
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:09,439
inserted and then later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on when the</font>

760
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,918
admin does something and it queries that

761
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,260
table the input<font color="#E5E5E5"> the single quote you've</font>

762
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,240
jammed in gets stuck into another sequel

763
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:19,850
query and because it's coming from the

764
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,440
database it's seen as trusted it ends up

765
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,120
somewhere it ends up somewhere else and

766
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,250
ends up<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out breaking something</font>

767
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,439
else along the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is horrible</font>

768
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,480
chain of disgustingness that leads to

769
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">your entire race their server is going</font>

770
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,299
nope no<font color="#CCCCCC"> theater says nope not doing it</font>

771
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,830
can't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the problem is if you</font>

772
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:39,379
screw up with your sequel injection

773
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:42,070
attempt you brick the ACS it<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts</font>

774
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:45,169
working so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got one shot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's like</font>

775
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,580
let's let's not do that let's find

776
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:48,500
something easier because I'm lazy and

777
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm sick of reimaging this<font color="#E5E5E5"> VM every you</font>

778
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,120
know reverting snapshot going up bricked

779
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,949
it again revert snapshot sit there and

780
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,629
wait while the computer chokes along for

781
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,350
a bit and eventually goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we can</font>

782
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:02,419
test it again and another one oak broke

783
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:05,959
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start so there was you know</font>

784
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:08,480
we didn't get lucky there but hey we

785
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,490
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else username</font>

786
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,530
completely unsanitized as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned it</font>

787
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">also shows up in the UI bunch signs from</font>

788
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:17,120
the admin sighs so new login to the a

789
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,580
CSS I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> min to do your acs admin things</font>

790
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,500
you know to cut off that BTW customer

791
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,230
hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid the bills at six months to</font>

792
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,770
you know check usage<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy a firmware</font>

793
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,120
update to fix some nasty bugs whatever

794
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:32,900
the user name field pops up and

795
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,678
surrendered in HTML well once another

796
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,500
box in there exceeds made of excess and

797
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,270
I thought yeah maybe we can do that

798
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,370
justjust full deployed I normally hate

799
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,720
cross-site scripting right I think the

800
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,000
cross-site scripting normally is was

801
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,340
useless thing in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> until I</font>

802
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,330
started doing this this is the first

803
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,959
time of may cross site scripting

804
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:57,260
actually useful and fun because what we

805
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,130
do next will shock you probably not but

806
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:03,740
anyway that's a click they titled

807
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:09,139
trivially exploitable excess happens so

808
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:11,600
it worked from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> username that we send</font>

809
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:14,960
we stick our script alert whatever in

810
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,409
and then when the admin logs in later on

811
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,859
weeks later<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever suddenly in our box</font>

812
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:23,929
so like okay so from an unauthenticated

813
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:25,489
somewhere off on the internet land we

814
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get an alert box into the admin</font>

815
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:30,379
session you can see where this is going

816
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:33,200
now you know some limitations you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

817
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:34,520
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got Caroline it's in it gets</font>

818
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,928
passed through a bunch of sequel

819
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,730
statements as well as we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

820
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,619
break anything so we've really really

821
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,560
really careful with it kind of not

822
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,850
really you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have some</font>

823
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,379
restrictions but they're not that

824
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:51,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">serious and this is a screenshot of it</font>

825
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:54,080
works you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got the alert box yay</font>

826
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:57,139
you know we login as admin um it pops up

827
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,790
and success and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like okay because</font>

828
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,520
he's the Carolyn the character length

829
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,350
limit in there we can't fit like an

830
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,109
entire big blob<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jay s and they're sooo</font>

831
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:08,690
fun thing this is like can we load a

832
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:12,170
script from somewhere remote and if he's

833
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:14,690
a short enough domain name like say x SS

834
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,730
IO or something you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get one</font>

835
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three-letter ones on the two-letter</font>

836
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">tlds is loathsome available it's get</font>

837
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,990
some short yes you can

838
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,599
can easily get your script in got a

839
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:29,720
remote script executing it just

840
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:32,089
magically worked we had you know loading

841
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,250
in remote jazz which made testing stuff

842
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:35,720
way easier because now what I could do

843
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,550
is I could just start changing the jazz

844
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,640
and the remote side re<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in and see</font>

845
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,930
what was going on so we started to get

846
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,430
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're getting somewhere with</font>

847
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:48,560
this so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can check remote cast into</font>

848
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,359
the admin session<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the ovens logged</font>

849
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,279
in we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can probably take over the ACS</font>

850
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:55,580
right you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

851
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,960
something so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about little bit i</font>

852
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,700
started looking you is there any file

853
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,190
upload book so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can trivially exploit</font>

854
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,859
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was like a effort you know or i</font>

855
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:09,380
could deploy some threat i'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> add a</font>

856
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:12,589
user so i had to sit down write some

copy and paste it from Stack Overflow

859
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,390
because I had this little rule in my

861
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,379
domination type so as much copypasta as

862
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,618
we can to write the exploit you know as

863
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:26,390
much as laziness as much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 14</font>

864
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,550
year old from hack forums as we can get

865
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,980
with this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-hanging fruit</font>

866
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:34,369
deserves you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> low complexity</font>

867
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:36,230
exploits so there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF tokens or</font>

868
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,790
excess protections or any of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy</font>

870
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:41,750
OAuth security guides because this is

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,690
enterprise software written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java and</font>

872
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:47,290
it's crap so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> must send a post request</font>

874
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,529

00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,460
copy paste right edited a little bits do

879
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,040
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and see if it works because</font>

880
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:09,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">again we wanted low effort and right in</font>

881
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:12,859
this exploit oh yeah it works so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

882
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:14,750
a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the test this is this is the</font>

883
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:16,460
most disgusting<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of pie that I've</font>

884
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,020
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> written it's actually probably the</font>

885
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,080
worst piece of code of ever written but

886
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:24,589
it works you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over an ACS an ACS</font>

887
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,980
system with like so leopard so we inject

888
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:31,569
or excess payload in and we get a

889
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:34,299
response going you're you know cool

890
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:37,288
your device cool everything's fine you

891
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:40,449
just get this blob of crop back and then

892
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:41,979
we wait we spin off our server serving

893
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:44,410
our malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript and we sit</font>

894
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:48,578
there and we wait and then we wait for

895
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:50,379
the admin login so admin logs in you

896
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:53,829
know we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind the oven logs into</font>

897
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,539
the ACS the admin then loads the script

898
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:58,869
from our web server you know standard

899
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:02,109
soft and runs the script and magic

900
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:04,420
happens and what's really useful because

901
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:05,739
as a slight problem of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you've</font>

902
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,089
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> your whole thing set up how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

903
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:12,249
know which ones you've owned so in the

904
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:15,190
headers there is the referer header and

905
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:18,459
the refer tells you the URL of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACS</font>

906
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,079
you've just added an admin user to in a

907
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:22,299
later version the exploit added a

908
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,989
function to<font color="#CCCCCC"> parse that out and check if</font>

909
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:27,759
the credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've out of work but</font>

910
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:30,519
yeah it works we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can now add nap and</font>

911
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:32,079
user remotely by sending one post

912
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:33,609
request to be a CS and then just

913
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,229
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and waiting for once and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee</font>

914
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:40,449
boom we've got madman and this is what

915
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it looks like added a nice alert dialog</font>

916
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:43,539
for debugging purposes so the admin

917
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,529
would definitely know they've been

918
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:49,650
hacked and we use the very unsubtle

919
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:52,299
username<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass through of hacker hacker</font>

920
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,549
you know just just to be polite you know

921
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:57,190
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> acs admin logs in they go who's</font>

922
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:58,809
this user named hunter you know if you

923
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,209
won't be more stealthy you could change

924
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like totally legit or if you want</font>

925
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:05,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a bit of fun you could change is</font>

926
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,640
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ or something and feel free to</font>

you know feel free to do what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

928
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,279

929
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:17,709
user objectives and it's been added and

930
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:22,660

932
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the code the exploit code will be</font>

honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just burn</font>

1000
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:25,480
them the entire thing start from scratch

1001
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:27,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reading through the specs</font>

1002
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,650
and stuff for quite a while like I think

1003
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,599
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tiras Klein which</font>

1004
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,069
when I was like 17 years old has

1005
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,500
chatting to one of my uncle's is a

going on about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it he was saying that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1008
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,779
know he was explained to me that's how

1009
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,369
the ISP was able to log into my router

1010
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,829
remotely and you know fix my internet

1011
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:47,109
basically and he was like you know it's

1012
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:49,059
basically a huge back door and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1013
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:50,680
like oh I should look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this but the 17</font>

1015
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,180
no 17 early I didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the patience</font>

1016
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,970
to read through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the massive bloody PDF</font>

1017
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:00,819
of the spec and make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it it was</font>

1018
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:02,618
only a while later when<font color="#CCCCCC"> cherez hull said</font>

1019
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:04,808
doing his work on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I got</font>

1020
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:06,069
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting I went oh that's</font>

1021
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,809
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to mess with</font>

1022
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:09,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">ages ago but got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really bored and soft</font>

1023
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:12,730
you know it was made interesting and

1024
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:16,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've realized that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's screwed is too</font>

1025
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:18,339
much crap in it we could reimplement the

1026
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:20,410
whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from scratch way better</font>

1027
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:22,540
using modern technology that's not

1028
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:25,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">rubbish like you could do it with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON</font>

1029
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,849
set of XML and that removes all the XML

1030
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:28,940
parser issues which are never going away

1031
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:32,270
you could you know how

1032
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:49,220
proper mutual all proper crypto it does

1033
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:51,500
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen and so some of</font>

1034
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,660
those will have this stuff enabled on

1035
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,980
them and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ifc ones are pre-configured</font>

1036
00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:00,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IST settings I know with some they</font>

1037
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,780
know at least the micro tech one that I

1038
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,790
have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> home my tub you know if I wanted</font>

1040
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,540
have to input the stuff myself and let

1041
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:12,200
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to my advice which</font>
