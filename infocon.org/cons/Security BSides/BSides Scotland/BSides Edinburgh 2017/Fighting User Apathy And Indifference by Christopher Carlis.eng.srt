this problem will loop back around to

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,620
some more complaining then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

11

it's me up here talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea</font>

19
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,890
I had for like a half hour and then we

mighty news replication difference I'm a

penetration tester a member of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the red</font>

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,030
penetration testers I have a compulsive

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,280
need to tell you that I'm a penetration

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:44,079
tester and then talk about penetration

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,369
testing for a while so let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how</font>

28
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,979
did I get here<font color="#E5E5E5"> how did I get to be up</font>

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:53,439
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> complaining about user apathy and</font>

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:55,090

one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that there's always</font>

32
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,869
some debate about how to define it what

33
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,539
it really means same thing with red team

34
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:06,700
testing but essentially I'm a fake

39
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:18,839
but sorry mine's better

40
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,390
with most penetration test they are

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,670
focused on a specific area of an

42
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,559
organization security I but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

the external network with with a red

52

53
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:58,839
of it we get to get a bit more into the

for you now I don't want to go to jail

61
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:24,280
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to choose a text</font>

62
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,260
that well and I think they're effective

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,900
they follow through my level of

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,040
acceptable risk they're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,040
noticed they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be caught</font>

66
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,980
awesome I hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> it lazy I don't want to</font>

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,910
and yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the business for me I'm</font>

attacks is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to trump something</font>

72
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:58,060
that's flashing expensive and and

73
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:01,030
finally I don't feel any real need to

74
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,010
play by your rule I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel need to</font>

75
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,989
just stick to just the external or just

with with a disturbing degree of

118
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,060
part we're doing here is treating the

symptoms we're putting some band-aids on

120
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,520
some bullet wounds we have here yes they

121
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,410
work they do you know stuff they do what

122
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,469
they're pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to do the</font>

best they can but

124

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> often end up being more of a speed</font>

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,860
bump to an attacker rather than that

that brick wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're all hoping</font>

128
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:03,670
user education I love this will say

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,060
provide your<font color="#E5E5E5"> users with information</font>

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,890
say it's white I don't know what but

<font color="#CCCCCC">information security awareness training</font>

135
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,760
undeniably it's a good idea it's

136
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,740
critically important that we can't you

137
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:33,310
can't afford lycra<font color="#CCCCCC"> mass ignorance of the</font>

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:37,930
topic but everyone hates it everyone

139
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:40,510
even we as security professionals don't

140
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,330
like security awareness training so much

141
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,430
so that in a lot of places what have we

142
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,140
done we've taken the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">shut it over to the human resources</font>

145
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,520
information security awareness training

146
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,650
has turned into a 40-minute PowerPoint

147
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,229
slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> egg that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you click through as</font>

149
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,820
training and the annual harassment

150
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:10,659
training this is what we've done with

151
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:18,640
them and sadly I guess it's working as

152
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:20,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">intended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk about not here the</font>

human resources department at your

154
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:26,169
organization exists to protect the

155
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:29,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">company from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> employee so in that</font>

156
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:32,319

<font color="#E5E5E5">they wanted to do because when what if</font>

159
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:42,010
these users inevitably after<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiving</font>

160
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:45,310
training clicks a link in an email well

173
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:32,739

move again all right yeah that's it

175
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:40,420
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that's essentially what is</font>

176
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,860
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to its a way that that we</font>

177
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,890
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in a little bit of</font>

178
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:49,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">trouble</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if they don't follow the rules</font>

179
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:51,939
so we're fighting a battle here how does

180
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,220
look like we're doing do we have

181
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,330
technological solutions are they

182
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,610
expensive and do they annoy our users

183
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:04,570
yeah that's how we know they're working

184
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,530
we have user education is it boring yeah

185
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:11,470
that's tough how we know it's

186
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:15,579
educational right the user they're

187
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:21,520
informed they know but they don't care

188
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:24,280
they don't care enough to act and some

189
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,699
of the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we as information</font>

190
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,540
security professionals we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at</font>

191
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,760
making people<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Computers</font>

192
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Computers are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still tricky but getting</font>

193
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,270
juven<font color="#E5E5E5"> very actual people to care about</font>

194
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:42,570
something it's a bit outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> our core</font>

195
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,569
skills

196
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,400
we need to approach this problem in a

197
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,610
different way clearly what we're trying

198
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,430
yeah it's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what it</font>

199
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:06,930
suppose to do but it's going to continue

200
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:11,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem we can get back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

201
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,829
what we have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice probably</font>

202
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:18,599
relatively simple idea something that

203
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:22,050
our users could do do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a</font>

204
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:27,750
security better everybody needs the

205
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:30,719
magic don't click<font color="#CCCCCC"> every link in the</font>

209
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:46,950
to do it with the technological

210
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:49,860
solutions we have it trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell it</font>

211
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,080
there's like that's gonna get<font color="#E5E5E5"> burned the</font>

213
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,420
while but it's this message<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

215
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,680

<font color="#CCCCCC">Gloucester doll we might be we should</font>

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,990
you invest the help of marketing

219
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:27,890
professionals to sell security to our

220
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:30,630
users marking professional marketing is

221
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,210
telling people about an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

222
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:37,650
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to act I that's like exactly</font>

223
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,990
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want and all right yeah it's not</font>

224
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,540
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a completely new novel idea</font>

225
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,900
people look on the internet to find

226
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:48,180
references to it going back for years

227
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:54,449
but it doesn't seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be either widely</font>

228
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:56,189
implemented or well in connected but

229
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,500
that doesn't mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good idea</font>

230
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:02,000
you can see how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might hear about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

231
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,000
and say use marketing for sale security

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,700
users if they call it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense</font>

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:17,810
but online marketing is not what I do

234
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:26,240
and then the ideas sighs when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we head</font>

235
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:30,739
outside there we go when you head

236
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:38,420
outside I see advertisements billboards

237
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:42,530
logos everywhere you watch television

238
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:46,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's commercial product placement you</font>

239
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:49,610
go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and you're not using</font>

240
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:53,359
an adblocker some region advertisement

241
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,010
score when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> head into the office that</font>

242
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,480
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with advertising pretty much</font>

243
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:02,080
drops off hopefully penny will work and

244
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,420
what we have is more of a blank slate

245
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,089
this is where we could target our reach

246
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,430
our target audience this is where we

247
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,650
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity on every blank wall</font>

248
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:16,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> every screen on every internal</font>

249
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:19,550
website to get this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> this simple</font>

250
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">security idea where in front of the</font>

251
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:29,199
users not not look here during training

252
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:34,600
you can in front of them every deck and

253
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:41,260
marketing marketing can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure that</font>

254
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:45,080
this message is communicated defensively

255
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:48,680
effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication we'll talk more</font>

256
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,430
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in just a minute after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

257
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,410
messages yeah that's a commercial break

258
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,050
in my talk at the time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys try this</font>

259
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,640
one this is this is a pretty good son I

260
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,640
can't get it back in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> States but</font>

261
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm hoping to get a sponsorship deal all</font>

262
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,650
right fine maybe I<font color="#CCCCCC"> should not define</font>

263
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:17,949
it's not actually intermission going no

264
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:19,800
one get up and leave can hardly look at

265
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,690
me I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much sugar as it is I</font>

266
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,530
possibly too much caffeine today what do

267
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,940
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right let's say for the sake</font>

268
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,069
of argument that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm</font>

269
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,230
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like this idea maybe you think</font>

270
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,060
well how can we possibly get it going in

271
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,830
my organization I've been thinking about

272
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,699
that too<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have so much in common we</font>

273
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:42,670
should hang out how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this of</font>

274
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,890
what option make looking we can do it

275
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:48,360
internally it's quite likely that that

276
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:50,439
wherever you're working has some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

277
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,710
marketing personnel already working

278
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,500
there maybe you could look them illicit

279
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,680
their health and developing an internal

280
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,180
information security marketing campaign

281
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,410
they understand your corporate culture

282
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,120
they know what resources you have

283
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,990
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a good working</font>

284
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,280
relationship anything happen place all

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's great clear problems</font>

287
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,490
possibly coming up primarily is that

288

working on your security campaign is

289
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,450
probably not their job they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have their</font>

of Maya do this who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying for this I</font>

294
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,520
who was this idea who hates this idea

295
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,800
who's fighting with the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

296
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,920
or hate this idea corporate politics

297
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,240
always fun to feel it it's something

298
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">where you'll need to have done your</font>

302
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,820
directions find a champion in marketing

303
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,260

306
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:13,290
this is going to help solve a problem

307
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,290
that your company is having<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

308
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:20,699
look we hired an outside consultant to

309
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:22,929
do this work speaking as a consultant

310
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,679
hiring a consultant is often an

311
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,659
excellent idea the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eclipse you could</font>

312
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,630
contract the company fine company that

313
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:34,570
has the experience in both marketing and

314
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,549
security to come in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> help identify</font>

315
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,439
problems and weaknesses it and build

316
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:40,779
that information security marketing

317
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,640
campaign you could maybe try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fly past</font>

318
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:46,230
some of the internal politics you don't

319
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,539
need to pull from your marketing team

320
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:53,799
they're still obviously some problems

321
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:57,879
potentially consultants at the very

322
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:00,850
least cost money I don't know I didn't

323
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,440
do the math but there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a line item</font>

324
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,049
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the budget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who's going to pay for</font>

325
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">this Oh decisions need to be made we're</font>

326
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:09,580
back at politics so I think consulting

327
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:11,350
is a pretty good idea and you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,360
thinking this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secure work</font>

to stay safe over here in my consultant

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,550
merit they they offered their inputs or

406
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:59,550

433
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:17,159
found people doing more and more it

434
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,700
seems pretty cool is the gamification of

435

fishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> detention this is where anyone</font>

completely disagree with me as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

439
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:35,520
continue to talk so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where users</font>

440
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:38,639
are encouraged to report suspicious

441
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,980
emails not just because that training

442
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">said you should totally do that but</font>

443
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,619
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some sort of competition</font>

444
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:49,850
this some sort of contest they can

445
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:51,918
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> win some sort of prize and what</font>

deck it comes out a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font>

449
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:01,549
excitement it gets to users thinking

450
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,919
like hey I could win some maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too</font>

451
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:06,799
shabby prize by just reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> my emails</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a example of a security idea that</font>

has been marketed better you know we've

461

officious suspicious email and they

463

weren't really doing it but it took that

464
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,408
instead lows let's work with the human

491
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:35,779
the spectrum and there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

ineffective communication this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

kind of stuff that that left to our own

541
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:18,020
shouldn't feel like you have to be

542

constrained to whatever comfortable

543
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,490

558
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,240

559
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,590
of a way to get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the situation if</font>

you want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about penetration</font>

561
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,780
testing clearly I cannot shut up about

569
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,270
just be the stake but who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

carrots we should do saying accuses

573
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:30,630
aspect of the gamification like you know

574
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:32,790
if you're consistently not playing the

575
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:34,559
game you're failing every every fishing

576
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:38,760
test if you're becoming almost a

577
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:42,780
liability company because you suddenly

578
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,179
don't care it's punishment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

579
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,220
I've never liked the negative

580
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,559
reinforcement again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to deal</font>

581
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,190
with it but at a personal level I'm like

582
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:54,389
now let's not punish people it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

583
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,710
motivates them I think rather than

584
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">motivate some zzz's</font>

585
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:23,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok I see ok so like pushing the problem</font>

586
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:27,509
off on foot down so like they bring

587
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:28,860
their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> like vices I I'm always really</font>

588
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:30,389
they're like either bring their phone in

589
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,859
and then connect your corporate laptop

590
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:33,330
their phone and bypass that needed

591
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:35,249
restrictions next thing you know that

592
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,960
corporate laptops<font color="#E5E5E5"> popped and yeah</font>

593
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:41,749
actually I like from that happens this

594
00:32:36,960 --> 00:33:00,049
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> me doing it thank you I the other Oh</font>

595
00:32:41,749 --> 00:33:04,350
Becca now you have you all right I

596
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:10,070
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have to do this what I'm</font>

597
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:10,070
sorry I couldn't understand you yeah oh

598
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:28,678
yeah I'm definitely there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font>

599
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:30,658
I'm not pushing certainly different

600
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,289
different and I think any<font color="#CCCCCC"> congestion</font>

601
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:36,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">consultants full backing up in this on</font>

602
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:37,980
certain businesses or in certain fields

603
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:42,330
you get a test for and it's like ours

604
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:44,460
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fun healthcare you</font>

605
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:46,678
really hope that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care</font>

606
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,869
companies would have stuff locked down

607
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:53,549
and you have my health information know

608
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:56,668
some of the Skerries contest that that

609
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:58,139
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done are at a hospital and I was</font>

610
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:01,080
seriously considering trying to steal a

611
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:04,189
baby because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the level of</font>

612
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,189
access that I again

613
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:12,429
other organizations I've seen you know

614
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:15,909
certain financial places<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they know</font>

615
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:17,799
what their issues are they done a good

616
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,409
job of segmenting things off and locking

617
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:22,899
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> down so that it makes a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

618
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:27,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">more challenging for the tester really</font>

619
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:28,868
large organizations frequently have some

620
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:32,859
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're doing quite well and</font>

621
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:34,059
then and you're worried as a tester for

622
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:36,460
a little bit that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be hard</font>

623
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you find the fact that they're</font>

624
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,490
huge means they're screwing up a whole

625
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,839
bunch other stuff and can attack that

626
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:46,509
yeah definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain organizations</font>

627
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,679
are certain certain feel a little bit

628
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:53,260
more lockdown in others but it's not a

629
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,270
hard and fast rule there's been this

630
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:32,799
surprising the crafting security pretty

631
00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:41,109
much everywhere you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> so kiss me yeah</font>

632
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:43,599
the airport it's I mean it's an airport

633
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:47,828
security yeah we have we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

634
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:51,190
security theater same with your

635
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:52,780
organization the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's it does I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

636
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,910
to a certain degree like you're wearing

637
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">your your badge on a lanyard around your</font>

638
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,899
neck through all the people in your

639
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:02,259
organization wear them on their hips

640
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:06,450
damn I clip there or is it where your

641
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:10,780
lanyard around your neck<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's okay</font>

642
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:14,710
what if the attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we use a lot in</font>

643
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,510
physical penetration testing when we

644
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,020
spend the

645
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:21,420
I mentioned tailgating or following

646
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:25,250
people in the building we've actually

647
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,660
moved are moving away from that because

648
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,040
so because it is too easy because of the

649
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,899
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this like how do you tell</font>

650
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,910
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how to stop that</font>

651
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not like tell people not to do</font>

652
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:39,480
that or put a turnstile in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

653
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,760
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you want to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

654
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,130
turn styles are expensive will do an

655
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,380
attack that involves badge money you

656
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,680
have you know that keen on the editors

657
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:53,190
we have long-range<font color="#CCCCCC"> Badgerys proxmark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

658
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,430
invite that<font color="#E5E5E5"> badge so we target people</font>

659
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:59,790
coming in heading out at the coffee shop

660
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:04,140
and steal the badge and make a clone and

661
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:06,240
walk in and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm asked on nine how</font>

662
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,220
do we how do we stop that I can talk

663
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some more technological solutions</font>

664
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,689
which are going to be like oh maybe move

665
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,630
I class readers are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different bag to</font>

666
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,940
put numbered pads on the doors so that

667
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:21,140
when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to punch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an echo in the</font>

668
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:24,030
changes Elise in the sensitive areas but

669
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,279
something else<font color="#CCCCCC"> Falls Rahman is have your</font>

670
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:29,010
folks where their badges on the lanyard

671
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,720
around their map as opposed to on your

672
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,490
side because mine because it's hard for

673
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,410
me to get a read my holding that up to

674

your chest and steal your badge that way

675
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:40,200
it's not perfect solution but it makes

676
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,380
my job a little bit harder also you have

677
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,549
badge discipline had your badge always

678
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,500
on display while you're walking around

679
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the facility but when you leave when you</font>

we really want me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

693
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,710
degree i think it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you</font>

can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like oh we've talked</font>

695
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,640
about scenario we're like tailgating

696
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:49,800
happens you need to like scare anyone

697
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,190
for a week by having like really insane

698
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,690
entry and exit procedures and maybe

699
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,640
don't give them all the information but

700
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,550
lets the rumor mill<font color="#CCCCCC"> vela circulate that</font>

701
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,740
there's a security problem so um you

702
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:04,590
know exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened but you've</font>

703
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,560
raised everyone's awareness by causing

704
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:49,110
some hats on their life<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know i</font>

00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,820
current it's like movies and then they

708
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,290
had swapped out like the curious it was

709
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,290
like the new Mission Impossible movie

710
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:03,330

719
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:27,330
exactly but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most often think I</font>

720
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,520
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Cure works probably had</font>

721
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,770
something else in our breakroom Jane

722
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,740
like don't give out information over the

723
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:36,420
phone and we test their people on that

724
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,950
and most part yeah we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give out</font>

725
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,960
information of a song which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is annoying</font>

726
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,359
if you're calling in as an employee

727
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:48,270
trying to get information out of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

728
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:50,040
yeah it does happen but I I doubt in

729
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,860
that case that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the security</font>

730
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,500
person coming up with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on her own it</font>

731
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:58,800
was more likely that she teamed up with

732
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,260
someone in that in the movie studio to

733
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,540
like hey Camille he was already working

734
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,180
