1
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:12,879
welcome to this very exciting topic

2
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:15,849
around yet another talk on gdpr this is

3
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:19,720
me my name is master Omega here as most

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:22,060
people know me around these parts I am

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,820
NOT a privacy expert I will start by

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,580
saying that but in my job as an

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,990
information security person especially

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,880
this officer call it what you will

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,190
I actually see my job very much as a

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,019
translator kind of between business and

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,890
take people to try and get them to talk

12
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:39,850
the same language

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:42,460
so this talk today is really my musings

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,920
around questions that I've either been

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,690
asked things that I've seen statements

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,480
that I've heard people make where I'm a

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,780
bit like really not so sure that's

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,519
correct and I thought you know I could

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,719
probably give anybody who's kind of in

20
00:00:54,519 --> 00:01:00,219
the developer side just some concrete

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,829
help couple of things you can remember

22
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,729
without being an expert on gdpr to try

23
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,590
and figure out what are the right

24
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:08,200
questions to ask at the start of the

25
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,740
project we will talk about that at the

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,090
start of a project quite a bit today

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,919
mainly as I said I'm going to try and

28
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,290
give you enough information enough

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,280
questions to be able to be able to ask

30
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,110
the right questions

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,939
but when in doubt go and speak to your

32
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,009
data protection officer or privacy team

33
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,798
I know there is someone in your company

34
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:32,380
who does this find out who they are and

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:35,049
talk to them so this might be a complete

36
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,820
guide to DPR this will not be he'll

37
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,200
happy to hear a legal training session

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,359
we're not really going to talk about

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,820
security even though this is a security

40
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,570
conference I do know that we're not

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,199
gonna be talking about breach

42
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,029
notifications or bangs or jurisdictions

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,220
so now you might ask yourself err what

44
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:55,020
will you be talking about then

45
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,880
it's as I said general awareness around

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,770
gdpr it's going to help you ask the

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,360
right questions and we're going to talk

48
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:06,240
about that privacy by design and by

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:10,199
default I promise you GTR is not a bad

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,970
thing so these are some of the

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,079
statements that I've heard in the last

52
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,239
couple of years you might identify you

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,510
might have heard some of those if you

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,760
have some of your own or even questions

55
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,109
please let me know even now or later on

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,010
Twitter or afterwards if you want to

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,930
catch me I'm happy to add that too to

58
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,030
this hopefully by the end of this talk

59
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,590
we'll all have answered and we can kind

60
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,140
of go true or false to all of these

61
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:44,030
things yeah I would I would spoil it for

62
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,260
you if you think some of this is true

63
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,310
anyway we'll go through the talk we'll

64
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:53,030
see how we can answer all of these

65
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:56,160
questions for you so first things first

66
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,930
gdpr is really not about compliance and

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,530
I think this is the most difficult thing

68
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,850
for most developers and I'm going to I

69
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,410
know most of you probably aren't

70
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,239
developers here today or some of you

71
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,100
might not be that's okay it will give

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,470
you some information to go and talk to

73
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,480
your developer team but the difficult

74
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,709
thing for us to understand is that gdpr

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,590
is not about compliance

76
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,530
we like statements as things like PCI

77
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,980
right PCI has got a list of stuff you do

78
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:26,130
all these things you're compliant great

79
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,738
ISO 27001 is similar and that it gives

80
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,859
you a list of things that you can do

81
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,820
gdpr

82
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:35,120
is not like that so this is a note to

83
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,858
self if you go out there and you see a

84
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,739
vendor or a new system that says we're

85
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,920
fully gdpr compliant there's no such

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:47,239
thing there really isn't gdpr is not a

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,679
compliance law it's all about risk-based

88
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,840
security one risk-based security and

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,820
risk-based privacy it says you need to

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,040
do the best to your ability in a

91
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,290
particular situation which means all

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,409
situations will be different which means

93
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,160
nothing will be exactly the same

94
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,950
no one's they will be exactly the same

95
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,420
next thing so this is Alice it really is

96
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,700
the most difficult thing for us to get

97
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,130
our minds around that gdpr is just not

98
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:18,190
about compliance you can't be compliance

99
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:21,209
to GDP are it's not only about consent

100
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,860
that's the other thing we often hear

101
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,130
it's really about marketing there's a

102
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,680
whole different law called it's nice

103
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,360
nice to say the pecker which is about

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,570
marketing I'll touch on that a little

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,420
bit later cookies again this is not GDP

106
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,930
are it's related but it's really not GDL

107
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,880
and GTL actually is also not about

108
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,620
information security but not only about

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,360
information security it's a very small

110
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,360
part of the whole GDP our thing

111
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,460
this is what do DPR is about this is

112
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,130
actually word for word from recital for

113
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,190
in the GDP our it says that the process

114
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:08,290
in the personal data is it designed or

115
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:11,830
should be designed to serve mankind now

116
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:14,470
that is not an you know a very great

117
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,690
objective I don't know what is so if we

118
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:22,450
get this right people I'm telling you

119
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:24,100
the power is yours first I'm going to

120
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,900
spend a few minutes just talking about

121
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,940
different terms and to clarify a few

122
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,010
things and I think it is important as

123
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,930
with all conversations remember I told

124
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,659
you my job is a little bit about being a

125
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,030
translator half of that is just to make

126
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,650
sure that when I say a thing and when

127
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,239
you say a thing we're actually talking

128
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,400
about the same thing even if we use the

129
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,330
same words so it really is important to

130
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,109
understand that there might be

131
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,630
differences in interpretation the first

132
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,260
thing I want to talk about is privacy is

133
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,540
not security now many of us are security

134
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,640
experts and that's great but being a

135
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,400
security expert does not make you the

136
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,469
privacy expert those are two completely

137
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,390
different disciplines they come from

138
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,740
different they look at the world very

139
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:11,050
very differently there is some overlap

140
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,210
my personal opinion is you are one or

141
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,180
the other in experts in one or the other

142
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,380
you're not normally an expert in both

143
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,900
security is about protecting the

144
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,610
business it's about being the castle

145
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,260
wall is about being the moat it's about

146
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,480
being the praetorian guard standing in

147
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:31,310
the front watching what's going in and

148
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:33,320
what's going out if I had to sum it up

149
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,960
in one word I would say it's about

150
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,969
confidentiality

151
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,979
whereas privacy has got nothing to do

152
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,600
with the business it's got nothing to do

153
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,980
with the business model that's got

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,290
nothing to do with how the business

155
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,350
makes money it really is about an

156
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,820
individual person the question you

157
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,090
should be asking yourself when it comes

158
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:59,030
to privacy is not can we do something

159
00:06:52,090 --> 00:07:00,739
but should we and this is the second

160
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,510
thing I think is really really important

161
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,550
to understand when it comes to privacy

162
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,770
when you're thinking about gdpr you're

163
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,020
not thinking about how do I protect the

164
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:13,190
business you shouldn't be thinking about

165
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,469
how can I reduce my fines that's really

166
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,650
not what GDP is about GDP are is about

167
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,510
protecting an individual and I think

168
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,669
this is what makes the job of a day

169
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,560
protection officer very difficult

170
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,740
because even though they're getting paid

171
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,020
by a company their job really is not to

172
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,890
work for that company but to work for

173
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:37,460
individual people which could be

174
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,840
customers employees any kind of you know

175
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,120
the personal data that that company's

176
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:46,099
processing the DPO is a champion of

177
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,920
those people not for the business it's a

178
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,590
very busy slide don't worry about it

179
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,360
I've put down these two terms so some

180
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,030
people use them interchangeably personal

181
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,260
data PII very technically speaking

182
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,929
they're not the same thing

183
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,900
PII is used more in America it's defined

184
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,580
by NIS t and in HIPAA law and so on

185
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,380
where it's personal data the worth of

186
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,919
actually used and defined and GDP our

187
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:12,200
own European law graphically I would say

188
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,200
all PII is personal data but not all

189
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,030
personal data is PII again does really

190
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,000
matter don't take this away the thing

191
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,929
you need to remember as I said before

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,800
make sure you're actually talking about

193
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,320
the same thing

194
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,900
if someone says PII and you think PRI

195
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,150
just raise a question and just say can I

196
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,010
just stop you and

197
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,870
are we talking about the same thing if

198
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,000
in your company you use those words as

199
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,039
the same thing fair enough but if you

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,020
work in a global organization and maybe

201
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,120
you've got American cut colleagues be

202
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,710
very careful because what they say and

203
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:48,250
what you think they're saying might not

204
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:51,460
be the same the next term I want to

205
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,590
quickly talk about is deep breath

206
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,890
because to pronounce this is see it

207
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,650
anonymization yes it's the last I'm

208
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,260
gonna say that word that thing up there

209
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,060
this is actually defined in the GDP are

210
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,460
about what that is and how that should

211
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,020
be how that you work and I think it's a

212
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,800
pretty easy concept to understand for

213
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:14,490
most developers it's using a user ID an

214
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,810
alias of some sort which isn't actually

215
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,630
identifying a personal record so you

216
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,119
might have one table that has you know

217
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,910
name address all of the personal stuff

218
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,230
around one person in there but then for

219
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,120
all your other stuff it might be a

220
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,980
separate table so you have the user ID

221
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,120
so you could tie those together if you

222
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,130
had both sets of data so there's a

223
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,600
reversible process it's not complete and

224
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,280
on ization where you never know what the

225
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,440
original was you can reverse that

226
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,079
process but important to remember here

227
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,290
and GDP are actually says less is that

228
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,290
data or the table that you have which

229
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,490
you use to reverse the process to

230
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,880
re-identify

231
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,080
individuals it must be kept separately

232
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,110
so if you are using this and it's a

233
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,430
really good idea by the way and keep you

234
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,160
know all your personal data to one side

235
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:07,689
keep it separate and don't allow people

236
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,490
access data subject if you're wondering

237
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,560
what that is but it's just the person

238
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,530
the individual whose data we were

239
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,239
looking at in most cases it's probably

240
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,740
going to be your end user not in all

241
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
cases if you're talking about

242
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,850
applications with logins it's probably

243
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,220
going to be your customers they were

244
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,780
talking about HR systems for example if

245
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,330
you know your end user is going to be

246
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,980
the HR person but the data inside it

247
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,540
actually gonna be all your employees so

248
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,990
not in all cases that in most cases it

249
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,439
helps you to think about your end user

250
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,900
and then the subject access

251
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,000
so just quickly gonna explain this what

252
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,620
this is if you don't know and this is

253
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,090
one of the reasons it's important to

254
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,010
come to this talk and listen to this

255
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,710
information and take that away back to

256
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,620
your to your company because what

257
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,790
happens is any data subject any person

258
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,460
whose data your process can actually

259
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,230
call you up and say hey company I want

260
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,240
to know where you know about me write it

261
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,800
down tell me where this information is

262
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,150
what data do you hold about me and you

263
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,979
know what's gonna happen is your privacy

264
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,569
team's gonna probably answer that call

265
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,370
they are not going to be looking for

266
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,010
their data they're going to come back to

267
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,150
you and say what data do we hold about a

268
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:20,160
person so it's good to have that in mind

269
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,750
when you start designing something from

270
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,350
scratch isn't that lovely I know we all

271
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,520
like to retrofit legacy systems later on

272
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,260
but if you're designing something from

273
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,030
beginning keep this in mind how

274
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:34,370
searchable is it can I pull out

275
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,370
individual records is it easy to do

276
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:42,930
right these related laws as I said I'm

277
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,339
going to mention them briefly so the one

278
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,050
is the privacy in electronic

279
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,570
communications regulations for pecker

280
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,579
this sits alongside data protection

281
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,350
regulation and that is exactly it it's

282
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,330
the electronic communication so this is

283
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,270
all about those marketing emails that

284
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,740
you need consent for I'm not going to go

285
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,510
into detail on that I'm just telling you

286
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,510
there is a different thing don't blame

287
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,400
gdpr for everything unfortunately I

288
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,290
think what happened last year and I saw

289
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,699
some write-ups about this so it's not

290
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:14,040
just my opinion some other people that

291
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:16,590
concur with that is that in the UK we've

292
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,610
had data protection law for about 20

293
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,530
years and this 20 communications

294
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,380
regulations have been in place we'll

295
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,060
pretty much the same around 15 years

296
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:29,310
we've just been doing it really badly

297
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,560
we've just not been doing things

298
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,819
particularly very well if you edit their

299
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,160
data protection very well

300
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,740
GDP azam no-brainer it really doesn't

301
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,660
change many things but we haven't been

302
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,270
doing that so what people did last year

303
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,219
is to comply with Becker and comply with

304
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,550
data protection law which they hadn't

305
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,480
done before they use this big o GD P R I

306
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,019
need to ask you for recon sent about

307
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,389
stuff which is unfortunate I mean it

308
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,889
served the purpose of businesses but

309
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:02,019
it's kind of misinformation that's out

310
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:04,750
there now data Protection Act 2018 so

311
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:07,720
this is a new UK law that was brought

312
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,810
out last year and this is a long GPR it

313
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,970
further defines things within UK law

314
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,949
which isn't defined by European law

315
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:19,120
things like national security and

316
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:21,160
immigration so yeah it just know it is

317
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,010
there it sits alongside in very

318
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,269
particular circumstances again if you

319
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,079
don't know go and talk to your privacy

320
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:31,240
team they're the experts on the stuff

321
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,870
the big thing around from GDP are is

322
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:38,019
this concept of privacy by design and by

323
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,149
default it's actually defined an article

324
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:43,630
25 if you want to go and look it up in

325
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:47,620
the GDP are and it says any system that

326
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:50,189
processes personal data you must design

327
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,079
it from the start with privacy in mind

328
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,060
now again remember that's that mind

329
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,120
shift because privacy is not about the

330
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,250
business privacy is about the people

331
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:06,269
whose data we collecting or processing

332
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,269
and it's quite a might shift to remember

333
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:14,430
now the next thing I'm gonna quickly

334
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:17,319
stop on is lawful basis of processing

335
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,479
there are six different bases for lawful

336
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,639
processing so processing is just why we

337
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,720
need your data

338
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,310
unfortunately consent is at the top I

339
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,399
really wish they just stuck it at the

340
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,899
bottom so it wasn't as obvious to people

341
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,910
because really consent should be your

342
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,889
very very last resort there are so many

343
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:36,579
if there are five other things that you

344
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:38,170
could possibly use most cases and most

345
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:41,349
businesses I would say sits between

346
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,779
contacts and legal obligation so for

347
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,180
example Amazon right I buy something on

348
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:47,260
Amazon they say great we're going to

349
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,760
deliver it where do you want us to

350
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,860
deliver it I have to give them an

351
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,180
address to deliver to if I don't do it

352
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,949
they can't fulfill their end of a

353
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,479
contract that's as easy as that they

354
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:56,560
don't need to ask my permission to

355
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,540
collect that data

356
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,628
because if I don't do it they can't

357
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:05,009
fulfill their contract that's it legal

358
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:08,769
obligation so this is for example your

359
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:10,449
you're an employee your employer the

360
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:14,019
company you work for has a legal

361
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:17,079
obligation to share your name your tax

362
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:19,209
your ni number national insurance time

363
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,699
bearing your salary details they have to

364
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,410
share that with HMRC they're not going

365
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:25,449
to come around and say oh by the way do

366
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,120
you give us consent to share this

367
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:29,589
information with HMRC they don't have to

368
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,910
do that because it's not based on

369
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:35,350
consent it's based on a legal obligation

370
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,850
so the next time you sign an employment

371
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,319
contract and they say oh and by the way

372
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,800
you give us consent to process your

373
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,389
information or maybe don't tell them

374
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,199
before we slide the contract you know

375
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:48,809
afterwards go have a word this is the

376
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,550
easy one to remember

377
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:56,649
consent really is not the be-all and

378
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:58,359
end-all of a lot lawful processing some

379
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:05,439
GDP oh joy to tell people love about

380
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:07,480
this ended legal rights of data subjects

381
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:10,000
so these are all the rights that data

382
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,220
subjects have I'm not going to go into

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,769
detail on all of these but I'm gonna

384
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,620
highlight a few which i think is

385
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:21,370
important to know when you're developing

386
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:25,059
an application or new system the first

387
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,680
one is a right of access so in this kind

388
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,819
of this this is the subject access

389
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,969
request thing we were talking about

390
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:33,219
earlier at the point of collection you

391
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,889
have to be able to tell st. subjects and

392
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,050
users people who stay - you have what

393
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,029
you're collecting why you're collecting

394
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,219
it what you're going to do with it and

395
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:44,439
how long you'll be keeping it as well as

396
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,480
who you'll be sharing it with so this

397
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:48,429
has to be before you start collecting it

398
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,750
so this is these are the privacy notices

399
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:51,699
that you see pop up whenever you're

400
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,249
trying to fill in a form leave a comment

401
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:55,479
yes yes yes yes of whatever but they you

402
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:57,540
know you have to show people that

403
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,559
information obviously as a developer

404
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,939
usually be defining any of this

405
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,329
information but you should be asking

406
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:04,220
these questions

407
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,010
you know this would be a good time to

408
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,240
say great once we you know know to want

409
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,700
to collect this data we're on this

410
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,770
screen I need to give people privacy

411
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,930
notice Cullen promising people DPO where

412
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:20,210
is it I need to be able to answer all of

413
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:23,600
these questions rights rectification

414
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:26,690
so if stuff is incorrect a data subject

415
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,520
the user have the right to actually make

416
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,500
you updater to make you change it what

417
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,580
does this mean for me as a developer

418
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,310
well it means that everything can be

419
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,360
changed names can be changed surnames

420
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,399
can be changed

421
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,860
date of birth can possibly be changed

422
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,400
especially if you've made a mistake

423
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:45,500
email addresses can be changed so make

424
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,940
sure that those fields are updated all

425
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,860
in whatever system you're designing

426
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,780
don't use an email address for example

427
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,370
as your key identifier in the table

428
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,580
because what happens if I have to update

429
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:58,250
that even if my email address is the

430
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,810
username to log into a system if I then

431
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,530
tell you actually I've changed my email

432
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,950
address

433
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,750
do I have to open a whole new account

434
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,490
that seems a bit silly to me as a user I

435
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,170
just want to say oh I'm using a new

436
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,900
email address can I just use that as my

437
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:20,090
username now is that easy enough to do

438
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:22,100
right to aresia when I speak to

439
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:25,010
developers this one actually grows

440
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,899
tentacles like bosons and lakes people

441
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,970
have loads of questions around this the

442
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,010
first thing you have to know is that the

443
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:35,000
right ear erasure is not an absolute

444
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:39,200
right you don't always have to delete

445
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,810
all of the data it's for me I found it

446
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,380
very difficult explained so I went to my

447
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:48,250
favorite privacy Twitter account the

448
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,380
privacy puffin explains this very well

449
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,940
if it's a law contract still in place or

450
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,500
a life-and-death scenario that requires

451
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,720
your personal data to be processed an

452
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,790
erasure is not available and some of

453
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,970
those laws could be just the company law

454
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,920
so the companies act in very broad terms

455
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,480
again I'm not a legal expert here in

456
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,640
very broad terms the Companies Act

457
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,160
normally says you have to keep

458
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,690
transactional data for six years seven

459
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,280
years six plus one or something today

460
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,470
effect

461
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,300
so to prove that your company's done

462
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,150
business with you or a company is done

463
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,340
business with a client they have to keep

464
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,170
those records so a client can't come and

465
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,320
call you and say you need to delete my

466
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,810
data because the transaction says you

467
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,210
bought this table on this date for this

468
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,250
amount this person but that's business

469
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,720
historical transactional data for

470
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,850
accounting purposes they need that

471
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,150
information the cut it can't just be

472
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:43,689
deleted so what does this mean for me as

473
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,820
a developer it's ask that question know

474
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,630
that not everything must be able to be

475
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:52,360
erased but some things might so how does

476
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,770
that affect how I architecture this

477
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,439
system you know talk to you legal your

478
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,930
privacy people which data might have to

479
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,850
be deleted in the future because if you

480
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,220
delete fields from a record does that

481
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,199
break the system what happens to your

482
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,200
logs when you do that that really

483
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,880
awkward could you put the data that

484
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,530
might be have to be deleted in the

485
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,450
future could you put that in a separate

486
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,250
table so you can delete stuff from there

487
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,370
that doesn't matter but your main stuff

488
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:27,250
is not affected those are the things you

489
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:28,689
need to ask questions about the right to

490
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,390
restrict processing and the right to

491
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,080
object so again this is your your users

492
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,640
your data subjects they have this white

493
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,649
can they do learn in your system if I

494
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,880
call up a company and say hey I don't

495
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,800
know what you've got my data from I

496
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,170
think it's illegal you need to stop

497
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,840
processing my data can you do that in

498
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,930
your application can you flag a record

499
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,300
that says you know this this must be

500
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,920
stopped processing ie it doesn't come

501
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,530
into reports it's not used for

502
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,510
aggregated data all of it you have to

503
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:01,540
literally stop processing it can you do

504
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,460
that also when that restriction is

505
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,560
lifted so it's been investigated and we

506
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,680
actually the company says no no we have

507
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,720
a right to to processes data you have to

508
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,550
then tell the data side back again that

509
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,110
you're starting to process it how does

510
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:21,580
that work does it come into exception

511
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:23,979
reports right think about that next one

512
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,300
data portability sorry about the

513
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,600
whirling this is actually from

514
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,520
that's illegal act but the best way to

515
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,929
describe this and this is probably the

516
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,580
easiest one that you didn't know you

517
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,030
were doing see you will read doing

518
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,750
something that complies with gdpr hey

519
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:42,040
when you open a new bank account

520
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:43,570
nowadays you don't you just say Oh got a

521
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,310
new bank account can you speak to my old

522
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,909
bank and just get all my seven orders

523
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:51,790
and things moved across and they do that

524
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:53,650
automatically by magic I promise you

525
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,080
they're not sitting there and writing

526
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,240
down numbers and codes and things it's

527
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,100
probably a download for into CSV XML

528
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,780
something like that and it's an upload

529
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,669
on the other side and that's what this

530
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,530
basically is it says that when you move

531
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,540
to different provider you need to be

532
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,210
able to easily get your data in a

533
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,470
machine readable format and as I said

534
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,450
I'm pretty sure this is probably the

535
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:19,270
easiest thing you can do to be gdelt

536
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:27,670
compliance make it electronic yay next

537
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:29,980
we get to GDP our principles these are

538
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,660
all the GDP our principles and as before

539
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,250
I'm not going to talk about every single

540
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,310
one just the ones that I think are

541
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:38,200
really relevant to this audience so

542
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,970
there are those six principles and then

543
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,160
the accountability one which kind of

544
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,500
stands apart and the accountability

545
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,990
principle says that you must be able to

546
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,940
demonstrate for that you're doing the

547
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,710
six that come before and how do we

548
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,670
demonstrate stuff we have documentation

549
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:58,810
so what does that mean for me as a

550
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:00,490
developer keep documentation please tell

551
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:04,659
us what you're doing and why you're

552
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:06,940
doing it more importantly lawfulness

553
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,680
fairness and transparency we talked

554
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,680
about this a little bit before but every

555
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,860
time you get the piece of data a piece

556
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,810
of personal data you need to know what

557
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,550
you're collecting why you're collecting

558
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,560
it where is it going and where is it

559
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,360
stored

560
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,600
vice' is it stored just in this little

561
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,290
database over here what happens when you

562
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,689
pop that up

563
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,070
does that go to one place do you have

564
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,500
multiple backups do you have multiple

565
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,030
backups in different places because

566
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,800
that's still the data it's not just

567
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,410
about the main database it's about all

568
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,770
of these things where is it where is it

569
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,070
going

570
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:45,100
who

571
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:47,500
ascender - you need two notes you need

572
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,780
to ask those questions of the people you

573
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,030
know your privacy experts but from a

574
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,139
technical architecture point of view you

575
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,240
should be able to answer this question

576
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:59,560
especially the bottom - where is it

577
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,000
going and where is it stored purpose

578
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,560
limitation this is an interesting one

579
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,170
interesting challenge I think for

580
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,750
developers out there personal data can

581
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:11,350
only be used for the purpose for which

582
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:14,110
it was collected and actually I want you

583
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,570
to think back to the last time you read

584
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,030
a privacy notice it probably said

585
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,399
something along the lines of we are

586
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:24,000
collecting the personal data we need to

587
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,980
collect in order to fulfill the business

588
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,230
objectives that we will define at some

589
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,910
point whenever we feel like it and we

590
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,150
will be keeping that for as long as we

591
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,150
need to

592
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,080
so the gdpr says you need to say all of

593
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,050
those things but it actually asks you to

594
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,230
be specific collecting data for business

595
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:46,870
purposes it doesn't tell me why you're

596
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,510
needing it so you need to be specific

597
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,000
and then once you are specific about it

598
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:53,680
you can only use it for that purpose

599
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,420
you're not allowed to use them in for a

600
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,800
different purpose

601
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,020
so if someone comes to you in the

602
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,190
developer and they say oh you've got

603
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,450
this data in this table

604
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,650
I'll just want to connect this on the

605
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,630
system into it because we want these

606
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,340
reports to go here and there we then

607
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:09,100
going to sell it on to this person so on

608
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,669
the challenge for you is hold on a

609
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,310
moment

610
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:19,570
am I allowed to do that and have you

611
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:21,970
talked to the privacy team the next

612
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:25,149
principle in gdpr

613
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,410
is actually called data minimization and

614
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,260
I've put it in different words because

615
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:31,270
you remember I told you sometimes I say

616
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,140
thing and you hear another thing words

617
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,810
mean different things to different

618
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,670
people but what they mean by data

619
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,100
minimization is that you need to collect

620
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,980
the minimum data that's necessary for

621
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,879
that purpose which we've just defined so

622
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,070
if you're using a library or a template

623
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,720
go through it don't just say oh well

624
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,309
yeah yeah I got this from the mate of

625
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,350
mine or someone's already done some

626
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:55,019
the work this is a similar application

627
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,178
I'm just gonna use all of these fields

628
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:01,419
you have to ask the question do we need

629
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:05,019
all of that data my golden rule is if

630
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:06,159
you don't have it you can't lose it and

631
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:08,679
that's what makes it really important

632
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,529
and help security if you just don't

633
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:17,590
collect too much data just use what you

634
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:19,539
need collect what you need accuracy so

635
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,158
this comes back we've already talked

636
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:23,710
about stuff must be able to be updated

637
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,320
to be rectified and things should also

638
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,299
be accurate so I've got an example that

639
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,039
happened to me so I've got a bit of a

640
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,019
funny surname well it's not funny to me

641
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,259
it's just funny in this context in the

642
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:37,539
UK it's two words of space in the middle

643
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:39,820
with one is a small letter and one's a

644
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:41,649
capital letter and this is not the only

645
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,840
system that I try to register that says

646
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:46,539
you're not using a proper surname like

647
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,070
excuse me mate that is my surname that's

648
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:49,690
the way that that's the correct way to

649
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,389
spell it

650
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,639
we're implementation just says sorry

651
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:58,959
your surname is wrong I know it's all

652
00:26:54,639 --> 00:27:01,178
wrong your bias in developing is wrong

653
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,740
but that's awkward different topic for a

654
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:05,759
different talk you know my daughter

655
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:08,999
surname is three words or two spaces and

656
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:12,840
different capitals and non capitals

657
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:14,919
right so don't do this just make things

658
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:20,439
usable and make sure that you can

659
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:22,119
accurately reflect data storage

660
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,740
limitation again I thought use that

661
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,879
words on the slide because it means

662
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,419
different things when you're talking to

663
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:29,350
technical people these DDP are and I've

664
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:31,869
talked about this one I mentioned

665
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,639
privacy notice says only keep data for

666
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:38,860
as long as necessary now as long as

667
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:41,408
necessary is not a time frame this is

668
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:44,139
why DPR is lovely because they're made

669
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:46,659
like risk-based thing you define what is

670
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:48,490
necessary but that's the thing you need

671
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:51,399
to actually define it someone has to

672
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,769
tell you how long that is necessary is

673
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:55,449
not a time frame it's got to be two

674
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:56,350
months three months five years six years

675
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,929
ten years

676
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,309
someone has to tell you what that is and

677
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:06,460
you've got to make them tell you please

678
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:08,019
do so when you design in your system do

679
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,429
you put in some I don't know automates a

680
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,500
deletion script of some achieve that

681
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:13,419
effect this says this data we only need

682
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,429
for six months there are further they'll

683
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:17,889
be deleted what is that do teal system

684
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:19,029
what does that do to your logs you know

685
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:21,399
can we delete that without breaking

686
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:23,259
application can we change that time

687
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:25,178
frame you know if we review this in a

688
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:26,980
year's time if they're actually we now

689
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:30,070
need it 23 months or maybe a bit longer

690
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:34,379
can you change that think about that

691
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,379
when you're developing your system

692
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:40,479
integrity and confidentiality so this is

693
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,080
the only little bit that talks about

694
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,649
security in GDL

695
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:50,350
basically it says don't lose stuff but

696
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:51,850
if so the actual word says you need to

697
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,009
use the proprietary code and

698
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:56,559
organizational methods to protect the

699
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:58,240
data that you're keeping it does not

700
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,139
define what appropriate technical

701
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,259
organizational methods is unfortunately

702
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:08,008
it does say use examples gdpr says for

703
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:12,850
example encryption for example

704
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:14,620
serialization for example they use these

705
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,029
things it doesn't mean everything has to

706
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,518
be encrypted you need to look at your

707
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,929
system what data are you keeping how

708
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,179
much of it are you keeping where are you

709
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:24,340
keeping it is it MacLeod is it in a

710
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:25,600
public facing system because yeah then I

711
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,789
would suggest you probably need to

712
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,459
encrypt that is it I mean the internal

713
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,440
system is it you know behind various

714
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,679
other things I don't know I don't

715
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,389
understand your system you need to you

716
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,539
know as I said do a risk assessment

717
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:42,070
what is your threat model how can people

718
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:45,309
get into the data how do I keep it

719
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:48,189
secure please do document what you're

720
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:52,029
doing because that again be useful to to

721
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,620
show gdpr compliance but more like if

722
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:55,539
there's a breach so be you can go back

723
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,979
and say well we made this decision we

724
00:29:55,539 --> 00:30:04,360
design it this way because of

725
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:05,620
such-and-such a reason what else can I

726
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,939
do

727
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:12,729
so this again as a developer the main

728
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,080
thing is maybe that a 23 year old why

729
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,330
why I'm doing this

730
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,250
can we do that why are we doing that why

731
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,529
do we need all of this data why are we

732
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,320
collecting it why are we keeping it why

733
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:24,580
are we keeping it for 10 years

734
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,840
ask those questions and make people

735
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,110
actually answer them and if they don't

736
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,090
just documents it anyway when there's

737
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,158
personal data involved please involve

738
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:35,260
your privacy team and I'm going to

739
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,870
emphasize this again security people

740
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,049
aren't privacy experts privacy experts

741
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,639
on security experts so you know when

742
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,129
we're in a situation where we say oh

743
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,080
projects just gone live but I really

744
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,340
wish they'd talk to the security team in

745
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,559
the beginning and I could have helped

746
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,720
them the privacy people feel exactly the

747
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,100
same way so when you're developing a new

748
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,799
system and there's any sort of personal

749
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,658
data involved make sure you involve the

750
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,860
DPO or someone's with some privacy

751
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:04,690
privacy experience right from the start

752
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,879
remember that gdpr stairs privacy by

753
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:09,130
designer by default but make sure you

754
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,380
get those things in from the start it's

755
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:14,649
much easier to do that than to try and

756
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,289
fix things later on keep your wiki's and

757
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:19,299
documentation is up to date we all love

758
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:23,140
doing it but it's really really very

759
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:26,049
helpful to define define all of those

760
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,940
things purposes how long we're keeping

761
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,789
data for at the time that it was

762
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,200
discussed because that also happens to

763
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,640
years down the line you're like oh why

764
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,159
are we keeping this data for 10 years

765
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,620
no one knows because someone came up

766
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,700
with a random number at some point

767
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,449
document those decisions as you keep

768
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,059
going through the design process and as

769
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,779
I just said with the previous point a

770
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,279
general description of the security

771
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,409
measures and the risk assessment that's

772
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:55,779
helped you get there is really really

773
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:58,630
useful so in summary we see is not

774
00:31:55,779 --> 00:32:02,110
security when personal data vault called

775
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,039
the privacy team make sure those

776
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,719
questions are answered

777
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,110
what are we collecting why we're

778
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,360
collecting it how long do we need at all

779
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:13,059
make sure you can update stuff think

780
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,678
about those situations where you need to

781
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:16,120
update things or delete things and what

782
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,700
that does to your system hopefully it

783
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,760
doesn't break it the documentation is

784
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,370
important

785
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,550
most importantly if you're not sure ask

786
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,929
I really think I hope that this talk has

787
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,300
given you some information some

788
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:31,400
ammunition to go and ask the questions

789
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,629
that need to be answered and make sure

790
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:37,130
that you then speak to the right people

791
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:40,670
and involve them in your projects that's

792
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,510
it for me I'm happy to take questions if

793
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,820
I can't answer them

794
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:48,910
I promise go away and find the answers

795
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,909
[Music]

796
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:01,369
[Music]

797
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,499
[Music]

798
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:44,480
and see the questions being asked

799
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:49,429
definitely the answers I'm not so sure

800
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:51,380
about that because you know if those

801
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,300
questions so it comes back about

802
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,220
understanding what you're doing and yes

803
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,190
you might not know the algorithm in

804
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,600
detail but cuz it's right at the start

805
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,650
about what data you're collecting and

806
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,939
what's the purpose you're collecting it

807
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,590
for if you're actually putting there

808
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,800
well the purpose is to improve our

809
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:09,440
systems or to teach our machine learning

810
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:13,239
singing you know at least you've been

811
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,240
clear about that from the very beginning

812
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:20,720
then you also need to consider that that

813
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:22,549
mightier Asia is as I said luckily not

814
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,839
all data can be raised but it's

815
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,010
definitely something to think about if

816
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,720
someone who says actually I want you to

817
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:29,780
stop processing my date I want you to

818
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,469
stop doing that can you just stop can

819
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,590
you take that away

820
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:38,609
and can you remove it from the system

821
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:40,830
probably not so as I said the answers

822
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:43,049
aren't really there but definitely the

823
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,848
questions are being answered and with

824
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,830
all of these things you need all of

825
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,300
those experience in the same room right

826
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,889
you need the privacy people who can

827
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,649
actually interpret the role you need the

828
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,179
developers who can actually hopefully

829
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:57,540
explain to you what they're doing how

830
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,920
that works I mean all these talk around

831
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,529
to make sure we're doing the right thing

832
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,480
and yes testing systems is a very

833
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,940
interesting dynamic

834
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,130
he's never I read a Provost privacy

835
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,170
statement it says we're going to use

836
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:13,320
your data and up allow testing systems

837
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:18,060
as well but in some places is absolutely

838
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:20,490
needed documentation is my best advice

839
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,040
all of that just document when you've

840
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:25,020
had a discussion and what the results

841
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,980
were because as I said dude car doesn't

842
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,270
say you can't do it

843
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,830
it just says you need to make a

844
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:39,050
risk-based decision so once you've

845
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:41,369
documented that that should help great

846
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,990
well I hope you found that useful and

847
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:44,310
welcome to talk to you afterwards and

848
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,660
you've got some time for maybe a quick

849
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,660
cup of coffee before we finished today
