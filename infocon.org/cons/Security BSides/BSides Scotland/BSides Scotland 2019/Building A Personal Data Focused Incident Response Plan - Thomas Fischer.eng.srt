1
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:12,190
so good morning we're here this morning

2
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:14,379
well I'm going to present kind of like a

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,230
follow-up subject to Akeno this morning

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,210
which is all about instant response and

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:23,279
the best the therefore was also

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:26,050
mentioned instant response last year I

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,029
started working with a bunch of kings

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:33,070
because it was like you know one hour to

9
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:35,020
midnight and most of the security teams

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,780
didn't know what the Frank they were

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,440
doing about insert response or just

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,420
general security in the face of gdpr

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,339
it was incredible to actually see how

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,280
many security teams actually didn't have

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,280
a focus on what activities they actually

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,010
needed to do in light of the upcoming

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,289
GDP our most of that was because a lot

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,879
of companies and you know petróleos

19
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,350
raise your hands if you're in that

20
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,419
situation if you were in that situation

21
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,340
is they took the whole exercise as a

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,509
compliance exercise so they had a bunch

23
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,979
of really high paid consultants that

24
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:07,780
came in and reviewed all their processes

25
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:09,610
and procedures but they didn't actually

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,330
think about the actual implications of

27
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:18,060
what could go wrong and how to manage an

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,060
incident so does that sound familiar

29
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:27,789
the last have it so Who am I come on

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,390
wake up hmm okay what's it the

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,079
old-fashioned way

32
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,600
so my enormous I've been doing security

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,548
for Foley over 25 years I've been in the

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,740
computer science industry for a lot

35
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:42,729
longer than that one of the things that

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:45,009
I've had is I've been in NGOs

37
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:47,140
organizations part of these two Response

38
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:49,689
Teams a part of architecture teams and

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,299
I've also been in from consulting into

40
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:58,149
software into the software development

41
00:01:52,299 --> 00:02:02,649
cycle as well in product vendors so I

42
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:04,780
haven't really poor vision but why true

43
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,790
love really is Incident Response and

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,860
just to posit the processes around its

45
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,470
procedures around its with response I'm

46
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,610
also the director pea-sized London and I

47
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,520
also I am on

48
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,890
the board of the IDSA UK if you want to

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,630
know about the air EE say UK just come

50
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:26,859
find me nah I'll give you a quick chat

51
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:30,370
about it so as you know last year we saw

52
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,160
the official start date of the GDP our

53
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,300
butt GPR isn't the only personal data

54
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,100
focused law or legislation but you might

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,900
have felt a face you know there are

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,269
others but are therefore as weak and

57
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,280
there are others that are coming up one

58
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,450
of the toughest is after the GPR is

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,580
probably the Turkish personal dating

60
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,380
Protection Law where you know the CEO

61
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,750
can actually go to jail if there's if

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,160
there's a personal data breach

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,560
there's also got we've also got roadmap

64
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,120
legislation I mean Canada's implementing

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,950
one Japan's implementing one South

66
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,989
Korea's implementing one if you actually

67
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,820
follow the EU trade regular trade

68
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,170
agreements that are coming up you'll

69
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,730
probably see what the countries the

70
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,200
countries where we get where they use

71
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,000
them to have trade agreements with are

72
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,290
actually implementing personal data laws

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,799
it's really strange I wonder why anyway

74
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,750
so with this talk I'm going to focus

75
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,580
some of the things on GDP on it's just

76
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,930
because it's easier to talk about GDP

77
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,400
are because everybody kind of knows

78
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,930
about it and everybody's heard about it

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,680
right if I start talking about the

80
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,660
Turkish legislation you've got one right

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:37,390
so with focus on most of the aspects

82
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:40,060
around GDP on so now one of the things

83
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,649
that each start with is how is your

84
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,630
instant response process what is it

85
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,910
based on so if you give I have three

86
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:51,880
examples here right so the one on them

87
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:53,829
on the left is the GDP our work the ir

88
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,420
process workflow that science teaches

89
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,400
you right so it's preparation

90
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,190
identification containment medication

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,540
recovery lessons learned it's a very

92
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:06,280
simple one it's six steps but I found

93
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,810
that in most cases less and less gets

94
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,160
dropped because you never have time

95
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,920
because you're fighting fires with a

96
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,220
number five how many of you think that's

97
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,640
true

98
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,250
just out of curiosity quite a few right

99
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,039
so the out the one on the right is

100
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,450
actually very similar except it's got a

101
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:27,789
few extra steps towards the

102
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:29,740
that is actually the nist process so

103
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,440
what they've done is they've actually

104
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,960
added lessons learned is actually become

105
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,250
review and communications right so

106
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,750
there's there's a little bit it's a

107
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,110
little bit more detailed in the types of

108
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,700
process steps well what in the middle

109
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,780
how many of you have seen the one in the

110
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,670
middle before I've heard of the one in

111
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,280
the middle

112
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:50,670
whew so the older loom is basically a

113
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,830
military tactic it was developed by

114
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,180
Lieutenant chroma on the US Air Force

115
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,760
essentially the position is is that

116
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,840
you're continuously in a state of alert

117
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,460
alert so how do you manage that state of

118
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,789
alert and to be able to respond to

119
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,739
something the the concept is is that you

120
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,780
observe your environment to understand

121
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,490
the environment then you orient your

122
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,770
thinking or you orient your detections

123
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,270
towards what's important to you if

124
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,099
something happens you decide what

125
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,770
actions you're going to take until and

126
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,870
then you act right it's very similar for

127
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,250
the two to a standard I our workflow

128
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,920
except it's a lot more dynamic it's a

129
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,560
lot more it's a lot faster you'll see

130
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,740
this in mature organizations mostly the

131
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,630
ones that are going from traditional IR

132
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,240
and traditional detection more into the

133
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,290
threat hunting space and not what some

134
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,550
vendors are calling a threat hunting

135
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,500
today which is a bit socially just die

136
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,000
off but or detections

137
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,650
but real threat hunting where you're

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,630
going through look you're going through

139
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,070
information and to try to try and find

140
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,750
something that you're not dick you know

141
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,900
you're notables really tensions don't

142
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,690
pick up I'm actually going to focus on

143
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,830
the sand one only because I'm partial to

144
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,900
sands I don't think it's a good

145
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,520
organization they teach very well and

146
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,310
they've got they've got good curriculums

147
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,310
and it's it's a little bit it's more

148
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:10,090
contextual to for a lot of people but

149
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,800
the principles always the same so when

150
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,719
you're actually going to start looking

151
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,060
at with rebuilding your il process to

152
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,140
focus on personal data you need to start

153
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,870
the first thing you need to do is

154
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,909
understand what a data breach really

155
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,530
means and and what are the conditions

156
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,080
under which data breach is going to

157
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,789
affect you so at that point you first

158
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,109
need to understand some of the

159
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,720
legislation you need to understand

160
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,280
what's behind the legislation now most

161
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,790
of times what I do is I recommend you

162
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,989
work with your legal team or you

163
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,400
you know compliance didn't because

164
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:42,080
they've gone through this they try to

165
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:45,320
understand it trust me you won't get a a

166
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,880
concrete answer I've been with a number

167
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,890
of organizations I've talked to a number

168
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,300
of organizations each legal team has a

169
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,539
different perspective on what you need

170
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,740
to do which is really confusing but from

171
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,120
your organization's point of view the

172
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,600
best is to work with the people that

173
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,310
know how your organization's face is to

174
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,110
try to understand personal data breaches

175
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,880
so you go with your legal teams

176
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:09,320
decisions if I take a look at the GPR

177
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,810
these are the five points that are most

178
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,650
important when you're looking at

179
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,140
understanding how it's going to affect

180
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:18,500
you into a response process of course a

181
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:22,490
key one of the seventh to our report to

182
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,140
the DPA so how many of you yeah if do

183
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,440
you think your IR process where your IR

184
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,659
teams are able to actually notify in 72

185
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,960
hours how many do you think that that's

186
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,940
possible current or you're not sure you

187
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,530
know it's there's a few of you put your

188
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,380
hands up so you've actually looked into

189
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,419
this right the a lot of organizations

190
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,100
just don't understand what 72 hours

191
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,490
actually means in terms of what you need

192
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,680
to report yeah because the second line

193
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,810
is become aware of the breach what does

194
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,240
actually lean write a lot of there's a

195
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,950
lot of definitions about that but the

196
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,540
key concept is is that once you know

197
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,820
there's potentially a data breach you

198
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,050
need to report that I'm going to skip

199
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,200
the middle one because I'm going to come

200
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,540
back to it later the fourth one is

201
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,099
really important and this is the hardest

202
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,130
one to understand from the perspective

203
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,600
of security is unless unlikely to result

204
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,340
in risk to rights and freedoms of

205
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,920
persons right what the hell does that

206
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,650
mean I mean it's really yeah if you

207
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,600
break it down it's essentially what

208
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,429
they're talking about is if the personal

209
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,010
data gets leaked is it going to harm

210
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,570
that person and harm that person can

211
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,030
meet a whole bunch of things that can be

212
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,610
physical or it can be financial or it

213
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,270
could just be emotional right it could

214
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:38,930
be just emotional trauma there is no

215
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:41,689
clear definition around this right so if

216
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:45,229
you leak a bunch of email addresses is

217
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,760
that really going to harm somebody how

218
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,080
do you define that and

219
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,880
you really won't know this until

220
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,650
somebody actually challenges this and it

221
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,310
goes all the way to the European Court

222
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,410
of Justice right so what you need to do

223
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,569
is basically assume that anything that

224
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:05,990
you think is potentially harmful to a

225
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:07,250
person needs to be notified and then you

226
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,870
especially if you're dealing with

227
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,180
personal data so like if you're the

228
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,670
financial institution or if you're if

229
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,439
you have a whole customer list that gets

230
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,589
late you're going to have to notify the

231
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,940
data subject and how that's not really

232
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,440
the responsibility other than so

233
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,150
response team but you need to provide

234
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,550
correct information to your

235
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,620
communications or to your dpo so that

236
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,430
they can actually do the verification

237
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:35,570
and correct in proper manner so this

238
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:38,959
next step really is to understand what

239
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,190
the hell is personal data right there's

240
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,540
a lot of discussions around what

241
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,100
personal data is or isn't if you look at

242
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,890
where it's that it's been defined in the

243
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,600
GPR it's actually quite precise right

244
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,750
there's a lot of really good information

245
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,480
energy DPR now one of the things that

246
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,100
unit on but there's two aspects to it is

247
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,900
that you have the article which talks

248
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,640
about personal data but the actual

249
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,650
definition of personal data is in the

250
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,960
recitals so you need to go back from the

251
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,370
article into the recitals and as you can

252
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,950
see there's a lot of recitals to

253
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,390
understand that just gives you a little

254
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,820
bit of details on what gets classified

255
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,439
as personal data but the important thing

256
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,930
is to understand that it's any

257
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,390
information relating to an identified or

258
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,339
identifiable natural person so an

259
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:25,760
organization won't fall under this or a

260
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,260
company won't fall that is a user in a

261
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,230
company crew floor under this because

262
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,060
it's a natural person identified or

263
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,180
identifiable means that you can correct

264
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,839
directly pickup that person or you can

265
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,790
use the information to identify them and

266
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,290
the key concept behind that is the last

267
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,469
line which is directly or indirectly

268
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,290
right if I have enough information to be

269
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:51,380
able to go back and figure out who you

270
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,060
are even if it's not personally

271
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,750
highlight able let's say you get a

272
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,209
password leak for example right

273
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,220
and the user uses information in the

274
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,890
password say like a place of birth a

275
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,250
date of birth and potentially an email

276
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:07,080
address associated to it it might not be

277
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,470
the actual person's name and you know

278
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,450
proper name but because I'm also

279
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,250
impacted by indirectly if I can use that

280
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,540
information to actually identify unique

281
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:20,700
individual it falls under the GDP are

282
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,069
now for an inter response team that's

283
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,240
really important because not only do you

284
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,680
need to understand what data's being

285
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,930
leaked but you need to understand how

286
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,459
the data can be used so when you're

287
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,780
looking at password Li you need to go

288
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,240
back and look at the passwords and say

289
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,939
hey wait a second this password I can

290
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,600
identify this one UPD individual that

291
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,540
becomes a personal data breach

292
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,860
alright and that's kind of stuff that

293
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,959
you don't get out of it from a

294
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,940
compliance exercise so what is personal

295
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,820
data if you take a look at the vendor

296
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,220
space they talk about PII most of PII is

297
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,190
these very simple pieces of information

298
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,300
right all around identifying a person so

299
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:02,250
maintain birth gender maybe a dresses

300
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,520
maybe columns maybe you know credit card

301
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,610
numbers simple things but if you

302
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,310
actually look at the definition and how

303
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:15,150
you can directly or indirectly identify

304
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:17,459
somebody this isn't enough it's a lot

305
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,589
more complex it boils down to a lot more

306
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,880
information so I'm not going to I mean

307
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,020
I'm not going to go through these but

308
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,100
I'll leave it up for a second

309
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,860
it's you're going from anything that's

310
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,839
related to your job to anything in your

311
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,490
mobile devices to anything that's

312
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,560
related to your health to anything

313
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,080
that's related to your IT devices or you

314
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,020
know to a computer so your broadband

315
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:45,240
connection I Oh tea fits into this now

316
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:48,050
as well right Alexa for example your

317
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,390
financial status credit card readings

318
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:54,930
transactions mortgages loans income tax

319
00:12:51,390 --> 00:13:01,520
and anything related to your movements

320
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:04,410
right to your car to your tube access I

321
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,590
laugh because a number of years ago or

322
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,290
actually party

323
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,750
Africa so it was right before the Saudi

324
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,719
PR I used to work in the bank area in

325
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,790
London so I get on the tube and one

326
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,500
afternoon I'm like walking down this

327
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,939
year waiting because it's really busy so

328
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,190
I'm waiting in line to get onto the tube

329
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,530
and I see the slide at the entry we are

330
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,190
currently testing a solution that tracks

331
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:31,920
your phone and using your Bluetooth

332
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:33,730
phone your Wi-Fi I'm like mm-hmm okay

333
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,490
this is interesting

334
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,770
where's the GDP I noticed for this kind

335
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,800
of thing what are you going to do it the

336
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,540
data so I funnily enough a couple years

337
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,240
before I had actually been on a project

338
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,480
and worked with an architect a big data

339
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,880
architect who's working with TfL and

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,280
they were working on plans to basically

341
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,200
track movements of people for one good

342
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,610
reason they wanted to track the movement

343
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,320
of people in stations so that they could

344
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,050
regulate flow and they could understand

345
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,000
when peak hours are but subsequently

346
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,319
they looked at it and they said oh wait

347
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,630
a minute we could do something like

348
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,220
Minority Report so when people come into

349
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,820
this tube and they're going down the

350
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,320
escalator

351
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,310
we could put targeted ads on the thing

352
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,370
and we'll get more money from the

353
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:22,900
targeted ads like no you can't do that

354
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:25,270
no sorry this all of that falls under

355
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,800
personal data I mean you can do it right

356
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,449
there's nothing there's not really

357
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,890
anything of GPR stopping isn't doing it

358
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,930
it's just you need to understand how

359
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,100
that falls into personal data and what

360
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:37,479
would happen if there was a personal

361
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,250
data breach so I start to break this

362
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,570
down into more technical terms and I

363
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,060
started to make lists and I gave up

364
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,250
because I basically this is just a

365
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,510
subset of what came out of it the really

366
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,700
important thing is that like when you

367
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,720
look at things like physical appearance

368
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,430
right there's all of these different

369
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,180
types of physical appearances that you

370
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:57,030
could track there's the yellow part is

371
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,979
even worse because the yellow part is is

372
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,420
what GTR considers sensitive data I

373
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,920
haven't gone like you know I'm not going

374
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,170
to dwell on sensitive data but

375
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,370
essentially sensitive data is Dana but

376
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,740
technically you're not allowed to

377
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,090
collect under the GDP unless you're

378
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,070
special permission

379
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,590
and it's all about Union memberships

380
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:18,970
race religion and things like that

381
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:21,760
very but the problem is you know it's on

382
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,850
the topic foot country-specific right

383
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,760
why country-specific well think about

384
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:31,930
the EU right it's 27 nations right now

385
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,970
right how many of them are all ask us

386
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:38,170
you know like latin-based half maybe

387
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,660
once you start going towards the east

388
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,339
you start to introduce new character

389
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,600
sets you start to interview Cyrillic

390
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,760
type character sets you start to

391
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,010
introduce different naming conventions

392
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,870
you start to introduce a whole bunch of

393
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:54,069
things so not only do you need to track

394
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:55,960
this in say English for the UK but you

395
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,210
also need to track it in order in all

396
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,480
the other languages as well right

397
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,920
and all your potential other character

398
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,390
sets

399
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:11,339
so you're complicating your task even

400
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:14,740
more so data breaches

401
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,360
what do you consider data breach or how

402
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,370
do you handle it well the first thing

403
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,710
you do is it's like where am I going to

404
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,130
actually focus my attention in insert

405
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:29,800
response does anybody want take a while

406
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:31,600
guess so you cannot focus your

407
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,660
activities around preparation and

408
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,820
identification preparation you need to

409
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,660
understand where everything is you need

410
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,250
to build up data asset management of all

411
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,069
the personal data that you potentially

412
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,790
storing or holding or processing

413
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,100
identification is when you're actually

414
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,610
going to detect something and take it

415
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,870
take it

416
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:57,880
oh I action against including their

417
00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:02,020
education so innovator how you predict

418
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:06,040
that the procedure this is a workflow

419
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:09,010
that actually it's a base workflow for

420
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,530
any zone that are documented and

421
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:16,119
released right before you know a few

422
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:18,579
years ago so the first step of course is

423
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,379
preparation right so we understand

424
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,359
preparation you're gonna actually going

425
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,890
to do an activity around preparing user

426
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,928
response process you're going to look at

427
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,790
where is where is your personal data the

428
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:32,049
important part is actually when you get

429
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,809
to event handling right so when you get

430
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:37,710
through that you get an event detection

431
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:40,299
okay you do your initial assessment and

432
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,880
you're going to want to understand his

433
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,500
personal data involved if it's not then

434
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,920
you just carry on your you're your own

435
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,200
issue standard workflow if it is that's

436
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,670
when things start to get complicated so

437
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,840
the first thing you're going to do is

438
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,610
you're actually going to have to notify

439
00:17:52,840 --> 00:18:00,850
your DPA to let them know that this

440
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,709
personal data involved if the personal

441
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,959
data it could be judgmental for the user

442
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,090
you're going to have to also notify the

443
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,940
user now of course the IR team isn't

444
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,770
going to do a notification but the IR

445
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,419
team needs to understand the impact of

446
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,860
that personal data so that they can

447
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:17,049
actually get the bright people into the

448
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,750
room and actually you know get the right

449
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:22,120
notifications to be sent out the

450
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,250
important part is understanding you know

451
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,320
what is compromising this event is it a

452
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,750
breach what are the circumstances what's

453
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,178
the severity of the breach and do you

454
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,150
need an illiberal response or not now I

455
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:36,580
skipped ahead a bit but the 72-hour

456
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,010
portion what you need to do in this is a

457
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,280
response process is highlighted in that

458
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:47,440
box right so it's just that phase so if

459
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:49,750
you have a the ability to quickly assess

460
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,950
whether personal data is in play that's

461
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,230
where you're going to get your 72-hour

462
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,480
notification in play you don't need to

463
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,160
do a detail notification in that 72

464
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,380
hours you just need to issue a

465
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,270
notification saying we have a potential

466
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,470
data personal data breach we think

467
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:07,650
there's X amount of Records involved

468
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:12,000
and we're investigating you file that

469
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,620
with the ICO and you carry on your

470
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,360
investigation so you carry out you go

471
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,100
into your further assessment and that's

472
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,139
where you actually go into detail all of

473
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,280
your all of the evidence and you're

474
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,780
going to gather all the evidence and you

475
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,428
could look at how many potential

476
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,980
personal data records are in play and

477
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:28,830
then you do a detail notification sorted

478
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:33,210
into the DPA all right so the ICO in the

479
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:35,100
UK once you've done that you're going to

480
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,169
vacate containment recovery and the

481
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,639
important thing is you need to do you

482
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:40,440
need to keep the data breach inventory

483
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,750
you need to be able to actually

484
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,789
historically capture what happened when

485
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,730
it happened what was involved because if

486
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:49,740
let's say you do a notification you work

487
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,140
through it and you realize okay this

488
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,929
isn't really detrimental to user but a

489
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,700
year a year later you find out more

490
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:58,470
informations been leaked and that

491
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,669
somebody comes starts to complain you

492
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,730
need to be able to demonstrate with you

493
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:05,700
actually what you knew and what time and

494
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,409
what to what extent the bank you're

495
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,299
going through your lessons learn which

496
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:11,490
most people never really do properly and

497
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,470
you go back to your preparation phases

498
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:22,409
fine-tune your find through your process

499
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:25,080
so what qualifies as a breach right so

500
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,710
when is a breach not a beach so would

501
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,120
you all agree that exfiltration is rich

502
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,830
you're all character doing that I mean

503
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,129
that's the standard one data's being

504
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,199
leaked this a breach right destruction

505
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,080
how many of monitoring for destruction

506
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,809
and notifying based in destruction this

507
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,629
morning Todd Aquino he talked about one

508
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:48,260
a crying companies not notifying but

509
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,730
they've been hit by by ransomware

510
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,860
technically if that ransomware touches

511
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,350
personal data it's a violation of the

512
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,939
GDP are and you have to notify so

513
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,299
companies about notifying when they get

514
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,090
ransomware but potentially in in breach

515
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,610
of the geo of the GPR for example it's

516
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,899
like that's what I laugh when I saw

517
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,219
articles from newspapers and for vendors

518
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,799
saying that the next big risk of

519
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,380
personal data is is pump is a malicious

520
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,760
actor malicious actors ransoming the you

521
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,710
know access to the personal various we

522
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,520
don't get of GDP are fine the problem is

523
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,750
is they've touched

524
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,560
some data they've seen the poster there

525
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:27,210
so it's a violation of the GPR whether

526
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:29,190
you pay in the run-up right what about

527
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,020
alteration how many of you monitoring

528
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,930
for alteration right GPR says the

529
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,670
personal data should only be modified by

530
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,340
upon request immediate daily of subject

531
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:46,860
or within the proper limitations of your

532
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:48,780
privacy policy what about unauthorized

533
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,760
disclosure there you gotta tell me Oh an

534
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,440
officer I suppose X alteration there's a

535
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,620
slight different unauthorized disclosure

536
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,990
is when somebody for example if you

537
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,060
attach a credit card there so you sent

538
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,860
email out by accident right there's

539
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,889
difference between an exfiltration and

540
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,550
I'm actually like something but that's

541
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,500
unauthorized because it's a mistake or

542
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,379
because it's not really nice it's not

543
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,500
really taught you at Orion attack time

544
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,600
thing and the final one which gets

545
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,830
everybody unauthorized access how many

546
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,969
people monitoring for the unauthorized

547
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:31,379
access in there is a response and you

548
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:36,090
know a couple maybe the problem is is

549
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,740
that what happens if let's say an admin

550
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,720
goes into an HR database he's not

551
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,540
allowed to go into that HR database and

552
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,180
he does select star from people that's

553
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,530
unauthorized access

554
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,940
there's not many companies are actually

555
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:52,230
looking for that and carrying an

556
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:56,010
incident based on that all right Big

557
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:58,140
Data projects that could potentially

558
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:02,720
stolen or froze access as well so

559
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:06,090
there's plenty of places within this

560
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,620
these aspects of the GPR is that I

561
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,120
missed it may in certain response

562
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,739
process because you don't think about it

563
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,360
from the instant response process you're

564
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,520
thinking exfiltration you're thinking

565
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,229
malicious actor taking my data and

566
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,790
leaking it out of my organization right

567
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,830
you're not thinking about some guy

568
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,830
coming in and leading your database

569
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,230
so preparation faith so how do you

570
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:31,480
prepare well the first part really

571
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,790
aspect really is to understand your

572
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,830
environment and exact your existing

573
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,810
models most most companies already have

574
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,040
it's a responsible they already had a

575
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,169
threat model they've threatened they've

576
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,030
they've identified them their gaps are

577
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,000
try to fix their gaps if identified

578
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:49,710
their weaknesses and put in controls in

579
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,490
place what you need to look at is we

580
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,140
evaluating all those controls and

581
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:57,340
looking at where personal data fits in

582
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,970
and you're assigned personal data

583
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,139
attributes to those controls so if you

584
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:07,240
say like have a control that's

585
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:08,650
monitoring an HR system that's automatic

586
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,330
you know that that's the obvious choice

587
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,640
of flagging it with personal data

588
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,500
attributes you don't go back and

589
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,680
identify the new risks right look at the

590
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,260
new risks now I like to use the DPA a

591
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,670
data protection impact assessment you

592
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,340
don't need to do one for every piece of

593
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,630
data according to the legislation but I

594
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,330
like to use it because it actually helps

595
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,520
you understand what the risks are around

596
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,870
personal data and how you behave and on

597
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,280
how you're going to impact how you're

598
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:37,090
going to determine the impact potential

599
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,480
impact and of course you need to think

600
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:43,149
about what you're doing and try to

601
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,250
identify and understand if this data

602
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,320
leaks will it harm the data subject I

603
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,920
know a lot of organizations by default

604
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,450
that you're safe

605
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,180
any personal day is involved they'll

606
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:55,780
notify but you don't necessarily need to

607
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:58,030
do that and that's where the that's

608
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,680
where this is a good understanding of

609
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:05,100
what person that is being kept where and

610
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,100
how it's being processed will help a lot

611
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,490
so this is this is a really good dpi or

612
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,399
workflow process is published by the

613
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:19,300
French DPA look at that keen deter in

614
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,830
English as well as French but it takes

615
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,970
you through the steps of what it kind of

616
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,570
need to do to do a data personal data

617
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,930
impact assessment

618
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,540
now I use this as kind of a key to

619
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,040
helping to help understand how teen has

620
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,260
been processed and where the controls

621
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,770
need to be so it's very interesting to

622
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:42,020
look at those key elements of where

623
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,790
things are stored how they're stored how

624
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,260
their process of it I can evaluate the

625
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,310
risks and then look at the controls and

626
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,629
the mitigations I need to be in place

627
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,220
they actually have they also actually

628
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,330
have a tool which you can it's an

629
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,380
open-source tool which you can use to

630
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:59,720
actually do the impact assessment the

631
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,530
other thing that I use which is really

632
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,410
handy is the actual is project from

633
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,940
Dennis cruiser and OAuth where they were

634
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,400
looking at creating what they call the

635
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:14,510
data flow mapping so the personal data

636
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,090
journey the concept is is that in most

637
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,410
cases IT teams don't really understand

638
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,929
what the application is doing or what

639
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:24,350
data they're managing so what they

640
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:26,090
wanted to do was actually look at how to

641
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,159
talk to talk with the business or how to

642
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:31,389
understand how data moves around and

643
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:35,080
what data is being processed this

644
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:38,180
personal data journey flow mapping

645
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,470
actually helps you do that and I've you

646
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,930
know I've talked to a lot of businesses

647
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,060
and shown them this and they understand

648
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,710
that this is really beneficial because

649
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,480
you can actually put things into

650
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,460
perspective when you're talking to

651
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,170
business people right also application

652
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,820
owners because a lot of times they don't

653
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,560
understand what I can what you know IT

654
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,750
control if I understand what security

655
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,940
control is so if you bring it back down

656
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,020
to the basics what you're doing is

657
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,940
you're actually speaking their language

658
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:06,290
of you get a better understanding of

659
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:09,850
where things lie the essential aspects

660
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:12,050
of it is you determine what data source

661
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:16,399
what the data source is so if you're a

662
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:18,200
controller or if you're a collector then

663
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,730
you look at the types of data subjects

664
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,930
which you are accessing the categories

665
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,970
of individuals then you look at the

666
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,590
personal data being collected then you

667
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,010
look at the what processing needs are

668
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,030
being fulfilled what's happening then

669
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,470
there's different aspects you're going

670
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,790
to look at the lawful processing you can

671
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,110
look at the data retention because

672
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,790
that's important as well to understand

673
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,469
how long they're supposed to be there or

674
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,149
not and get rid of

675
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,860
you're going to look at who you get who

676
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,600
you get said to if you have their

677
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,250
processors so that's going to have to

678
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,350
fall into your incident response plan to

679
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,610
understand potential data leaves coming

680
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,469
from them and how you're going to react

681
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,059
to those whether you're transferring

682
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,760
into a third party in the third in a

683
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:54,500
foot in a different nation and what

684
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,650
security have been played right because

685
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:01,070
you have to do the personal data data

686
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:03,049
security by design yeah so you're

687
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,030
looking at things like is everything be

688
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:11,120
encrypted on transit are you encrypting

689
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:14,149
a you know long track lots much for

690
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,739
change for what kind of security you

691
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,520
have a play what controls you have a

692
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,650
look at what the application security is

693
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,049
about how you're doing on identity and

694
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,330
authentication are using a multi-factor

695
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,870
of things like that one of the first

696
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:32,240
interesting finds that that was issued

697
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,709
along the GPR was by the frigid EPA

698
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,450
where they issued a fire to an

699
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:39,140
advertising company because they weren't

700
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:41,409
protecting passwords right the passwords

701
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,750
were stored in clear-text

702
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:46,010
funny laugh it was it was they actually

703
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,929
declared it to the pineal and they

704
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,520
include the clean found around said oh

705
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:52,429
this is a violation you're gonna have to

706
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,470
find you if you do it once you've done

707
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:55,909
it basically this is what it would look

708
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,559
like once you've gone through the

709
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,570
processes you've actually highlighted

710
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,030
you know the that you're a controller

711
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:05,500
for example this is an HR workflow maybe

712
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:08,059
you're looking at employees and

713
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,650
recruitment you're looking at the

714
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:12,950
contact details you have a personnel

715
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:15,260
file the lawfulness processing how long

716
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:19,159
you're retaining it where you're sending

717
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,450
it so HMRC bag maybe if your

718
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,039
international company you're storing it

719
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,450
both in the EU in the US what you're

720
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,299
using the cloud you store you in both a

721
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,980
year the US and what kind of protections

722
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:32,480
you have it on the on the existing link

723
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:34,539
on the data itself so this helps you put

724
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,980
context on where personal data is is

725
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:39,289
sitting and how it's being used which

726
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,370
will help you identify what controls you

727
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,850
need to put in place to actually do the

728
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,850
detection

729
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:48,260
understanding where data lives is one of

730
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,120
the hardest things you'll ever do as

731
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,200
part of the security because nobody

732
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,330
really knows where it is

733
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,720
so the first choice is to do any

734
00:29:53,330 --> 00:30:00,320
discovery right aspects so discovery

735
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,610
methods once you go past the talking to

736
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,649
people or try to understand where it

737
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,780
lives you have the possibility to do it

738
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,950
technically right that's free ways of

739
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,200
really doing it think of printing

740
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,700
patterns or reg X fingerprinting the

741
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,500
problem of that is what you need to know

742
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,820
what data you already have so that you

743
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,680
can create that fingerprint and you can

744
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,570
do a search for it pad is more of a

745
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,030
keyword search so you need to have

746
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,470
really well predefined keywords so it

747
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,570
works okay if you have fields and you

748
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,520
can identify the fields but in most

749
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:28,250
cases what your end up doing is you end

750
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,290
up doing readings if you follow me on

751
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,210
twitter you'll notice you'll see stuff

752
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,920
from time to time see that I just say

753
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,810
there's nothing like records right you

754
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,790
need to use variants understand reg

755
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,070
excellence there's nothing better right

756
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:46,100
everybody does ring it right everybody's

757
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:49,700
already know finding the data basically

758
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,800
you talk to they knows we've done this I

759
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,120
can't insist enough I'm talking to data

760
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,190
on this because they're really the ones

761
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,409
who understand the data you call your

762
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,360
environment you build the map so that

763
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,920
you can focus your detectives crawling

764
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,860
the environment you can either use

765
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,720
proprietary tools or you can try and do

766
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,629
it with poem or Python which have good

767
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:13,310
text manipulation manipulation languages

768
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:15,140
right so you need to find that data

769
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,030
right and build that map so that you can

770
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,580
understand where you're going to focus

771
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,980
your controls I know that I'm being very

772
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,120
repetitive but so I found this the only

773
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,230
way to get really get people to

774
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,260
understand that this is the most

775
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,240
important part of what you're doing here

776
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,100
are some of the examples of reg X's but

777
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,630
I'm trying to build a database it just

778
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,669
haven't been focused on it as much as I

779
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:38,660
like to if you have any input just feel

780
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:42,650
free to drop me a line or submit him to

781
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:44,540
mind github but I've got some UK example

782
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,360
reg X is I've got Greek reactors in the

783
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,800
middle some of them are repetitive so

784
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,290
I'd like a passport you could probably

785
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,180
repeat except that you have if you want

786
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,840
identified nationality from one identify

787
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,730
the country

788
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,290
you're probably going to put the freely

789
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,750
gonna have a free letter country code

790
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,460
either country code in the middle so you

791
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:06,500
so you'll probably end up building reg

792
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:11,090
axes for every country but how the hell

793
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,890
do you find this stuff right CCTV call

794
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,470
desks how many of you have call this

795
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:20,410
that record the record that do recording

796
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:23,330
for quality control that's personal data

797
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,700
right how do you put controls on this

798
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,820
stuff how do you actually find this

799
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,080
stuff in most cases pre well localized

800
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,300
right it's pretty well localized to a

801
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,100
system so you try safai and you put

802
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,600
protections around that system the

803
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,030
problem is sometimes it doesn't like

804
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,199
CCTV might actually be a third party

805
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,389
that's running it for you in their story

806
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,750
or somewhere else so there's a whole

807
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:47,120
bunch of extended aspects to looking at

808
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,830
this information response process but we

809
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,449
miss a lot of times right because we're

810
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,550
focused on the applications we're not

811
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,960
focused on where the data is actually

812
00:32:52,550 --> 00:33:00,050
coming from or where the data actually

813
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:02,630
resides what about this application logs

814
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:05,870
how many of you deal with developers at

815
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:11,450
your organization number how many

816
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:14,689
developers forget to turn off debug so

817
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:18,260
you got debug and you've you know print

818
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:21,890
tool to log user name password password

819
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:26,600
maybe not right username name date of

820
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:30,250
birth so tech to test that automatically

821
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,360
classifies those logs as personal data

822
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,730
and this is stuff you know you don't

823
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,320
think about right when you're doing

824
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,090
you're looking at you focused on the

825
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,590
application of the data that resides in

826
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,830
the application you're not thinking of

827
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,270
everything that's going on on the site

828
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:46,280
that's an important part and I keep you

829
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,139
know I've told a lot of people like have

830
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,190
you really thought about the extent of

831
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,570
the personal data that you're actually

832
00:33:49,190 --> 00:34:00,020
taking and the controls that you put

833
00:33:50,570 --> 00:34:00,870
into place so how do you identify what

834
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,090
you've done the prefer

835
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,100
we now have technically you have a

836
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,480
personal data asset manager asset

837
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,359
management system or you have an asset

838
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,099
database right of all the locational

839
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,389
you've got personal data which is very

840
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:15,200
useful because then you can actually use

841
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:17,250
that information to build controls

842
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,199
there's two ways to build controls you

843
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,960
can either do passive so that's goes

844
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,219
back to the data discovery or just

845
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,040
marrying with a discovery to your sock

846
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,899
in same activity or you can do an active

847
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,668
detection using an employ on network

848
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:35,399
with solutions but essentially the the

849
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:37,109
whole aspect of it is once you have run

850
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,259
your data discovery and you understand

851
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:42,359
you have your asset database you can

852
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,339
actually create a list of locations

853
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:47,009
where data resides what personal data

854
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:48,929
resides once you understand that you can

855
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:52,649
extract those personal data locations

856
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:55,710
however as paths or specific

857
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:57,990
applications or IP addresses or DNS you

858
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,670
know DNS names anything that will help

859
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,009
you identify where personal data lives

860
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:05,310
and you can feed those into endpoint or

861
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:06,839
network rules the idea being that you're

862
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,820
going to look at triggering or

863
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:11,520
generating an event for every time a

864
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,530
user accesses personal data once you've

865
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,910
done that you can basically trigger a

866
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,099
net when detectives and send them back

867
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,509
to your event database where you want to

868
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,240
turn console your sim whenever you're

869
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:23,609
using similarly once you once you have

870
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,979
those personal data locations you can

871
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:27,869
create look-up tables build focused

872
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,310
queries within your within your event

873
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:32,520
database build focused queries within

874
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,900
your sim create rules using those lookup

875
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,839
data so it should be trigger notables

876
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,440
right so think about the HR example I

877
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:42,089
gave earlier min but connected to an HR

878
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,400
database and does so they start from

879
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:46,259
people if you understand that that

880
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,660
database is there and you could monitor

881
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,160
for commands like select star then you

882
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,759
can trigger a notable say somebody's

883
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,410
dumping and database once you have that

884
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,060
you can build your notables alert

885
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,710
notifications you can fill dashboards

886
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,140
around personal data you can build

887
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:02,280
report the report part is probably for

888
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,480
me the most important aspect because

889
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,490
that report part is going to allow you

890
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,869
to extract reports and feed them into

891
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,439
the whole process of personal data

892
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:12,570
breach and notifications once you've

893
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,820
done that you can trigger your your ir

894
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,960
process

895
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,640
what you get a notable and you

896
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,680
understand what's going on our process

897
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,990
to do the forensics you've got all the

898
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:26,990
notifications going out so what about

899
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:29,450
tools so for the discovery part you've

900
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:32,060
got one I've only actually ever found

901
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:34,669
one three tool if you know of any I'd be

902
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:37,250
happy you know I'd be grateful because I

903
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:40,310
the only one I've ever seen is free Edie

904
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:43,220
org and that basically hasn't had much

905
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:45,890
work done in donkey's years the others

906
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:48,109
are all basically commercial same with

907
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,700
the detections so you can use commercial

908
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,140
products you can use for the cloud you

909
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,520
can use Cass be here some of the

910
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,589
next-generation products are starting to

911
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,810
integrate things like personal data

912
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:59,750
detection but more importantly you can

913
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:03,140
actually use system on collecting event

914
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,430
IDs or you can use wim WMI ask this one

915
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,680
if you're actually doing that so you can

916
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,319
actually focus those two product those

917
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,109
two components of Windows to actually

918
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:16,310
use the data in Linux you can use audit

919
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:18,380
D right so in all it D all we have to do

920
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:21,110
is create more controls push them out to

921
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:23,390
your servers and send and send the logs

922
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,950
to the SIP and monitor those logs in

923
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,779
Windows you can kind of do the same

924
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,399
thing if you actually capturing event

925
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,860
logs and centers and centralizing them

926
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,320
you can use local policy to audio

927
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:36,530
objects s the problem with Windows is

928
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:39,230
but to actually audit a data of data

929
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,730
access or data manipulation you're not

930
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,800
looking for one event you're actually

931
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:45,290
looking for three or four events right

932
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,530
because you get basically a handle to

933
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:50,660
out to to an object was requested an

934
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:52,550
attempt to access the object was done it

935
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,799
might be deleted it might be edited but

936
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,630
and then you get a close so you've got

937
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,080
those four if you essentially created

938
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,400
four events you have to synchronize for

939
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,880
events to understand what's happening to

940
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,950
the data which I find really annoying

941
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,780
and really hard to do that's why I kind

942
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,669
of like using the system impersonal way

943
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:15,250
better

944
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:19,400
so you're augmenting your sins Jesus

945
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:21,950
saying so so much you're automating your

946
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,930
seams you figure your data into the into

947
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:27,740
your sim you capture those file events

948
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:29,690
it's not just about you know copying

949
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,089
externally it can be edit a file it can

950
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,369
be delete a file it can be modified file

951
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:36,828
you feed that into is feed out as what

952
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:39,319
comes into you into interface like Vimeo

953
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:41,869
off-site whatever you're using and then

954
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:44,660
you can actually build detection so this

955
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:46,220
first one the top one is as a vac book

956
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,618
from a homeo I'm just basically looking

957
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,598
at all my personal data pass and on

958
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:52,010
source file destination file path this

959
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,650
that kind of search is very noisy

960
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:58,869
because it just shows you every event

961
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,869
associated to any personal data object

962
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:05,990
the search below whoops this search here

963
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:07,670
is for Splunk and essentially what it's

964
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:13,129
doing is it's looking for any Network

965
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:15,380
uploads to one of the cloud service

966
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,680
providers or the cloud you know storage

967
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,849
storage out elements and the same same

968
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,819
thing we're looking at a source file

969
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:25,819
path looking at look up the personal

970
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:29,720
data and we do we'll just do dignity

971
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:33,430
dupe this also very noisy but and it's

972
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:37,038
specific to a certain end point agents

973
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,390
you do the same this this one is a bug

974
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,940
search where we're basically looking for

975
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:43,759
any file right file copy far move or

976
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,859
delete against allowed users so here I'm

977
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:47,900
actually targeting users were allowed to

978
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:50,299
do this operation or not an

979
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,740
opportunities to this operation and we

980
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:53,869
have a restricted personal data path the

981
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,879
idea is if you have like so for example

982
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:57,650
it's our data only and HR admin can

983
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,750
touch it so he'd be in the list of

984
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:03,200
allowed users the restricted personal

985
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,730
data path with the HR pass anybody smart

986
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,259
in their allowed users and touches one

987
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:08,900
of those paths gets a notification

988
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:11,859
saying you know this is what it gets

989
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:16,009
triggers an event basically not non or

990
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:17,690
unauthorized access so then you can

991
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:19,309
build a lot of examples that is just

992
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:23,059
some of the examples

993
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:24,650
what about notification so notification

994
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:27,109
really isn't that the incident response

995
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:29,659
process a person's problem right it's

996
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:34,519
not really part of these when you get to

997
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:35,900
it it's a response type at various

998
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,479
morning it has to have the right people

999
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,949
in the room and now you also have to

1000
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:41,899
have the right information in the room

1001
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:44,869
as well when you're actually escalating

1002
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,569
so the the the information that you need

1003
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,859
is number one the number of individuals

1004
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:51,409
were and the category of individuals

1005
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:53,119
concerned they also need the number of

1006
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:55,099
personal data records concerned why is

1007
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,349
you know the the obvious difference is

1008
00:40:55,099 --> 00:41:00,709
that an individual might have multiple

1009
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:04,549
personal data most personal data entries

1010
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:06,439
inside your organization so maybe it

1011
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:08,319
affects multiple personal impersonal

1012
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:10,969
data information for that one individual

1013
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,839
the name on the contact of your GPO

1014
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:15,949
hopefully you have that already that

1015
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,959
changes based on the structure of your

1016
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:19,519
organization and where the actual

1017
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:21,618
incident is occurring because you might

1018
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,808
want to report it in France if it's your

1019
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:25,130
French affiliate that's affected you

1020
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:27,019
might want to port but you know a lot of

1021
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:30,319
the cloud based organizations are using

1022
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:31,819
the DPO in Ireland as the DPA in

1023
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,919
Islanders as their authority

1024
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:35,449
so you just different aspects of that

1025
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:36,589
but that's usually a legal issue and

1026
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:38,119
that's usually the legal team will

1027
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:43,519
direct you in the right place and will

1028
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:44,719
play the right DPA likely consequences

1029
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:46,249
this is where the incident response team

1030
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,779
can have an input right because we all

1031
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:49,308
security professionals we know what can

1032
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:52,309
be done with the personal data to

1033
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:55,189
certain extent medications and mediation

1034
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,539
efforts that's important because when

1035
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:59,629
you're doing your notification you need

1036
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:01,099
to be able to tell the DPA what you're

1037
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,289
doing to stop it from occurring or

1038
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:04,390
continuing or what you're going to do to

1039
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:06,709
stop it from occurring in the future

1040
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,390
because in theory you should have had

1041
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:11,328
all of these controls and block and and

1042
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:15,319
straight leaven contained security as a

1043
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:17,089
security for Jesus and was my words you

1044
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:19,099
said have these security the security in

1045
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:21,199
place to protect the personal data if

1046
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:23,509
you get a breach that means that your

1047
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,039
security aspects haven't been as good as

1048
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:27,439
you thought they were so you need to be

1049
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,999
able to tell the DPA that you rebuilt we

1050
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:31,069
looking at what controls you have in

1051
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,589
place and what security constraints and

1052
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:33,569
putting into

1053
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:36,058
play around the personal data so that it

1054
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:37,529
won't happen again it's important

1055
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:39,809
because that will go into the decision

1056
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:42,239
of what happens when the ICO or the

1057
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:46,999
we'll take a look at finding and then

1058
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:49,380
punishment evaluated the severity I

1059
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:50,879
refer back to NSA as well they actually

1060
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,920
did a personal data breach severity

1061
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,150
assessment methodology and it's quite

1062
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,299
interesting because if you look at the

1063
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:59,969
top on the on the right that they've

1064
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:02,099
actually categorized based on the level

1065
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:04,170
of effectiveness right oh or how it'll

1066
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:05,700
affect the personal data you've Louis

1067
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,609
being just for millions right so

1068
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,470
re-entering passwords updating your your

1069
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:11,690
email addresses in certain places what

1070
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,009
[Music]

1071
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:17,670
it's annoying but it's not really

1072
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:19,650
critical to you to to your to to you as

1073
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:23,999
and it's not really harmful to that

1074
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:27,289
person well the worst is very high which

1075
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:30,538
is significant irreversible consequences

1076
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:32,069
so for example you know they get access

1077
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:35,609
to your bank account and they enter your

1078
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:37,469
bank account right that's we or it

1079
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:41,969
creates substantial long-term

1080
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:43,499
psychological physical to do things so

1081
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:44,479
maybe you know the person Bailey gets

1082
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:46,558
out of that your

1083
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:49,950
you know that should pop you you're part

1084
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,809
of an LGBT organization and it gets

1085
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:53,759
leaked to people and it affects you

1086
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:55,140
affects you morally you have problems

1087
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:56,789
with that and you know needs to order

1088
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,979
mental health at lunch mental health

1089
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:02,069
issues so that's the kind of thing that

1090
00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:03,419
you're going to look at evaluating again

1091
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:04,619
this is probably not so I think the

1092
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,359
insulin response team needs to do by

1093
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:07,559
itself but it's something important to

1094
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:10,229
understand because if you can help

1095
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:11,430
actually direct an understanding to the

1096
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:16,468
legal team what could happen with the

1097
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:21,109
personal data that's been leaked now I

1098
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:24,930
typically I do so I like to do a session

1099
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:26,880
a slightly longer session where I

1100
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,669
actually throw out questions to the

1101
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,339
audience right to help them understand

1102
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,650
but also to help you work through I poke

1103
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:37,259
I put these up for a while I will

1104
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,420
actually do the session we're running

1105
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:41,279
out of time but I'll put these up these

1106
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,869
are good questions to ask yourself when

1107
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,620
you're looking at your IR process and

1108
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:45,750
how you're having

1109
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,460
data breaches so things like how you

1110
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,320
what how your legislation it applies

1111
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,820
requests made you change your eye out

1112
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,530
process have you changed it

1113
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,290
you know what model you're using how do

1114
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:56,340
you adapt that model what events are you

1115
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,580
looking for when you're doing a data

1116
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:02,310
breach are you including personal data

1117
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:04,279
in a red team exercise how do you test

1118
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:08,640
that how do you know that's working

1119
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,990
what's your definition of PII when do

1120
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,150
you store the personal data where is it

1121
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,319
stored how do you track when it's stored

1122
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,610
when it's taken away from the

1123
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,050
application for example on stored

1124
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:22,380
locally how do you identify the personal

1125
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:27,000
data whose needs to be in your revised

1126
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:31,230
information response team and when do

1127
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,840
you call them final force data breaches

1128
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:35,220
are here to stay right we're not going

1129
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,720
to get rid of them the whole point of

1130
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:38,310
GDP I want to stop them from happening

1131
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,290
or not sacrifice you because they're

1132
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,880
happening the point of GPR is that you

1133
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,380
need to be able to say that the

1134
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:49,290
organization's need to take measures to

1135
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:51,750
take personal data funnily enough I got

1136
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:54,779
a few notifications including the one

1137
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,730
from VA right but I got some of these

1138
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:01,560
two notifications from I haven't been

1139
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:06,210
pawned what I didn't understand was why

1140
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:08,220
I got these this was a bit odd look one

1141
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:11,910
eye handy I've never even registered on

1142
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:17,390
this site I have no idea where it came

1143
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:19,410
from and this one I found out I've

1144
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,940
basically what you do is when you get

1145
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:24,060
one of these is you the first thing you

1146
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,830
do is you file you find a subject access

1147
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,360
request to the to the organization to

1148
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,680
find out why they have your personal

1149
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,830
data because especially if you don't

1150
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,839
recognize why I did that I've never been

1151
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,360
to these sites this one is never

1152
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,640
responded this one responded in time and

1153
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,200
interestingly enough they didn't have

1154
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,660
that much personally they just had my

1155
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,330
email address but the funny thing was is

1156
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,540
that it was because I clicked on a link

1157
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,720
to do a share of an article like four or

1158
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,009
five years ago

1159
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,410
and I'm wondering why the hell do they

1160
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:58,880
still have that information

1161
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:02,640
after five years what's the point right

1162
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,560
so you need that's a lot of things to do

1163
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,230
right and from the security point point

1164
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:17,779
teens point of view de there's a lot of

1165
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:24,720
work oops one button so that's it

1166
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:25,640
questions I've adored you into

1167
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,020
submission

1168
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,250
plus it's lunchtime so I know it's like

1169
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,750
I always get put before or after lunch

1170
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,750
which is really annoying

1171
00:47:33,530 --> 00:48:12,210
very good yeah what I would in that

1172
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,220
situation your best bet is is an

1173
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,500
endpoint technology but actually can see

1174
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,939
the email before it gets encrypted so

1175
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:22,140
you can track it when it's coming in and

1176
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:24,150
out it's the best time so I have for you

1177
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,190
because it is a really big problem just

1178
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:28,290
once it's encrypted is technical so once

1179
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,940
it's encrypted it falls within clear

1180
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:32,910
parameters of data protection and

1181
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,710
encryption in transit the problem is is

1182
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,660
you don't understand what's being sent

1183
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,950
and the only way to understand what's

1184
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,350
being sent is to look at what's

1185
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,660
happening from the sender's point of

1186
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,980
view right so if you're using a cloud if

1187
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,629
using the cloud service you can usually

1188
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,640
get through that because you can put

1189
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,380
something like I mean like using it

1190
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,479
office 365

1191
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:54,420
even before you gets encrypted if you

1192
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:56,640
can put the DLP agent on the office365

1193
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,589
interface and all get especially using

1194
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,589
the web interface if you're using

1195
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:03,180
endpoint email email system ale the

1196
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:04,470
clients you need to have something on

1197
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,690
the endpoint that's going to read the

1198
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:08,220
email before it gets encrypted there's

1199
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:10,920
gonna be able to process the text buffer

1200
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,569
essentially which is really hard which

1201
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,680
is really hard really annoying and works

1202
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:19,558
on and off it's it's a I mean it's a

1203
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,538
complicated issue I've worked with some

1204
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:26,099
organizations basically what we turned

1205
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:30,420
we did is we looked at identifying when

1206
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,829
the user was actually maybe copying a CV

1207
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:35,579
or maybe copying personal information

1208
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:37,710
locally before it gets sent sent up so

1209
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:40,079
we were doing and try to do what we try

1210
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:42,359
to do is to event Association so you're

1211
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,549
looking for a you know maybe access to

1212
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:47,749
the HR application or access to the to

1213
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:50,640
the so the tracking out to the database

1214
00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:53,939
when that user accesses that database

1215
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,558
copies information locally you have you

1216
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,849
know that it's he's basically copied a

1217
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,849
piece of personal data information

1218
00:49:56,849 --> 00:50:01,829
locally but that doesn't that's not

1219
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:03,660
necessarily a violation but then once

1220
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:06,749
you say a few seconds later a few

1221
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:11,160
minutes later you see an email go out to

1222
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:15,259
an external email address you can flag a

1223
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:17,629
you know low-risk type of event and

1224
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:19,880
investigate it further if you need to

1225
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,469
the idea of being would you actually

1226
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,450
you've generated an event so you know

1227
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:27,210
that something happened but you're never

1228
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:39,538
gonna be sure it's it's a heart it's the

1229
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:40,619
it's difficult problem so okay so with

1230
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:43,979
actually because that's a group that's a

1231
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:46,799
good point right so if you get a subject

1232
00:50:43,979 --> 00:50:49,589
access request to remove any personal

1233
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:51,559
data didn't the legislation actually

1234
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:54,690
says to you the best of your abilities

1235
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:58,510
right so if you do so it's the same

1236
00:50:54,690 --> 00:51:00,430
problem with database backups right what

1237
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,260
happens is is a let's say you have

1238
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:05,319
database backups and you have both

1239
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:07,180
online and off site of you know offline

1240
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,250
backups right offline backups usually on

1241
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,629
tape how you actually delete one

1242
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:13,390
personal piece of information from a

1243
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:16,030
tape you can't write it's it's an

1244
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:18,069
impossible task so the recommendation is

1245
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:22,330
essentially you build an asset database

1246
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:24,730
of subjects that I asked you for so it's

1247
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,799
been asked for a a you have issued a

1248
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,450
subject has request for two right to be

1249
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,730
forgotten

1250
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:32,069
you keep track of those names so that

1251
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,240
when you do a restore when you're

1252
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,170
rebuilding date when you're rebuilding

1253
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,839
personal data

1254
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,640
you don't actually riad that name right

1255
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,230
so you need to update your process in

1256
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:44,200
terms of how you're actually processing

1257
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:46,930
and keeping track of what data needs to

1258
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:52,779
be deleted or not it doesn't help with

1259
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:54,460
the email issue but if there's an aspect

1260
00:51:52,780 --> 00:52:00,400
if you need to trust your people to a

1261
00:51:54,460 --> 00:52:34,720
certain extent it's not easy it's not

1262
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:42,190
easy I knew that I really can't answer

1263
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:46,839
because I'm not aware yeah so the

1264
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:49,780
computer the CA was a computer CFA that

1265
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:52,570
appear for act or whatever is it it is

1266
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:55,180
behind versus what the Data Protection

1267
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:59,010
Act is when does it become a criminal

1268
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:59,009
act that I don't know

1269
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:11,849
[Music]

1270
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:17,538
well the announcement is if you have

1271
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:20,399
malicious actor whether

1272
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:21,979
internal/external and the access data

1273
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:25,288
and it's you know the exit rate data

1274
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:28,558
that's what the extra rights of

1275
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:31,439
different forms of the CFA right but the

1276
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:35,309
internal actor that really depends on on

1277
00:53:31,439 --> 00:53:37,558
your edges of policy it will depend on

1278
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:39,449
the privacy policies or we know that

1279
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:42,299
data whatever they the policy you have

1280
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:43,829
in place for I mean I don't know for the

1281
00:53:42,299 --> 00:53:47,130
personal data perspective unauthorized

1282
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:48,509
access is really forced under what's

1283
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,369
your privacy policy and how did you

1284
00:53:48,509 --> 00:53:52,799
collect data if you collected the data

1285
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:55,769
and you said it's going to be used only

1286
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:58,409
for HR to be able to know they evaluate

1287
00:53:55,769 --> 00:54:00,269
your candidacy for the job then

1288
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:02,729
technically that data can only be share

1289
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:06,299
with the people in that process right if

1290
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:09,359
an admin comes in opens the data copies

1291
00:54:06,299 --> 00:54:11,849
it or prints it that's a violation is it

1292
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:14,699
is it a legal violation is it a criminal

1293
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:17,699
act no it's not it's just some I mean if

1294
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:19,679
it's taken you know excessive steps can

1295
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:23,279
you know will you probably fire the guy

1296
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:25,189
maybe right because he you know he was

1297
00:54:23,279 --> 00:54:29,489
overstepped his boundaries

1298
00:54:25,189 --> 00:54:31,408
when it comes to criminal acts I have to

1299
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:33,749
defer to a lawyer to really understand

1300
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:36,539
have to defer to a waiter to look into

1301
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:37,769
that because internal I don't see very

1302
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:39,389
many criminal acts unless you actually

1303
00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:41,339
you know blackmail in the company or

1304
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:44,909
selling their own online something on

1305
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:55,639
our it's past its phases of the of the

1306
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:55,639
breach any other questions

1307
00:54:57,349 --> 00:55:25,430
I use trial and error trial now it works

1308
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,269
really well well that that's one of the

1309
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:29,779
reasons I'm trying to build this

1310
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:31,729
database of detection patterns because

1311
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:33,109
it's it's really hard I mean even some

1312
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:35,868
of the passport ones they trigger false

1313
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:37,489
positives like crazy the National

1314
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:40,970
Insurance number triggers triggers of

1315
00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:42,410
false positive all the time you know in

1316
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:48,288
French have a national ID it's like a

1317
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:49,999
12-digit number I this doesn't what

1318
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:52,489
there's a national idea but there's also

1319
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:54,799
a medical ID the medical ID you can

1320
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:56,650
actually kind of reduce the false

1321
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:01,729
positives because the first

1322
00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:05,239
ten digits are fixed based on yours your

1323
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:09,140
sex the year of birth country of birth

1324
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:11,690
why she it's a department of birth and a

1325
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:13,729
couple of other a fixed organization

1326
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:15,859
administrative information so you've got

1327
00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:16,999
that first ten judges you can relax and

1328
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:19,460
then afterwards it's just a bunch of

1329
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:22,669
numbers so that so that makes the right

1330
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:25,960
that complicates the regex enormously it

1331
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:28,670
is a lot of false positives right i we

1332
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,769
I've done eat discoveries with a couple

1333
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:33,739
of companies after the first day we hit

1334
00:56:30,769 --> 00:56:35,479
like one to five million entries the

1335
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:36,890
guys just said stop because this is this

1336
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:39,348
number one it's not very useful another

1337
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:40,368
two so that we don't want to know like

1338
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:43,880
you're gonna have to know in the future

1339
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:44,690
so you know we'll start but at some

1340
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,809
point in time you're gonna have to

1341
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:49,219
address it because even if we even even

1342
00:56:47,809 --> 00:56:53,479
with false positives we we had

1343
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:55,219
fine-tuned the Reg exist to a specific

1344
00:56:53,479 --> 00:56:56,359
set of information but they were

1345
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:58,400
collecting or they knew they were

1346
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:59,989
collecting then we reduce the false

1347
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,479
positive rate to about ten fifteen

1348
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:04,400
percent so even on five million entries

1349
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:06,319
ten fifteen percent it's not you know

1350
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,869
compared to the positive entries it's

1351
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,980
not that much and usually what I found

1352
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:13,109
is it when you get to that stain

1353
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,220
is especially if you're doing your

1354
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:16,589
discovery you're trying to build that

1355
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:18,000
asset that asset database as most

1356
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:19,589
organizations tell you piss off because

1357
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,849
essentially you've generated so much

1358
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:23,670
data they just don't want to know the

1359
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:26,609
probability problem that's that's a

1360
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:28,140
different matter altogether right but at

1361
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,509
the end of the day some organizations

1362
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,040
just don't want to adil it they'll deal

1363
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:40,619
with the fine when if it happens and

1364
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:44,130
when it happens where times up I think

1365
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:46,310
lunch is next right thanks everybody for

1366
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,310
this
